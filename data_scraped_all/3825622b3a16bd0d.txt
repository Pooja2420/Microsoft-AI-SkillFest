Applies to:Azure Logic Apps (Consumption + Standard)
To access and run IBM mainframe apps, which you usually execute by navigating through 3270 emulator screens, from Consumption and Standard workflows in Azure Logic Apps, you can use theIBM 3270connector. That way, you can integrate your IBM mainframe apps with Azure, Microsoft, and other apps, services, and systems by creating automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps. The connector communicates with IBM mainframes by using the TN3270 protocol. TheIBM 3270connector is available in all Azure Logic Apps regions except for Azure Government and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.
This how-to guide describes the following aspects about theIBM 3270connector:

Why use this connector?
To access apps on IBM mainframes, you typically use a 3270 terminal emulator, often called a "green screen". This method is a time-tested way but has limitations. Although Host Integration Server (HIS) helps you work
directly with these apps, sometimes, separating the screen and business logic might not be possible. Or, maybe you no longer have information for how the host applications work.
To extend these scenarios, theIBM 3270connector in Azure Logic Apps works with the3270 Design Tool, which you use to record, or "capture", the host screens used for a specific task, define the navigation flow for that task through your mainframe app, and define the methods with input and output parameters for that task. The design tool converts that information into metadata that the 3270 connector uses when running an action in your workflow.
After you generate the metadata file from the 3270 Design Tool, you add that file as a map artifact either to your Standard logic app resource or to your linked integration account for a Consumption logic app in Azure Logic Apps. That way, your workflow can access your app's metadata when you add anIBM 3270connector action. The connector reads the metadata file from your logic app resource (Standard) or your integration account (Consumption), handles navigation through the 3270 screens, and dynamically presents the parameters to use with the 3270 connector in your workflow. You can then provide data to the host application, and the connector returns the results to your workflow. As a result, you can integrate your legacy apps with Azure, Microsoft, and other apps, services, and systems that Azure Logic Apps supports.
Connector technical reference
The IBM 3270 connector has different versions, based onlogic app type and host environment.

Built-in connector reference
The following section describes the operations for the IBM 3270 connector, which currently includes only the following action:
Execute a navigation plan
This operation also includes advanced parameters, which appear after you select a method, for you to select and use with the selected method. These parameters vary based on your HIDX file and the method that you select.

The only prerequisite isMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8.This tool helps you record the screens, navigation paths, methods, and parameters for the tasks in your app that you add and run as 3270 connector actions. The tool generates a Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file that provides the necessary metadata for the connector to run your 3270 screen-driven app.After you download and install this tool,follow these steps to connect with your TN3270 host server, design the required metadata artifact, and generate the HIDX file.

Later in this guide, when you add anIBM 3270connector action to your workflow for the first time, you're prompted to create a connection between your workflow and the mainframe system. After you create the connection, you can select your previously added HIDX file, the method to run, and the parameters to use.

Add an IBM 3270 action
A Standard logic app workflow can use the IBM 3270 managed connector and the IBM 3270 built-in connector. However, a Consumption logic app workflow can use only the IBM 3270 managed connector. Each version has different actions. Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard logic app workflow, follow the corresponding steps:
