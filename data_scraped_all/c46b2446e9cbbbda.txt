This article describes reliability support in Microsoft Purview for governance experiences, and covers both regional resiliency withavailability zonesanddisaster recovery and business continuity. For a more detailed overview of reliability principles in Azure, seeAzure reliability.
Availability zone support
Availability zones are physically separate groups of datacenters within each Azure region. When one zone fails, services can fail over to one of the remaining zones.
For more information on availability zones in Azure, seeWhat are availability zones?
Microsoft Purview makes commercially reasonable efforts to support zone-redundant availability zones, where resources automatically replicate across zones, without any need for you to set up or configure.
Prerequisites
Microsoft Purview governance experience currently provides partial availability-zone support ina limited number of regions. This partial availability-zone support covers experiences (and/or certain functionalities within an experience).
Zone availability might or might not be available for Microsoft Purview governance experiences or features/functionalities that are in preview.
Supported regions
Microsoft Purview makes commercially reasonable efforts to provide availability zone support in various regions as follows:
Disaster recovery and business continuity
Disaster recovery (DR) refers to practices that organizations use to recover from high-impact events, such as natural disasters or failed deployments that result in downtime and data loss. Regardless of the cause, the best remedy for a disaster is a well-defined and tested DR plan and an application design that actively supports DR. Before you start creating your disaster recovery plan, seeRecommendations for designing a disaster recovery strategy.
For DR, Microsoft uses theshared responsibility model. In this model, Microsoft ensures that the baseline infrastructure and platform services are available. However, many Azure services don't automatically replicate data or fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. For those services, you're responsible for setting up a disaster recovery plan that works for your workload. Most services that run on Azure platform as a service (PaaS) offerings provide features and guidance to support DR. You can useservice-specific features to support fast recoveryto help develop your DR plan.
Important
Today, Microsoft Purview doesn't support automated disaster recovery. Until that support is added, you're responsible to take care of backup and restore activities. You can manually create a secondary Microsoft Purview account as a warm standby instance in another region. Note that this standby instance in another region would not support Microsoft Purview Data Governance Solution. Today, it only supports Azure Purview solution. We are working on adding DR support for Microsoft Purview Data Governance Solution.
To implement disaster recovery for Microsoft Purview, see theMicrosoft Purview disaster recovery documentation.
