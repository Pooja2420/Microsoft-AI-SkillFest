Snapshotsenable point-in-time recovery of volumes. You can schedule forvolume snapshotsto be taken automatically by using snapshot policies. You can also modify a snapshot policy as needed, or delete a snapshot policy that you no longer need.
Create a snapshot policy
A snapshot policy enables you to specify the snapshot creation frequency in hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly cycles. You also need to specify the maximum number of snapshots to retain for the volume.
Note
In case of a service maintenance event, Azure NetApp Files might sporadically skip the creation of a scheduled snapshot.
From the NetApp Account view, selectSnapshot policy.

If you intend for the monthly snapshot configuration to work for all months in the year, pick a day of the month between 1 and 28.

If you need to create additional snapshot policies, repeat Step 3.
The policies you created appear in the Snapshot policy page.
If you want a volume to use the snapshot policy, you need toapply the policy to the volume.
Apply a snapshot policy to a volume
If you want a volume to use a snapshot policy that you created, you need to apply the policy to the volume.
You cannot apply a snapshot policy to a destination volume in cross-region replication.
Go to theVolumespage, right-click the volume that you want to apply a snapshot policy to, and selectEdit.
Go to theVolumespage, right-click the volume that you want to apply a snapshot policy to, and selectEdit.

In the Edit window, underSnapshot policy, select a policy to use for the volume. SelectOKto apply the policy.

Modify a snapshot policy
You can modify an existing snapshot policy to change the policy state, snapshot frequency (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly), or number of snapshots to keep.
Important
When modifying a snapshot policy, make note of the naming format. Snapshots created with policies modified before March 2022 will have a long name, for exampledaily-0-min-past-1am.2022-11-03_0100, while snapshots created with policies after March 2022 will have a shorter name, for exampledaily.2022-11-29_0100.
daily-0-min-past-1am.2022-11-03_0100
daily.2022-11-29_0100
If your snapshot policy is creating snapshots using the long naming convention, modifications to the snapshot policy will not be applied to existing snapshots. The snapshots created with the previous schedule will not be deleted or overwritten by the new schedule. You will have to manually delete the old snapshots.
If your snapshot policy is creating snapshots using the short naming convention, policy modifications will be applied to the existing snapshots.
