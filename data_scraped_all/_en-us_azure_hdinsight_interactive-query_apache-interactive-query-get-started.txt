Interactive Query (also called Apache Hive LLAP, orLow Latency Analytical Processing) is an Azure HDInsightcluster type. Interactive Query supports in-memory caching, which makes Apache Hive queries faster and much more interactive. Customers use Interactive Query to query data stored in Azure storage & Azure Data Lake Storage in super-fast manner. Interactive query makes it easy for developers and data scientist to work with the big data using BI tools they love the most. HDInsight Interactive Query supports several tools to access big data in easy fashion.

An Interactive Query cluster is different from an Apache Hadoop cluster. It contains only the Hive service.
You can access the Hive service in the Interactive Query cluster only via Apache Ambari Hive View, Beeline, and the Microsoft Hive Open Database Connectivity driver (Hive ODBC). You can't access it via the Hive console, Templeton, the Azure Classic CLI, or Azure PowerShell.
Create an Interactive Query cluster
For information about creating a HDInsight cluster, seeCreate Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight. Choose the Interactive Query cluster type.
Important
The minimum headnode size for Interactive Query clusters is Standard_D13_v2. For more information, see theAzure Virtual Machine Sizing Chart.
