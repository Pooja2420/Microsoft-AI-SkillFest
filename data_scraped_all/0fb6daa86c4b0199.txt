Examples
Filter data based on comparison between adjacent rows
The following query returns rows that show breaks longer than a quarter of a second between calls tosensor-9.
sensor-9
Run the query
TransformedSensorsData
| where SensorName == 'sensor-9'
| sort by Timestamp asc
| extend timeDiffInMilliseconds = datetime_diff('millisecond', next(Timestamp, 1), Timestamp)
| where timeDiffInMilliseconds > 250
TransformedSensorsData
| where SensorName == 'sensor-9'
| sort by Timestamp asc
| extend timeDiffInMilliseconds = datetime_diff('millisecond', next(Timestamp, 1), Timestamp)
| where timeDiffInMilliseconds > 250
Output
Perform aggregation based on comparison between adjacent rows
The following query calculates the average time difference in milliseconds between calls tosensor-9.
sensor-9
Run the query
TransformedSensorsData
| where SensorName == 'sensor-9'
| sort by Timestamp asc
| extend timeDiffInMilliseconds = datetime_diff('millisecond', next(Timestamp, 1), Timestamp)
| summarize avg(timeDiffInMilliseconds)
TransformedSensorsData
| where SensorName == 'sensor-9'
| sort by Timestamp asc
| extend timeDiffInMilliseconds = datetime_diff('millisecond', next(Timestamp, 1), Timestamp)
| summarize avg(timeDiffInMilliseconds)
Output
Extend row with data from the next row
In the following query, as part of the serialization done with theserialize operator, a new columnnext_session_typeis added with data from the next row.
next_session_type
Run the query
ConferenceSessions
| where conference == 'Build 2019'
| serialize next_session_type = next(session_type)
| project time_and_duration, session_title, session_type, next_session_type
ConferenceSessions
| where conference == 'Build 2019'
| serialize next_session_type = next(session_type)
| project time_and_duration, session_title, session_type, next_session_type
