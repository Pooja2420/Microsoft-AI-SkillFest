Germany IT-Grundschutz workbook overview
To help organizations secure IT systems, theGerman Federal Office for Information Security(Bundesamt fÃ¼r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, or BSI) created a baseline set of standards for protecting information technology (in German, IT-Grundschutz). These standards consist of:
BSI Standard 200-1 defines an an information security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001
BSI Standard 200-2 describes how to set up and operate an ISMS according to the IT-Grundschutz methodology
BSI Standard 200-3 contains all risk-related tasks
The IT-Grundschutz Catalogues describe potential threats and safeguards for typical business environments
Microsoft and IT-Grundschutz workbooks
To help you achieve your IT-Grundschutz certification, Microsoft Germany has published the IT-Grundschutz Compliance workbooks for solutions and workloads deployed on Azure, Dynamics 365, and Office 365. Developed by HiSolutions AG, an independent consulting and auditing firm in Germany, the workbooks are based on IT-Grundschutz Catalogue 2021, which includes modules covering internet and cloud usage, such as OPS.2.2 Cloud Usage, and updates to the IT-Grundschutz Catalogue from 2023.
These workbooks can help you implement the IT-Grundschutz methodology within the scope of your existing or planned ISO/IEC 27001 certification. They describe how to apply the IT-Grundschutz methodology to applications in the cloud and outline how to implement all audit-relevant safeguards from the IT-Grundschutz module OPS.2.2 Cloud Usage. The workbooks also provide information about implementing the BSIMinimum Standard on the Usage of External Cloud Servicesfor German federal authorities.
