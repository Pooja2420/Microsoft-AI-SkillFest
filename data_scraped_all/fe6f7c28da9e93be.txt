This article summarizes support information for Container capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Note
Specific features are in preview. TheAzure Preview Supplemental Termsinclude other legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Only the versions of AKS, EKS and GKE supported by the cloud vendor are officially supported by Defender for Cloud.
The following are the features provided by Defender for Containers, for the supported cloud environments and container registries.
Vulnerability assessment (VA) features
Azure
AWS
GCP
Arc Connected clusters
1National clouds are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.
Runtime protection features
Azure
AWS
GCP
Arc enabled Kubernetes clusters
1Any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters should be supported, but only the specified clusters have been tested on Azure.
2To getMicrosoft Defender for Containersprotection for your environments, you need to onboardAzure Arc-enabled Kubernetesand enable Defender for Containers as an Arc extension.

Supported host operating systems
Defender for Containers relies on the Defender sensor for several features. The Defender sensor is supported only with Linux Kernel 5.4 and above, on the following host operating systems:
Amazon Linux 2
CentOS 8  (CentOS is End Of Service as of June 30, 2024. For more information, see theCentOS End Of Life guidance.)
Debian 10
Debian 11
Google Container-Optimized OS
Azure Linux 1.0
Azure Linux 2.0
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
Ubuntu 16.04
Ubuntu 18.04
Ubuntu 20.04
Ubuntu 22.04
Ensure your Kubernetes node is running on one of these verified operating systems. Clusters with unsupported host operating systems don't get the benefits of features relying on Defender sensor.
Defender sensor limitations
The Defender sensor in AKS V1.28 and below isn't supported on Arm64 nodes.
