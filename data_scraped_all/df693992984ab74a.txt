Azure NetApp Files backup expands the data protection capabilities of Azure NetApp Files by providing fully managed backup solution for long-term recovery, archive, and compliance. Backups created by the service are stored in Azure storage, independent of volume snapshots that are available for near-term recovery or cloning. Backups taken by the service can be restored to new Azure NetApp Files volumes within the region. Azure NetApp Files backup supports both policy-based (scheduled) backups and manual (on-demand) backups. For more information, seeHow Azure NetApp Files snapshots work.

Backup vault
Backup vaults are organizational units to manage backups. You must create a backup vault before you can create a backup.
Although it's possible to create multiple backup vaults in your Azure NetApp Files account, it's recommended you have only one backup vault.
Important
If you have existing backups on Azure NetApp Files, you must migrate the backups to a backup vault before you can perform any operation with the backup. To learn how to migrate, seeManage backup vaults.
Cost model for Azure NetApp Files backup
Pricing for Azure NetApp Files backup is based on the total amount of storage consumed by the backup. There are no setup charges or minimum usage fees.
Backup restore is priced based on the total amount of backup capacity restored during the billing cycle.
As a pricing example, assume the following situations:
Your source volume is from the Azure NetApp Files Premium service level. It has a volume quota size of 1000 GiB and a volume consumed size of 500 GiB at the beginning of the first day of a month. The volume is in the US South Central region.
For simplicity, assume your source volume has a constant 1% data change every day, but the total volume consumed size doesn't grow (remains at 500 GiB).
When the backup policy is assigned to the volume, the baseline backup to service-managed Azure storage is initiated. When the backup is complete, the baseline backup of 500 GiB will be added to the backup list of the volume. After the baseline transfer, daily backups only back up changed blocks. Assume 5-GiB daily incremental backups added, the total backup storage consumed would be500GiB + 30*5GiB = 650GiB.
500GiB + 30*5GiB = 650GiB
You'll be billed at the end of month for backup at the rate of $0.05 per month for the total amount of storage consumed by the backup.  That is, 650 GiB with a total monthly backup charge of650*$0.05=$32.5. Regular Azure NetApp Files storage capacity applies to local snapshots. For more information, see theAzure NetApp Files Pricingpage.
650*$0.05=$32.5
If you choose to restore a backup of, for example, 600 GiB to a new volume, you'll be charged at the rate of $0.02 per GiB of backup capacity restores. In this case, it will be600*$0.02 = $12for the restore operation.
600*$0.02 = $12
