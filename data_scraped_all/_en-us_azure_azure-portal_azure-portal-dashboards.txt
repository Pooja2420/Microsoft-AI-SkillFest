Dashboards are a focused and organized view of your cloud resources in the Azure portal. Use dashboards as a workspace where you can monitor resources and quickly launch tasks for day-to-day operations. For example, you can build custom dashboards based on projects, tasks, or user roles in your organization.

The Azure portal provides a default dashboard as a starting point. You can edit this default dashboard, and you can create and customize additional dashboards.
All dashboards are private when created, and each user can create up to 100 private dashboards. If you publish andshare a dashboard with other users in your organization, the shared dashboard is implemented as an Azure resource in your subscription, and doesn't count towards the private dashboard limit.

This example shows how to create a new private dashboard with an assigned name.

Tip
If you have an existing dashboard and want to create a new one that is similar, you canclone your dashboardand use the duplicate copy as a starting point.
Edit a dashboard
Now, let's edit the example dashboard you created to add, resize, and arrange tiles that show your Azure resources or display other helpful information. We'll start by working with the Tile Gallery, then explore other ways to customize dashboards.
Add tiles from the Tile Gallery
To add tiles to a dashboard by using the Tile Gallery, follow these steps.
SelectEditfrom the dashboard's page header.

SelectEditfrom the page header.

Select the context menu in the upper right corner of a tile. Then, choose a tile size. Tiles that support any size also include a "handle" in the lower right corner that lets you drag the tile to the size you want.

Pin content from a resource page
Another way to add tiles to your dashboard is directly from a resource page.
Many resource pages include a pin icon in the page header, which means that you can pin a tile representing the source page. In some cases, a pin icon may also appear by specific content within a page, which means you can pin a tile for that specific content, rather than the entire page.

Select this icon to pin the tile to an existing private or shared dashboard. You can also create a new dashboard which will include this pin by selectingCreate new.

Copy a tile to a new dashboard
If you want to reuse a tile on a different dashboard, you can copy it from one dashboard to another. To do so, select the context menu in the upper right corner and then selectCopy.

You can then select whether to copy the tile to a different private or shared dashboard, or create a copy of the tile within the dashboard you're already working in. You can also create a new dashboard that includes a copy of the tile by selectingCreate new.
Modify tile settings

Some tiles might require more configuration to show the information you want. For example, theMetrics charttile has to be set up to display a metric from Azure Monitor. You can also customize tile data to override the dashboard's default time settings and filters, or to change the title and subtitle of a tile.
Note
TheMarkdowntile lets you display custom, static content on your dashboard. This can be any information you provide, such as basic instructions, an image, a set of hyperlinks, or even contact information. For more information about using markdown tiles, seeUse a markdown tile on Azure dashboards to show custom content.
Change the title and subtitle of a tile
Some tiles allow you to edit their title and/or subtitle. To do so, selectConfigure tile settingsfrom the context menu.

Make your changes, then selectApply.

Complete tile configuration
Any tile that requires configuration displays a banner until you customize the tile. For example, in theMetrics chart, the banner readsEdit in Metrics. Other banners may use different text, such asConfigure tile.
To customize the tile:
If needed, selectSaveorCancelnear the top of the page to exit edit mode.

Apply dashboard filters
Near the top of your dashboard, you'll see options to set theAuto refreshandTime settingsfor data displayed in the dashboard, along with an option to add additional filters.

To change how often data is refreshed, selectAuto refresh, then choose a new refresh interval. When you've made your selection, selectApply.
The default time settings areUTC Time, showing data for thePast 24 hours. To change this, select the button and choose a new time range, time granularity, and/or time zone, then selectApply.
To apply additional filters, selectAdd filter. The options you'll see will vary depending on the tiles in your dashboard. For example, you may see options to filter data for a specific subscription or location. In some cases, you'll see that no additional filters are available.
If you see additional filter options, select the one you'd like to use and make your selections. The filter will then be applied to your data.
To remove a filter, select theXin its button.
Override dashboard filters for specific tiles
Tiles which support filtering have afilter icon in the top-left corner of the tile. These tiles allow you to override the global filters with filters specific to that tile.
To do so, selectConfigure tile settingsfrom the tile's context menu, or select the filter icon. Then you can change the desired filters for that tile. For example, some tiles provide an option to override the dashboard time settings at the tile level,  allowing you to select a different time span to refresh data.
When you apply filters for a particular tile, the left corner of that tile changes to show a double filter icon, indicating that the data in that tile reflects its own filters.

Delete a tile
To remove a tile from a dashboard, do one of the following:
Select the context menu in the upper right corner of the tile, then selectRemove from dashboard.
Select the context menu in the upper right corner of the tile, then selectRemove from dashboard.
