A board presents work items in the form of cards, where each card represents a work item that facilitates information sharing, progress tracking, and task assignment. These cards provide quick insights for you and your team. You can update a field on a card without having to open the corresponding work item. You can also apply style rules to highlight specific cards and tasks based on your set criteria.
Note
This article addresses customization of a board. For information on customizing a Taskboard, seeCustomize sprint Taskboards.
Prerequisites
Card customization options
You can show fields on cards based on what your team frequently refers to or updates when using the board. You can also add fields with information that you can use to filter the board.
Note
You can customize a work item type which is different than customizing the card displayed on the board. You customize a work item type by adding fields, changing the workflow, adding custom rules and more. You can also add custom work item types and custom backlog levels. For more information, seeCustomize an inheritance process.
Within theSettings dialog for a board, you have the following customization options.
Note
Each team can customize the cards for their board. Board settings are not inherited from other teams that they may share portions of area paths.
Card customization sequence
Before you configure the cards, ensure the following tasks are complete, or you might need to revisit your configuration.
Process Administrator:
Add custom work item types that you want to appear on your backlog or board. For more information, seeAdd and manage work item types.
Customize your product and portfolio backlogs to ensure all the work item types you want to have appear on the backlogs and boards. For details seeCustomize backlogs & boards.
Customize each work item type to have any custom fields you want to show. For more information, seeCustomize a workflow.
Team Administrator:
Meet with your team and determine how the team wants to manage bugs, similar to requirements or tasks.
Add any tagsyou want to customize on cards to work items.
Meet with your team and determine which annotations should appear on cards and how they want to configure inline tests.
Open your board settings
If you're not a team admin,get added as one. Only team and project admins can customize the board.
You can customize cards that appear on the board for your product backlog or portfolio backlog such as features and epics. You follow similar steps, however you start from thecorresponding portfolio backlog.

Choose which fields appear on cards
You can edit a card field from the board, except for read-only fields like theChange ByandChanged Date. This quick update feature is useful when you need to update many work items at once.
Do the following steps to update fields. To add a custom field, you must firstadd it to the process used to customize the project.
From the board settings page, chooseFieldsand then choose a work item type to see all the settings that you can modify. Your initial column settings appear similar to the following image.Your choices vary based on theprocessused to create your project and whether your team has chosen totreat bugs like requirements or like tasks.

To show theTitleof the parent work item, choose theParentfield. Choosing theParenttitle from a card opens the parent work item. To change the parent work item, open the child work item and remove the link and add a different parent work item. You can filter your board based on parent work items, whether theParentfield is added to cards or not.


Define style rules to highlight cards
With styling rules, you can cause cards to change color when their corresponding work items meet criteria that you set. Here, we highlight severity 1 bugs by having the cards display as yellow.

Examples of styling rules
Which rules should you apply to highlight work items? Here are a few examples and their associated criteria.
Priority = 1
Effort 20
Story Points 20
Changed Date @Today-5
Title Contains Yes
Severity = 1 - Critical   AND   Work Item Type = Bug
Business Value 50
Area Path Under Fabrikam Fiber\Phone
Tags Contain RTM
Blocked = Yes
You can apply style rules to change the color of cards on boards and Taskboards.
From the board settings page, selectStylesto specify a style rule.

Select +Add styling rule. Select the color to apply to the card and define the criteria for the style rule.In the following example, we show theStylespage for the Dashboard.TipNote the following information about style rules:The criteria you specify works in a similar fashion as whenconstructing a query.All clauses are considered AND clauses, grouping clauses isn't supported.Card rules apply to all work items that meet the rule criteria.Rule color applies to work items based on the order in which rules are listed. If you add more than one style rule, make sure that you move them in the order of most importance. Drag them into the order you want them applied.You can quickly enable and disable a style rule.In the following example, we add aStale tasksrule, which highlights tasks that haven't changed in the last five days.

Enable or disable annotations
All applicable annotations for the selected board are enabled by default. These annotations include all work item types added to the next level backlog, GitHub, and Tests. Disable any unused annotations or ones that you want to restrict for a specific backlog level.
When you disable an annotation, you also disable the feature to add the associated object from the  board. For example, if you disable the Tests annotation, you disable the ability to add tests from the currently selected board.
Complete the following steps to manage annotations.
From your board settings page, selectAnnotations.
From your board settings page, selectAnnotations.
Check those annotations that you want enabled. For example, to enable tasks but disable tests, check the following boxes.NoteGitHub annotations requires Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1 or later version. For more information, seeLink GitHub commits, pull requests, branches, and issues to work items.

Configure inline tests
You can control the test plan where you create inline tests through your board. Choose to create a new test plan for each new test that you add or add all new tests to a selected test plan.
From the board settings page (product backlog only), chooseAnnotations.Make sure thatTestannotation is enabled, a requirement to configure inline tests.

SelectTests, and then choose the options you want. Choose an existing test plan from theactions icon results.TipIn a test plan, a test case can exist in multiple test suites. For example, you may define several test suites for each product feature and the test cases test scenarios across features. The test case might exist in both feature's test suite with the same configurations and test steps. Because of this setup, the tester might run the same test case multiple times for the same product version.
To avoid the redundancies that can occur under this scenario, you should chooseShow same outcome of the tests in multiple suites under the same plancheckbox. When checked, the Test Points of the same Test Case and configuration, shows the same latest outcome. When the tester runs any one test, the output is synced with all other test points (which are of the same Test Case work item and same configuration) in the Test Plans. The tester can use the outcome and choose not to run the test again.

Open the test plan, test suite from a card
From a card on the board, you can go to the underlying test plan and test suite under which the tests are created. Choose theopen icon to open another browser tab showingTestand associated test plan and test suite that controls the inline tests.

Reorder cards
You can drag any work item to any column or swimlane on a board. You can even change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.

In addition to the dynamic card reordering, you can also move a card to a specific column position.
Note
The last column, typically theClosedorDonecolumn, is always ordered byClosed Datewith the most recently closed items appearing towards the top of the column. In all other columns, cards are ordered by the backlog order or they're reordered based on the Card reordering setting selected.
Move a card to a specific column position
You can reorder the work items within a board column by choosing â¦Work items action menu, selectingMove to position, and then specifying a value in the dialog.
Note
TheMove to column positionfeature requires theNew Boards Hubfeature, which is enabled by default. For more information, seeManage or enable features.
Specify a value within the range listed, which corresponds to the number of items currently in the column.

Set the team preference for reordering cards
If you want to preserve the backlog priority when you move a card to a new column, you can change the board card reordering setting for your team.
Open your board. If you're not a team admin,get added as one. Only team and project admins can customize the board.
