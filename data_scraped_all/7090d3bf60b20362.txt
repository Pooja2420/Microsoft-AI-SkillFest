Get started with Azure Private Link by creating and using a private endpoint to connect securely to an Azure web app.
In this quickstart, create a private endpoint for an Azure App Services web app and then create and deploy a virtual machine (VM) to test the private connection.
You can create private endpoints for various Azure services, such as Azure SQL and Azure Storage.

Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have an Azure account,create an account for free.

Create a virtual network and an Azure Bastion host
The following procedure creates a virtual network with a resource subnet, an Azure Bastion subnet, and a Bastion host:
In the portal, search for and selectVirtual networks.

In theAzure Bastionsection, selectEnable Azure Bastion.Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses. The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Bastion?.NoteHourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Note
Virtual machines in a virtual network with a bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in bastion hosted virtual networks. For more information, seeDissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Test connectivity to the private endpoint
Use the virtual machine that you created earlier to connect to the web app across the private endpoint.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterVirtual machine. SelectVirtual machines.

Next steps
In this quickstart, you created:
A virtual network and bastion host
A virtual network and bastion host
A virtual machine
A virtual machine
A private endpoint for an Azure web app
A private endpoint for an Azure web app
You used the VM to test connectivity to the web app across the private endpoint.
