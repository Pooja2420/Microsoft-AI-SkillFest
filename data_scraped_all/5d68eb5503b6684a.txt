Azure Arc sites provide a centralized view to monitor  groups of resources, but don't provide monitoring capabilities for the site overall. Instead, customers can set up alerts and monitoring for supported resources within a site. Once alerts are set up and triggered depending on the alert criteria, Azure Arc site manager (preview) makes the resource alert status visible within the site pages.
