This article describes how to upgrade Windows Server OS while migrating to Azure. Azure Migrate OS upgrade allows you to move from an older operating system to a newer one while keeping your settings, server roles, and data intact. You can move your on-premisesâ¯server to Azure with an upgraded OS version of Windows Server using Windows upgrade.
Note
The upgrade feature only works for Windows Server Standard, Datacenter, and Enterprise editions.
The upgrade feature doesn't work for non en-US language servers.
This feature doesn't work for a Windows Server with an evaluation license and needs a full license. If you have any server with an evaluation license, upgrade to full edition before starting migration to Azure.
Prerequisites
Ensure you haveâ¯an existing Migrate project orcreatea project.
Ensure you have discovered the servers according to yourVMware,Hyper-V, orphysical serverenvironments and replicated the servers as described inMigrate VMware VMs,Migrate Hyper-V VMs, orMigrate Physical serversbased on your environment.
Verify the operating system disk has enoughâ¯free spaceto perform the in-place upgrade. The minimum disk space requirement is 32 GB.â¯
If you're upgrading from Windows Server 2008 or 2008 R2, ensure you have PowerShell 3.0 installed.
To upgrade from Windows Server 2008 or 2008 R2, ensure you have Microsoft .NET Framework 4 installed on your machine. This is available by default in Windows Server 2008 SP2 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
Disable antivirus and anti-spyware software and firewalls. These types of software can conflict with the upgrade process. Re-enable antivirus and anti-spyware software and firewalls after the upgrade is completed.
Ensure that your VM has the capability of adding another data disk as this feature requires the addition of an extra data disk temporarily for a seamless upgrade experience.â¯
For Private Endpoint enabled Azure Migrate projects, followthesesteps before initiating any Test migration/Migration with OS upgrade.
Note
In case of OS upgrade failure, Azure Migrate might download the Windows SetupDiag for error details. Ensure the VM created in Azure, post the migration has access toSetupDiag. In case there's no access to SetupDiag, you might not be able to get detailed OS upgrade failure error codes but the upgrade can still proceed.
Overview
The Windows OS upgrade capability helps you move from an older operating system to a newer one while keeping your settings, server roles, and data intact. Since both upgrade and migration operations are completed at once, this reduces duplicate planning, downtime, and test efforts. The upgrade capability also reduces the risk, as customers can first test their OS upgrade in an isolated environment in Azure using test migration without any impact on their on-premises server.â¯â¯â¯
You can upgrade to up to two versions from the current version.â¯â¯
Note
After you migrate and upgrade to Windows Server 2012 in Azure, you will get 3 years of free Extended Security Updates in Azure.Learn more.
Upgrade Windows OS during test migration
To upgrade Windows during the test migration, follow these steps:
Go toâ¯Servers, databases and web apps, selectReplicate.A Start Replication job begins. When the Start Replication job finishes successfully, the machines begin their initial replication to Azure.

After the migration job is successful, view the migrated Azure VM inâ¯Virtual Machinesâ¯in the Azure portal. The machine name has the suffixâ¯-Test.You can now use this server with upgraded OS to complete any application testing. The original server continues running on-premises without any impact while you test the newly upgraded server in an isolated environment.
