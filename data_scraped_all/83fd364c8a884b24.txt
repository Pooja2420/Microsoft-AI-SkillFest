Streaming units (SUs) represent the computing resources that are allocated to execute a Stream Analytics job. The higher the number of SUs, the more CPU and memory resources are allocated to your job. Stream Analytics offers two types of scaling, which allows you to have the right number ofStreaming Units(SUs) running to handle the load of your job.
This article explains how you can use these different scaling methods for your Stream Analytics job in the Azure portal.
The two types of scaling supported by Stream Analytics aremanual scaleandcustom autoscale.
Manual scaleallows you to maintain and adjust a fixed number of streaming units for your job.
Custom autoscaleallows you to specify the minimum and maximum number of streaming units for your job to dynamically adjust based on your rule definitions. Custom autoscale examines the preconfigured set of rules. Then it determines to add SUs to handle increases in load or to reduce the number of SUs when computing resources are sitting idle. For more information about autoscale in Azure Monitor, seeOverview of autoscale in Microsoft Azure.
Note
Although you can use manual scale regardless of the job's state, custom autoscale can only be enabled when the job is in therunningstate.
running
Examples of custom autoscale rules include:
Increase streaming units when the average SU% utilization of the job over the last 2 minutes goes above 75%.
Decrease streaming units when the average SU% utilization of the job over the last 15 minutes is below 30%.
Use more streaming units during business hours and fewer during off hours.
Autoscale limits
All Stream Analytics jobs can autoscale between 1/3, 2/3 and 1 SU V2. Autoscaling beyond 1 SU V2 requires your job to have a parallel orembarrassingly parallel topology. Parallel jobs created with less than or equal to 1 streaming unit can autoscale to the maximum SU value for that job based on the number of partitions.
Scaling your Stream Analytics job
First, follow these steps to navigate to theScalepage for your Azure Stream Analytics job.
Sign in toAzure portal
In the list of resources, find the Stream Analytics job that you want to scale and then open it.
In the job page, under theConfigureheading, selectScale.
UnderConfigure, you'll see two options for scaling:Manual scaleandCustom autoscale.
Manual scale
This setting allows you to set a fixed number of streaming units for your job. Notice that the default number of SUs is 1 when creating a job.
To manually scale your job
SelectManual scaleif it isn't already selected.
Use theSliderto set the SUs for the job or type directly into the box. You're limited to specific SU settings when the job is running. The limitation is dependent on your job configuration.
SelectSaveon the toolbar to save the setting.
Custom autoscale - default condition
You can configure automatic scaling of streaming units by using conditions. TheDefaultscale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions match. As such, you must select a Default condition for your job. You may choose a name for your Default condition or leave it asAuto created scale condition, which is pre-populated.
Auto created scale condition

Set theDefaultcondition by choosing one of the following scale modes:
Scale based on a metric(such as CPU or memory usage)
Scale to specific number of streaming units
Note
You can't set aSchedulewithin the Default condition. The Default is only executed when none of the other schedule conditions are met.
Scale based on a metric
The following procedure shows you how to add a condition to automatically increase streaming units (scale out) when the SU (memory) usage is greater than 75%. Or how to decrease streaming units (scale in) when the SU usage is less than 25%. Increments are made from fractional units (1/3 and 2/3) to a full streaming unit (1 SU V2). Similarly, decrements are made from 1 to 2/3 to 1/3.
On theScalepage, selectCustom autoscale.
In theDefaultsection of the page, specify anamefor the default condition. Select thepencilsymbol to edit the text.
SelectScale based on a metricforScale mode.
Select+ Add a rule.
On theScale rulepage, follow these steps:UnderMetric Namespace, select a metric from theMetric namedrop-down list. In this example, it'sSU % Utilization.Select an Operator and threshold values. In this example, they'reGreater thanand75forMetric threshold to trigger scale action.Select anoperationin theActionsection. In this example, it's set toIncrease.Then, selectAdd.
UnderMetric Namespace, select a metric from theMetric namedrop-down list. In this example, it'sSU % Utilization.

Select anoperationin theActionsection. In this example, it's set toIncrease.
Then, selectAdd.
Select+ Add a ruleagain, and follow these steps on theScale rulepage:Select a metric from theMetric namedrop-down list. In this example, it'sSU % Utilization.Select an operator and threshold values. In this example, they'reLess thanand25forMetric threshold to trigger scale action.Select anoperationin theActionsection. In this example, it's set toDecrease.Then, selectAdd.

Select anoperationin theActionsection. In this example, it's set toDecrease.
Then, selectAdd.
The autoscale feature decreases the streaming units for the namespace if the overall SU usage goes below 25% in this example.
Set theminimumandmaximumanddefaultnumber of streaming units. The minimum and maximum streaming units represent the scaling limitations for your job. Thedefaultvalue is used in the rare instance that scaling failed. We recommended that you set thedefaultvalue to the number of SUs that the job is currently running with.
SelectSave.
Note
Flapping refers to a loop condition that causes a series of opposing scale events. Flapping happens when a scale event triggers the opposite scale event. Refer tothisarticle which describes flapping in autoscale and how to avoid it.
Scale to specific number of streaming units
Follow these steps to configure the rule to scale the job to use specific number of streaming units. Again, the default condition is applied when none of the other scale conditions match.
On theScalepage, selectCustom autoscale.
In theDefaultsection of the page, specify anamefor the default condition.
SelectScale to specific streaming unitsforScale mode.
ForStreaming units, select the number of default streaming units.
Custom autoscale â Add more scale conditions
The previous section shows you how to add a default condition for the autoscale setting. This section shows you how to add more conditions to the autoscale setting. For these other non-default conditions, you can set a schedule based on specific days of the week or a date range.
Scale based on a metric
On theScalepage, selectCustom autoscalefor theChoose how to scale your resourceoption.
SelectAdd a scale conditionunder theDefaultblock.
Specify anamefor the condition.
Confirm that theScale based on a metricoption is selected.
Select+ Add a ruleto add a rule to increase streaming units when the overall SU % utilization goes above 75%. Follow steps from the precedingDefault conditionsection.
Set theminimumandmaximumanddefaultnumber of streaming units.
SetSchedule,Timezone,Start date, andEnd dateon the custom condition (but not on the default condition). You can either specify start and end dates for the condition (or) selectRepeat specific days(Monday, Tuesday, and so on.) of a week.If you selectSpecify start/end dates, select theTimezone,Start date and time, andEnd date and timefor the condition to be in effect.If you selectRepeat specific days, select the days of the week, timezone, start time, and end time when the condition should apply.
If you selectSpecify start/end dates, select theTimezone,Start date and time, andEnd date and timefor the condition to be in effect.
If you selectRepeat specific days, select the days of the week, timezone, start time, and end time when the condition should apply.
