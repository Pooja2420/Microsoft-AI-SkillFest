Learn how volume quotas work and learn how to monitor and manage the capacity of a volume or capacity pool in Azure NetApp Files.
Behaviors of volume quota
The storage capacity of an Azure NetApp Files volume is limited to the set size (quota) of the volume.

When volume consumption maxes out, neither the volume nor the underlying capacity pool grows automatically. Instead, the volume will receive an "out of space" condition. However, you canresize the capacity pool or a volumeas needed. You should activelymonitor the capacity of a volumeand the underlying capacity pool.

Depending on the capacity pool type, the size (quota) of an Azure NetApp Files volume has an impact on its bandwidth performance and the provisioned capacity.  See theauto QoS pool typefor details.
