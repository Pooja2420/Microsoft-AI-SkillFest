Azure Data Explorer enables you to control access to resources in your cluster using a role-based access control model. Under this model,principalsâusers, groups, and appsâare mapped tosecurity roles. Principals are granted access to cluster resources according to the roles they're assigned.
This article describes the available cluster level roles and how to assign principals to those roles using the Azure portal.
Note
