Migrate an Oracle database to Azure
This article describes considerations and recommendations that you can use to migrate on-premises Oracle Database workloads to Azure. This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of Oracle Database technologies and Azure networking. This guidance covers the following scenarios:
Physical migration of Oracle databases to Azure Virtual Machines
Physical migration of Oracle databases to Oracle Database@Azure (OD@A) Exadata Database Service
Architecture
The following diagram shows an example of this scenario.

Scenario
Consider the following initial scenario details:
You have one or more Oracle databases that run in your on-premises datacenter. You want to migrate the databases to Azure.
You have one or more Oracle databases that run in your on-premises datacenter. You want to migrate the databases to Azure.
The databases run on Oracle Database 19c, Enterprise Edition.
The databases run on Oracle Database 19c, Enterprise Edition.
The databases are Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)-enabled. For disaster recovery, you replicate the databases via Oracle Data Guard to another datacenter that's geographically distant from the primary database location.

You need to migrate the databases to Azure with the minimum amount of downtime.

You established network connectivity to Azure through Azure ExpressRoute, and you use a hub-and-spoke network topology in Azure.

In the hub virtual network, the traffic has to traverse a non-Microsoft network virtual appliance (NVA), such as FortiGate, Check Point, or Cisco. The NVA functions as a routing device, which helps ensure that traffic to and from Azure undergoes traffic inspection and is also fully routable.
