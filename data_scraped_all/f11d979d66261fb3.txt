Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server now helps you save money by prepaying for compute resources compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server reserved instances, you make an upfront commitment on Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server for a one or three year period to get a significant discount on the compute costs. To purchase Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server reserved capacity, you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.
How does the instance reservation work?
You don't need to assign the reservation to specific Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instances. An already running Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance or ones that are newly deployed automatically get the benefit of reserved pricing. By purchasing a reservation, you're pre-paying for the compute costs for one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server compute charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. A reservation doesn't cover software, networking, or storage charges associated with Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires, and Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server is billed at the pay-as-you go price. Reservations don't auto-renew. For pricing information, see theAzure Database for MySQL Flexible Server reserved capacity offering.

Reservation discount
You might save up to 67% on compute costs with reserved instances. In order to find the discount for your case, visit theReservation page on the Azure portaland check the savings per pricing tier and per region. Reserved instances help you manage your workloads, budget, and forecast better with an upfront payment for a one-year or three-year term. You can also exchange or cancel reservations as business needs change.
Determine the right database size before purchase
The size of reservation should be based on the total amount of compute used by the existing or soon-to-be-deployed server within a specific region and using the same performance tier and hardware generation.
For example, let's suppose that you're running one general purpose, Gen5 â 32 vCore Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server database, and two memory optimized, Gen5 â 16 vCore Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server databases. Further, let's supposed that you plan to deploy within the next month an additional general purpose, Gen5 â 32 vCore database server, and one memory optimized, Gen5 â 16 vCore database server. Let's suppose that you know that you need these resources for at least 1 year. In this case, you should purchase a 64 (2x32) vCores, 1 year reservation for single database general purpose - Gen5 and a 48 (2x16 + 16) vCore 1 year reservation for single database memory optimized - Gen5.
