This article describes the roles required to create and manage Azure Data Factory resources, and the permissions granted by the Data Factory Contributor role.
Roles and requirements
Most roles needed for Azure Data Factory are some of the standard Azure roles, though there is one special Azure Data Factory role:Data Factory Contributor
To create Data Factory instances, the user account that you use to sign in to Azure must be a member of thecontributorrole, theownerrole, or anadministratorof the Azure subscription. To view the permissions that you have in the subscription, in the Azure portal, select your username in the upper-right corner, and then selectMy permissions. If you have access to multiple subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription.
To create and manage child resources for Data Factory- including datasets, linked services, pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes - the following requirements are applicable:
To create and manage child resources in the Azure portal, you must belong to theData Factory Contributorrole at theResource Grouplevel or above.NoteIf you already assigned theContributorrole at theResource Grouplevel or above, you do not need theData Factory Contributorrole. TheContributor roleis a superset role that includes all permissions granted to theData Factory Contributor role.

Note
If you already assigned theContributorrole at theResource Grouplevel or above, you do not need theData Factory Contributorrole. TheContributor roleis a superset role that includes all permissions granted to theData Factory Contributor role.
To create and manage child resources with PowerShell or the SDK, thecontributorrole at the resource level or above is sufficient.

Set up permissions
After you create a Data Factory, you may want to let other users work with the data factory. To give this access to other users, you have to add them to the built-inData Factory Contributorrole on theResource Groupthat contains the Data Factory.
Scope of the Data Factory Contributor role
Membership of theData Factory Contributorrole lets users do the following things:
Create, edit, and delete data factories and child resources including datasets, linked services, pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes.
Deploy Resource Manager templates. Resource Manager deployment is the deployment method used by Data Factory in the Azure portal.
Manage App Insights alerts for a data factory.
Create support tickets.
For more info about this role, seeData Factory Contributor role.
Resource Manager template deployment
TheData Factory Contributorrole, at the resource group level or above, lets users deploy Resource Manager templates. As a result, members of the role can use Resource Manager templates to deploy both data factories and their child resources, including datasets, linked services, pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes. Membership in this role does not let the user create other resources.
Permissions on Azure Repos and GitHub are independent of Data Factory permissions. As a result, a user with repo permissions who is only a member of the Reader role can edit Data Factory child resources and commit changes to the repo, but can't publish these changes.
Important
Resource Manager template deployment with theData Factory Contributorrole does not elevate your permissions. For example, if you deploy a template that creates an Azure virtual machine, and you don't have permission to create virtual machines, the deployment fails with an authorization error.
In publish context,Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/writepermission applies to following modes.
That permission is only required in Live mode when the customer modifies the global parameters.
That permission is always required in Git mode since every time after the customer publishes, the factory object with the last commit ID needs to be updated.
Custom scenarios and custom roles
Sometimes you may need to grant different access levels for different data factory users. For example:
You may need a group where users only have permissions on a specific data factory.
Or you may need a group where users can only monitor a data factory (or factories) but can't modify it.
You can achieve these custom scenarios by creating custom roles and assigning users to those roles. For more info about custom roles, seeCustom roles in Azure.
Here are a few examples that demonstrate what you can achieve with custom roles:
Let a user create, edit, or delete any data factory in a resource group from the Azure portal.Assign the built-inData Factory contributorrole at the resource group level for the user. If you want to allow  access to any data factory in a subscription, assign the role at the subscription level.
Let a user create, edit, or delete any data factory in a resource group from the Azure portal.
Assign the built-inData Factory contributorrole at the resource group level for the user. If you want to allow  access to any data factory in a subscription, assign the role at the subscription level.
Let a user view (read) and monitor a data factory, but not edit or change it.Assign the built-inreaderrole on the data factory resource for the user.
