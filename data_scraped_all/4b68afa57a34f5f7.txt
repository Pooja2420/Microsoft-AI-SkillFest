In this tutorial, you'll learn how to analyze data with serverless SQL pool.
The Built-in serverless SQL pool
Serverless SQL pools let you use SQL without having to reserve capacity. Billing for a serverless SQL pool is based on the amount of data processed to run the query and not the number of nodes used to run the query.
Every workspace comes with a preconfigured serverless SQL pool calledBuilt-in.

Data exploration is just a simplified scenario where you can understand the basic characteristics of your data. Learn more about data exploration and analysis in thistutorial.
Create data exploration database
You can browse the content of the files directly viamasterdatabase. For some simple data exploration scenarios, you don't need to create a separate database.
However, as you continue data exploration, you might want to create some utility objects, such as:
master
External data sources that represent the named references for storage accounts.
Database scoped credentials that enable you to specify how to authenticate to external data source.
Database users with the permissions to access some data sources or database objects.
Utility views, procedures, and functions that you can use in the queries.
Use themasterdatabase to create a separate database for custom database objects. Custom database objects can't be created in themasterdatabase.CREATE DATABASE DataExplorationDB 
                COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8ImportantUse a collation with_UTF8suffix to ensure that UTF-8 text is properly converted toVARCHARcolumns.Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8provides the best performance in the queries that read data from Parquet files and Azure Cosmos DB containers. For more information on changing collations, seeCollation types supported for Synapse SQL.

FromDataExplorationDBcreate utility objects such as credentials and data sources.CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE ContosoLake
WITH ( LOCATION = 'https://contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net')NoteAn external data source can be created without a credential. If a credential does not exist, the caller's identity will be used to access the external data source.

An external data source can be created without a credential. If a credential does not exist, the caller's identity will be used to access the external data source.
Optionally, use the newly createdDataExplorationDBdatabase to create a login for a user inDataExplorationDBthat will access external data:CREATE LOGIN data_explorer WITH PASSWORD = 'My Very Strong Password 1234!';Next create a database user inDataExplorationDBfor the above login and grant theADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONSpermission.CREATE USER data_explorer FOR LOGIN data_explorer;
GO
GRANT ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS TO data_explorer;

            DATA_SOURCE = 'ContosoLake',

Data exploration database is just a simple placeholder where you can store your utility objects. Synapse SQL pool enables you to do much more and create a Logical Data Warehouse - a relational layer built on top of Azure data sources.
