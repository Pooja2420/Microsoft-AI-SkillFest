Azure Pipelines
Improved error message when failing to load pipelines
Azure Pipelines provides several types of triggers to configure how your pipeline starts. One way to run a pipeline is by using scheduled triggers. Sometimes, the Scheduled Run information of a pipeline gets corrupted and can cause a load to fail. Previously, we were displaying a misleading error message, claiming that the pipeline was not found. With this update, we resolved this issue and are returning an informative error message. Going forward you will received the message similar to:Build schedule data is corruptedif a pipeline fails to load.
General availability of Ubuntu 22.04 for Azure Pipelines hosted pools
The Ubuntu 22.04 image is now generally available for Azure Pipelines hosted agents. To use this image, update your YAML file to includevmImage:'ubuntu-22.04':
vmImage:'ubuntu-22.04'
- job: ubuntu2204
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-22.04'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from Ubuntu 22.04
      lsb_release -d
- job: ubuntu2204
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-22.04'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from Ubuntu 22.04
      lsb_release -d
Please note, the ubuntu-latest image label will continue to point to ubuntu-20.04.
Announcing deprecation of Ubuntu 18.04 images (updated)
Azure Pipelines is deprecating the Ubuntu 18.04 image (ubuntu-18.04) on our hosted pools. This image will be retired December 1st. You may start to see longer queue times.
ubuntu-18.04
There are several ways you can identify which pipelines are using the ubuntu-18.04 image, including:
Starting soon, warning messages will be displayed in pipeline runs using the ubuntu-18.04 image.
Thisscriptcan be run to help you find pipelines using deprecated images, including ubuntu-18.04.
We are scheduling short "brownouts". Any ubuntu-18.04 runs will fail during the brownout period. Therefore, it is recommended to migrate your pipelines prior to the brownouts.
