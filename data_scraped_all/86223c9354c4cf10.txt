You can use LDAP over TLS to secure communication between an Azure NetApp Files volume and the Active Directory LDAP server.  You can enable LDAP over TLS for NFS, SMB, and dual-protocol volumes of Azure NetApp Files.
Considerations
DNS PTR records must exist for each AD DS domain controller assigned to theAD Site Namespecified in the Azure NetApp Files Active Directory connection.
PTR records must exist for all domain controllers in the site for AD DS LDAP over TLS to function properly.
Generate and export root CA certificate
If you do not have a root CA certificate, you need to generate one and export it for use with LDAP over TLS authentication.

Enable LDAP over TLS and upload root CA certificate
Go to the NetApp account used for the volume, and selectActive Directory connections. Then, selectJointo create a new AD connection orEditto edit an existing AD connection.

In theJoin Active DirectoryorEdit Active Directorywindow that appears, select theLDAP over TLScheckbox to enable LDAP over TLS for the volume. Then selectServer root CA Certificateand upload thegenerated root CA certificateto use for LDAP over TLS.Ensure that the certificate authority name can be resolved by DNS. This name is the "Issued By" or "Issuer" field on the certificate:

If you uploaded an invalid certificate, and you have existing AD configurations, SMB volumes, or Kerberos volumes, an error similar to the following occurs:
Unable to validate the LDAP client configuration from LDAP server, please check connectivity or LDAP settings under AD connection.
Unable to validate the LDAP client configuration from LDAP server, please check connectivity or LDAP settings under AD connection.
To resolve the error condition, upload a valid root CA certificate to your NetApp account as required by the Windows Active Directory LDAP server for LDAP authentication.
Disable LDAP over TLS
Disabling LDAP over TLS stops encrypting LDAP queries to Active Directory (LDAP server). There are no other precautions or impact on existing ANF volumes.
Go to the NetApp account that is used for the volume and selectActive Directory connections. Then selectEditto edit the existing AD connection.
