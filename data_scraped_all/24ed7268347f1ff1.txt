This guide teaches you to migrate your Oracle schemas to Azure SQL Managed Instance by using SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle.
For other migration guides, seeAzure Database Migration Guides.
Prerequisites
Before you begin migrating your Oracle schema to SQL Managed Instance:
Verify your source environment is supported.
DownloadSSMA for Oracle.
Have aSQL Managed Instancetarget.
Obtain thenecessary permissions for SSMA for Oracleandprovider.
Pre-migration
After you've met the prerequisites, you're ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of your migration. This part of the process involves conducting an inventory of the databases that you need to migrate, assessing those databases for potential migration issues or blockers, and then resolving any items you might have uncovered.
Assess
By using SSMA for Oracle, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Managed Instance, and then finally migrate data to the database.
To create an assessment:
OpenSSMA for Oracle.

SelectFile, and then selectNew Project.

Enter a project name and a location to save your project. Then selectAzure SQL Managed Instanceas the migration target from the drop-down list and selectOK.

SelectConnect to Oracle. Enter values for Oracle connection details in theConnect to Oracledialog box.

Select the Oracle schemas you want to migrate.

InOracle Metadata Explorer, right-click the Oracle schema you want to migrate and then selectCreate Reportto generate an HTML report. Instead, you can select a database and then select theCreate Reporttab.

Review the HTML report to understand conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Oracle objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects.For example, seedrive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyOracleMigration\report\report_2020_11_12T02_47_55\.

Validate the data types
Validate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements if necessary. To do so, follow these steps:
In SSMA for Oracle, selectTools, and then selectProject Settings.

Convert the schema
To convert the schema:
(Optional) Add dynamic or ad hoc queries to statements. Right-click the node, and then selectAdd statements.

Save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. On theFilemenu, selectSave Project. This step gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you publish the schema to SQL Managed Instance.

Migrate
After you've completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to run the migration process. Migration involves two steps: publishing the schema and migrating the data.
To publish your schema and migrate your data:
Publish the schema by right-clicking the database from theDatabasesnode inAzure SQL Managed Instance Metadata Explorerand selectingSynchronize with Database.

Migrate the data by right-clicking the schema or object you want to migrate inOracle Metadata Explorerand selectingMigrate Data. Or, you can select theMigrate Datatab. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expandTables, and then select the checkboxes next to the tables. To omit data from individual tables, clear the checkboxes.

Post-migration
After you've successfully completed themigrationstage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
Remediate applications
After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this step will require changes to the applications in some cases.
Perform tests
The test approach to database migration consists of the following activities:
Develop validation tests: To test the database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you've defined.
Set up a test environment: The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.
Run validation tests: Run validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.
Run performance tests: Run performance tests against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.
Validate migrated objects
Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle Tester (SSMA Tester) allows you to test migrated database objects. The SSMA Tester is used to verify that converted objects behave in the same way.

Optimize
The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues, verifying completeness, and addressing performance issues with the workload.
Note
For more information about these issues and the steps to mitigate them, see thePost-migration validation and optimization guide.
