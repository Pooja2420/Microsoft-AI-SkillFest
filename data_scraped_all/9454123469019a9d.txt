In this article, you learn how to secure inferencing environments (online endpoints) with a virtual network in Azure Machine Learning. There are two inference options that can be secured using a VNet:
Azure Machine Learning managed online endpointsTipMicrosoft recommends using an Azure Machine Learningmanaged virtual networksinstead of the steps in this article when securing managed online endpoints. With a managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning handles the job of network isolation for your workspace and managed computes. You can also add private endpoints for resources needed by the workspace, such as Azure Storage Account. For more information, seeWorkspace managed network isolation.

Prerequisites
Read theNetwork security overviewarticle to understand common virtual network scenarios and overall virtual network architecture.

To deploy resources into a virtual network or subnet, your user account must have permissions to the following actions in Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC):"Microsoft.Network/*/read" on the virtual network resource. This permission isn't needed for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deployments."Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/join/action" on the virtual network resource."Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action" on the subnet resource.For more information on Azure RBAC with networking, see theNetworking built-in roles

If using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you must have an existing AKS cluster secured as described in theSecure Azure Kubernetes Service inference environmentarticle.

Secure Azure Kubernetes Service online endpoints
To use Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for secure inference, use the following steps:
Create or configure asecure Kubernetes inferencing environment.

Model deployment with Kubernetes online endpoint can be done using CLI v2, Python SDK v2 and Studio UI.CLI v2 -https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/endpoints/online/kubernetesPython SDK V2 -https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/kubernetesStudio UI - Follow the steps inmanaged online endpoint deploymentthrough the Studio. After you enter theEndpoint name, selectKubernetesas the compute type instead ofManaged.

Limit outbound connectivity from the virtual network
If you don't want to use the default outbound rules and you do want to limit the outbound access of your virtual network, you must allow access to Azure Container Registry. For example, make sure that your Network Security Groups (NSG) contains a rule that allows access to theAzureContainerRegistry.RegionNameservice tag where `{RegionName} is the name of an Azure region.
