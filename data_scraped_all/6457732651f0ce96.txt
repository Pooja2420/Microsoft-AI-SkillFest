Create an SMB volume for Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files supports creating volumes using NFS (NFSv3 or NFSv4.1), SMB3, or dual protocol (NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB). A volume's capacity consumption counts against its pool's provisioned capacity.
This article shows you how to create an SMB3 volume. For NFS volumes, seeCreate an NFS volume. For dual-protocol volumes, seeCreate a dual-protocol volume.
Important
Windows Server 2025 currently doesn't work with the Azure NetApp Files SMB protocol.
Before you begin
Important
If you're using a custom RBAC/IAM role, you must have theMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/readpermission configured to create or update a volume.
Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read
For more information about permissions and to confirm permissions configuration, seeCreate or update Azure custom roles using the Azure portal.
You must have already set up a capacity pool. SeeCreate a capacity pool.
A subnet must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files. SeeDelegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files.
Configure Active Directory connections
Before creating an SMB volume, you need to create an Active Directory connection. If you haven't configured Active Directory connections for Azure NetApp files, follow instructions described inCreate and manage Active Directory connections.
Add an SMB volume
Select theVolumesblade from the Capacity Pools blade.
Select theVolumesblade from the Capacity Pools blade.

Select+ Add volumeto create a volume.The Create a Volume window appears.
Select+ Add volumeto create a volume.The Create a Volume window appears.
In the Create a Volume window, selectCreateand provide information for the following fields under the Basics tab:Volume nameSpecify the name for the volume that you are creating.Refer toNaming rules and restrictions for Azure resourcesfor naming conventions on volumes. Additionally, you cannot usedefaultorbinas the volume name.Capacity poolSpecify the capacity pool where you want the volume to be created.QuotaSpecify the amount of logical storage that is allocated to the volume.TheAvailable quotafield shows the amount of unused space in the chosen capacity pool that you can use towards creating a new volume. The size of the new volume must not exceed the available quota.Large VolumeRegular volumes quotas are between 50 GiB and 100 TiB. Large volume quotas range from 50 TiB to 1 PiB in size. If you intend for the volume quota to fall in the large volume range, selectYes. Volume quotas are entered in GiB.ImportantIf this is your first time using large volumes, you must firstregister the featureand requestan increase in regional capacity quota.Regular volumes cannot be converted to large volumes. Large volumes can't be resized to less than 50 TiB. To understand the requirements and considerations of large volumes, seeRequirements and considerations for large volumes. For other limits, seeResource limits.Throughput (MiB/S)If the volume is created in a manual QoS capacity pool, specify the throughput you want for the volume.If the volume is created in an auto QoS capacity pool, the value displayed in this field is (quota x service level throughput).Enable Cool Access,Coolness Period, andCool Access Retrieval PolicyThese fields configureAzure NetApp Files storage with cool access. For descriptions, seeManage Azure NetApp Files storage with cool access.Virtual networkSpecify the Azure virtual network (VNet) from which you want to access the volume.The VNet you specify must have a subnet delegated to Azure NetApp Files. The Azure NetApp Files service can be accessed only from the same VNet or from a VNet that is in the same region as the volume through VNet peering. You can also access the volume from  your on-premises network through Express Route.SubnetSpecify the subnet that you want to use for the volume.The subnet you specify must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files.If you haven't delegated a subnet, you can selectCreate newon the Create a Volume page. Then in the Create Subnet page, specify the subnet information, and selectMicrosoft.NetApp/volumesto delegate the subnet for Azure NetApp Files. In each VNet, only one subnet can be delegated to Azure NetApp Files.Network featuresIn supported regions, you can specify whether you want to useBasicorStandardnetwork features for the volume.

Select an availability zone where Azure NetApp Files resources are present. For details, seeManage availability zone volume placement.If you want to apply an existing snapshot policy to the volume, selectShow advanced sectionto expand it, specify whether you want to hide the snapshot path, and select a snapshot policy in the pull-down menu.For information about creating a snapshot policy, seeManage snapshot policies.

Control access to an SMB volume
Access to an SMB volume is managed through permissions.
NTFS file and folder permissions
You can set permissions for a file or folder by using theSecuritytab of the object's properties in the Windows SMB client.

Modify SMB share permissions
You can modify SMB share permissions using Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
Important
Modifying SMB share permissions poses a risk. If the users or groups assigned to the share properties are removed from the Active Directory, or if the permissions for the share become unusable, then the entire share will become inaccessible.
To open Computer Management MMC on any Windows server, in the Control Panel, selectAdministrative Tools > Computer Management.
SelectAction > Connect to another computer.
In theSelect Computerdialog box, enter the name of the Azure NetApp Files FQDN or IP address or selectBrowseto locate the storage system.
SelectOKto connect the MMC to the remote server.
When the MMC connects to the remote server, in the navigation pane, selectShared Folders > Shares.
In the display pane that lists the shares, double-click a share to display its properties. In thePropertiesdialog box, modify the properties as needed.
