This service has the following dimensions associated with its metrics.
ServerOtherError: All other server-side errors except described ones.
ServerBusyError: Authenticated request that returned an HTTP 503 status code.
ServerTimeoutError: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code. The timeout occurred due to a server error.
AuthenticationError: The request couldn't be authenticated by the server.
AuthorizationError: Authenticated request that failed due to unauthorized access of data or an authorization failure.
NetworkError: Authenticated request that failed due to network errors. Most commonly occurs when a client prematurely closes a connection before timeout expiration.
ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError: The request is throttled on bandwidth for exceedingstorage account scalability limits.
ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError: The request is throttled on request rate for exceedingstorage account scalability limits.
ClientThrottlingError: Other client-side throttling error.ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingErrorandClientAccountRequestThrottlingErrorare excluded.
ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError
ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError
ClientShareEgressThrottlingError: Applicable to premium file shares only. Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to egress bandwidth throttling for exceeding share limits.ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingErroris excluded.
ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError
ClientShareIngressThrottlingError: Applicable to premium file shares only. Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to ingress bandwidth throttling for exceeding share limits.ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingErroris excluded.
ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError
ClientShareIopsThrottlingError: Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to IOPS throttling.ClientAccountRequestThrottlingErroris excluded.
ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError
ClientTimeoutError: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code. If the client's network timeout or the request timeout is set to a lower value than expected by the storage service, it's an expected timeout. Otherwise, it's reported as aServerTimeoutError.
ServerTimeoutError
ClientOtherError: All other client-side errors except described ones.
Success: Successful request
SuccessWithThrottling: Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.
SuccessWithShareEgressThrottling: Applicable to premium file shares only. Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled due to egress bandwidth throttling in the first attempt or attempts, but succeeds after retries.
SuccessWithShareIngressThrottling: Applicable to premium file shares only. Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled due to ingress bandwidth throttling in the first attempt or attempts, but succeeds after retries.
SuccessWithShareIopsThrottling: Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled due to IOPS throttling in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.
SuccessWithMetadataWarning: Applicable to file shares only. Successful request when a client runs high metadata IOPS, which may cause throttling later if the IOPS remain high or increase.
SuccessWithMetadataThrottling: Applicable to file shares only. Successful request when a client gets throttled due to high metadata IOPS in the first attempt or attempts, but succeeds after retries.
ResponseType
AccountKey: The transaction is authenticated with storage account key.
SAS: The transaction is authenticated with service/account shared access signatures.
DelegationSas: The transaction is authenticated with user-delegation SAS.
