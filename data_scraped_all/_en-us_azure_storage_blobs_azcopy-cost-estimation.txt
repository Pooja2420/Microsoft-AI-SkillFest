This article helps you estimate the cost to transfer blobs by using AzCopy.
All calculations are based on a fictitious price. You can find each price in thesample pricessection at the end of this article.
Important
These prices are meant only as examples, and shouldn't be used to calculate your costs. For official prices, see theAzure Blob Storage pricingorAzure Data Lake Storage pricingpricing pages. For more information about how to choose the correct pricing page, seeUnderstand the full billing model for Azure Blob Storage.
The cost to upload
When you run theazcopy copycommand, you'll specify a destination endpoint. That endpoint can be either a Blob Service endpoint (blob.core.windows.net) or a Data Lake Storage endpoint (dfs.core.windows.net) endpoint. This section calculates the cost of using each endpoint to upload1,000blobs that are5 GiBeach in size.

dfs.core.windows.net
Cost of uploading to the Blob Service endpoint
If you upload data to the Blob Service endpoint, then by default, AzCopy uploads each blob in 8-MiB blocks. This size is configurable.
AzCopy uses thePut Blockoperation to upload each block. After the final block is uploaded, AzCopy commits those blocks by using thePut Block Listoperation. Both operations are billed aswriteoperations.
The following table calculates the number of write operations required to upload these blobs.
Tip
You can reduce the number of operations by configuring AzCopy to use a larger block size.
After each blob is uploaded, AzCopy uses theGet Blob Propertiesoperation as part of validating the upload. TheGet Blob Propertiesoperation is billed as anAll other operationsoperation.
Using theSample pricesthat appear in this article, the following table calculates the cost to upload these blobs.
Note
If you upload to the archive tier, eachPut Blockoperation is charged at the price of ahotwrite operation. EachPut Block Listoperation is charged the price of anarchivewrite operation.
Cost of uploading to the Data Lake Storage endpoint
If you upload data to the Data Lake Storage endpoint, then AzCopy uploads each blob in 4-MiB blocks. This value isn't configurable.
AzCopy uploads each block by using thePath - Updateoperation with the action parameter set toappend. After the final block is uploaded, AzCopy commits those blocks by using thePath - Updateoperation with the action parameter set toflush. Both operations are billed aswriteoperations.

The cost to download
When you run theazcopy copycommand,  you'll specify a source endpoint. That endpoint can be either a Blob Service endpoint (blob.core.windows.net) or a Data Lake Storage endpoint (dfs.core.windows.net) endpoint. This section calculates the cost of using each endpoint to download1,000blobs that are5 GiBeach in size.
blob.core.windows.net
dfs.core.windows.net
Cost of downloading from the Blob Service endpoint
If you download blobs from the Blob Service endpoint, AzCopy uses theList Blobsto enumerate blobs. AList Blobsis billed as aList and create containeroperation. OneList Blobsoperation returns up to 5,000 blobs. Therefore, in this example, only oneList Blobsoperation is required.
For each blob, AzCopy uses theGet Blob Propertiesoperation, and theGet Bloboperation. TheGet Blob Propertiesoperation is billed as anAll other operationsoperation and theGet Bloboperation is billed as areadoperation.
If you download blobs from the cool or cold tier, you're also charged a data retrieval per GiB downloaded.
Using theSample pricesthat appear in this article, the following table calculates the cost to download these blobs.
Note
This table excludes the archive tier because you can't download directly from that tier. SeeBlob rehydration from the archive tier.
Cost of downloading from the Data Lake Storage endpoint
If you download blobs from the Data Lake Storage endpoint, AzCopy uses theList Blobsto enumerate blobs. AList Blobsis billed as aList and create containeroperation. OneList Blobsoperation returns up to 5,000 blobs. Therefore, in this example, only oneList Blobsoperation is required.
For each blob, AzCopy uses theGet Blob Propertiesoperation which is billed as anAll other operationsoperation. AzCopy downloads each block (4 MiB in size) by using thePath - Readoperation. EachPath - Readcall is billed as areadoperation.
If you download blobs from the cool or cold tier, you're also charged a data retrieval per GiB downloaded.
The following table calculates the number of write operations required to upload the blobs.

The cost to copy between containers
When you run theazcopy copycommand, you'll specify a source and destination endpoint. These endpoints can be either a Blob Service endpoint (blob.core.windows.net) or a Data Lake Storage endpoint (dfs.core.windows.net) endpoint. This section calculates the cost to copy1,000blobs that are5 GiBeach in size.
blob.core.windows.net
dfs.core.windows.net
Note
Blobs in the archive tier can be copied only to an online tier. Because all of these examples assume the same tier for source and destination, the archive tier is excluded from these tables.
Cost of copying blobs within the same account
Regardless of which endpoint you specify (Blob Service or Data Lake Storage), AzCopy uses theList Blobsto enumerate blobs at the source location. AList Blobsis billed as aList and create containeroperation. OneList Blobsoperation returns up to 5,000 blobs. Therefore, in this example, only oneList Blobsoperation is required.
For each blob, AzCopy uses theGet Blob Propertiesoperation for both the source blob and the blob that is copied to the destination. TheGet Blob Propertiesoperation is billed as anAll other operationsoperation. AzCopy uses theCopy Bloboperation to copy blobs to another container which is billed as awriteoperation that is based on the destination tier.
Cost of copying blobs to another account in the same region
This scenario is identical to the previous one except that you're also billed for data retrieval and for read operation that is based on the source tier.
Cost of copying blobs to an account located in another region
This scenario is identical to the previous one except you're billed for network egress charges.
The cost to synchronize changes
When you run theazcopy synccommand, you'll specify a source and destination endpoint. These endpoints can be either a Blob Service endpoint (blob.core.windows.net) or a Data Lake Storage endpoint (dfs.core.windows.net) endpoint.
blob.core.windows.net
dfs.core.windows.net
Note
Blobs in the archive tier can be copied only to an online tier. Because all of these examples assume the same tier for source and destination, the archive tier is excluded from these tables.
Cost to synchronize a container with a local file system
If you want to keep a container updated with changes to a local file system, then AzCopy performs the exact same tasks as described in theCost of uploading to the Blob Service endpointsection in this article. Blobs are uploaded only if the last modified time of a local file is different than the last modified time of the blob in the container. Therefore, you're billedwritetransactions only for blobs that are uploaded.
If you want to keep a local file system updated with changes to a container, then AzCopy performs the exact same tasks as described in theCost of downloading from the Blob Service endpointsection of this article. Blobs are downloaded only If the last modified time of a local blob is different than the last modified time of the blob in the container. Therefore, you're billedreadtransactions only for blobs that are downloaded.
Cost to synchronize containers
If you want to keep two containers synchronized, then AzCopy performs the exact same tasks as described in theThe cost to copy between containerssection in this article. A blob is copied only if the last modified time of a blob in the source container is different than the last modified time of a blob in the destination container. Therefore, you're billedwriteandreadtransactions only for blobs that are copied.
Theazcopy synccommand uses theList Blobsoperation on both source and destination accounts when synchronizing containers that exist in separate accounts.
