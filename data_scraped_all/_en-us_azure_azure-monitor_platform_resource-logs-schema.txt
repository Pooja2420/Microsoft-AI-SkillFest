Note
Resource logs were previously known as diagnostic logs. The name was changed in October 2019 as the types of logs gathered by Azure Monitor shifted to include more than just the Azure resource.
This article used to list resource log categories that you can collect. That list is now atResource log categories.
Azure Monitor resource logsare logs emitted by Azure services that describe the operation of those services or resources. All resource logs available through Azure Monitor share a common top-level schema. Each service has the flexibility to emit unique properties for its own events.
A combination of the resource type (available in theresourceIdproperty) and the category uniquely identify a schema. This article describes the top-level schemas for resource logs and links to the schemata for each service.

Top-level common schema
Note
The schema described here is valid when resource logs are sent to Azure storage or to an event hub. When the logs are sent to a Log Analytics workspace, the column names may be different. SeeStandard columns in Azure Monitor Logsfor columns common to all tables in a Log Analytics workspace andAzure Monitor data referencefor a reference of different tables.

Service-specific schemas
The schema for resource logs varies depending on the resource and log category. The following list shows Azure services that make available resource logs and links to the service and category-specific schemas (where available). The list changes as new services are added. If you don't see what you need, feel free to open a GitHub issue on this article so we can update it.
