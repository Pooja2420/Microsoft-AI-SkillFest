Azure Policy provides built-in policy definitions that help you govern the deployment of AI models in Managed AI Services (MaaS) and Model-as-a-Platform (MaaP). You can use these policies to control what models your developers can deploy.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Permissions to create and assign policies. To create and assign policies, you must be anOwnerorResource Policy Contributorat the Azure subscription or resource group level.
Familiarity with Azure Policy. To learn more, seeWhat is Azure Policy?.
Enable the policy
From theAzure portal, selectPolicyfrom the left side of the page. You can also search forPolicyin the search bar at the top of the page.

In thePolicy Assignmentform, use the following values:Scope: Select the scope where you want to assign the policy. The scope can be a management group, subscription, or resource group.Policy definition: Select the ellipse (...) and search forAllowed models for AI model deployment. Select the policy definition from the list. For example,Allowed models for AI model deployment in MaaS and MaaP.Assignment name: Enter a unique name for the assignment.The rest of the fields can be left as their default values or you can customize as needed for your organization.

In theParameterstab, use the following fields:Allowed models: This field expects themodel ID strings, separated by commas. To get the model ID strings, use the following steps:Go to theAzure Machine Learning Model Catalogfor your workspace.NoteYou must have an Azure Machine Learning workspace to access the Model Catalog.For each model you want to allow, select the model to view the details. In the model detail information, copy theModel IDvalue. For example, the value might look likeazureml://registries/azure-openai/models/gpt-35-turbo/versions/3.ImportantThe model ID value must be an exact match for the model.

Notify your developers that the policy is in place. They receive an error message if they try to deploy a model that isn't in the list of allowed models.

Monitor compliance
To monitor compliance with the policy, follow these steps:
From theAzure portal, selectPolicyfrom the left side of the page. You can also search forPolicyin the search bar at the top of the page.
From the left side of the Azure Policy Dashboard, selectCompliance. Each policy assignment is listed with the compliance status. To view more details, select the policy assignment.
Update the policy assignment
To update an existing policy assignment with new models, follow these steps:
From theAzure portal, selectPolicyfrom the left side of the page. You can also search forPolicyin the search bar at the top of the page.
From the left side of the Azure Policy Dashboard, selectAssignmentsand find the existing policy assignment. Select the ellipsis (...) next to the assignment and selectEdit assignment.
From theParameterstab, update theAllowed modelsparameter with the new model IDs.
From theReview + Savetab, selectSaveto update the policy assignment.
Best practices
Granular scoping: Assign policies at the appropriate scope to balance control and flexibility. For example, apply at the subscription level to control all resources in the subscription, or apply at the resource group level to control resources in a specific group.
Policy naming: Use a consistent naming convention for policy assignments to make it easier to identify the purpose of the policy. Include information such as the purpose and scope in the name.
Documentation: Keep records of policy assignments and configurations for auditing purposes. Document any changes made to the policy over time.
Regular reviews: Periodically review policy assignments to ensure they align with your organization's requirements.
Testing: Test policies in a nonproduction environment before applying them to production resources.
Communication: Make sure developers are aware of the policies in place and understand the implications for their work.
