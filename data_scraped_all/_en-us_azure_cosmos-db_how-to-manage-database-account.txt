This article describes how to manage various tasks on an Azure Cosmos DB account by using the Azure portal. Azure Cosmos DB can also be managed with other Azure management clients includingAzure PowerShell,Azure CLI,Azure Resource Manager templates,Bicep, andTerraform.
Tip
The management API for Azure Cosmos DB orcontrol planeis not designed for high request volumes like the rest of the service. To learn more seeControl Plane Service Limits

Add/remove regions from your database account
Tip
When a new region is added, all data must be fully replicated and committed into the new region before the region is marked as available. The amount of time this operation takes depends upon how much data is stored within the account. If anasynchronous throughput scaling operationis in progress, the throughput scale-up operation is paused and resumes automatically when the add/remove region operation is complete.

Enable service-managed failover for your Azure Cosmos DB account
The Service-Managed failover option allows Azure Cosmos DB to fail over to the region with the highest failover priority with no user action should a region become unavailable. When service-managed failover is enabled, region priority can be modified. Your account must have two or more regions to enable service-managed failover.
From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open theReplicate data globallypane.

Perform forced failover for your Azure Cosmos DB Account
A forced failover (region offline) enables users to promptly address degraded performance, partial outages, or regional disruptions in a Cosmos DB account. A service-managed failover depends on the service's confirmation and which might take time to activate based on the progression of the outage. A forced failover allows administrators to quickly restore availability for the affected region without waiting for the service-managed failover.
From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open theReplicate data globallypane.

Review the warning message indicating the possibility of data loss due to un-replicated writes not being available in the region that will be promoted to the new write region based on the failover priority.
Select the region to be marked offline, check the box titled âI understand and agree to offline the currently selected region.â and click theOffline regionbutton.

Once completed, the region with the highest failover priority is promoted to the new write region, while the original write region is marked offline.The Azure Cosmos DB service team handles bringing back the region online. If the region is offline during an outage, it may take more than three days to restore it online, depending on the impact's severity. For a disaster recovery drill where a region is taken offline, please create a support ticket request to bring the region back online.In the case of a single-write region, if the write region is offline during the drill or an outage, bringing the region back online will restore it as a 'read region'. Afterward, you can perform the 'change write region' operation to promote the region back to a write region.Azure Cosmos DB offers âRegion Offlineâ and âRegion Onlineâ metrics for users who want to create automation based on these metrics. For instance, after the region is back online, you might want to trigger an automation job to change-write region. The list of supported database account metrics can be foundhere.

Set failover priorities for your Azure Cosmos DB account
After an Azure Cosmos DB account is configured for service-managed failover, the failover priority for regions can be changed.
Important
You can't modify the write region (failover priority of zero) when the account is configured for service-managed failover. To change the write region, you must disable service-managed failover and do a manual failover.
From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open theReplicate data globallypane.

Change write region for your Azure Cosmos DB Account
Important
The Azure Cosmos DB account must be configured with multiple regions for change write region operation.
Note
If you perform a manual change-write region operation while an asynchronous throughput scaling operation is in progress, the throughput scale-up operation will be paused. It resumes automatically when the failover operation is complete. For more information, seeBest practices for scaling provisioned throughput (RU/s)
Warning
In the event of a write region outage, please do not use change-write region. For outage scenarios, please refer to forced failover section.
Go to your Azure Cosmos DB account and open theReplicate data globallymenu.
