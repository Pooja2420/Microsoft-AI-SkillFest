Resource logging for a network security group
Article

In this article
A network security group (NSG) includes rules that allow or deny traffic to a virtual network subnet, network interface, or both.
When you enable logging for an NSG, you can gather the following types of resource log information:
Event: Entries are logged for which NSG rules are applied to virtual machines, based on a MAC address.
Rule counter: Contains entries for how many times each NSG rule is applied to allow or deny traffic. The status for these rules is collected every 300 seconds.
Resource logs are available only for NSGs deployed through the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. You can't enable resource logging for NSGs deployed through the classic deployment model. For more information, seeUnderstand deployment models.
Resource logging is enabled separately foreachNSG for which to collect diagnostic data. If you're interested inactivity, oroperational, logs instead, seeOverview of Azure platform logs. If you're interested in IP traffic flowing through NSGs, seeFlow logs for network security groups.

Azure PowerShell
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
You can run the commands that are available in this section inAzure Cloud Shell. You can also run PowerShell from your computer. Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.
If you run PowerShell from your computer, you need the Azure PowerShell module, version 1.0.0 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Azto find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module. If you run PowerShell locally, you also need to run theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet to sign in to Azure with an account that has thenecessary permissions.
Get-Module -ListAvailable Az
To enable resource logging, you need the ID of an existing NSG. If you don't have an existing NSG, create one by using theNew-AzNetworkSecurityGroupcmdlet.
Get the NSG for which you want to enable resource logging by using theGet-AzNetworkSecurityGroupcmdlet. Store the NSG in a variable for later use. For example, to retrieve an NSG namedmyNsgthat exists in a resource group namedmyResourceGroup, enter the following command:
myNsg
myResourceGroup
$Nsg=Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup `
  -Name myNsg `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$Nsg=Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup `
  -Name myNsg `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
You can write resource logs to different destination types. For more information, seeLog destinations. In this article, logs are sent to aLog Analytics workspacedestination. If you don't have an existing workspace, create one by using theNew-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspacecmdlet.
Retrieve an existing Log Analytics workspace with theGet-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspacecmdlet. For example, to get and store an existing workspace namedmyWorkspacein a resource group namedmyWorkspaces, enter the following command:
myWorkspace
myWorkspaces
$Oms=Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace `
  -ResourceGroupName myWorkspaces `
  -Name myWorkspace
$Oms=Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace `
  -ResourceGroupName myWorkspaces `
  -Name myWorkspace
There are two categories of logging that you can enable. For more information, seeLog categories. Enable resource logging for the NSG with theNew-AzDiagnosticSettingcmdlet. The following example logs both event and counter category data to the workspace for an NSG. It uses the IDs for the NSG and workspace that you got with the previous commands:
New-AzDiagnosticSetting `
   -Name myDiagnosticSetting `
   -ResourceId $Nsg.Id `
   -WorkspaceId $Oms.ResourceId
New-AzDiagnosticSetting `
   -Name myDiagnosticSetting `
   -ResourceId $Nsg.Id `
   -WorkspaceId $Oms.ResourceId
If you want to log to a differentdestinationthan a Log Analytics workspace, use an appropriate parameter in the command. For more information, seeAzure resource logs.
For more information about settings, seeNew-AzDiagnosticSetting.
View and analyze logs. For more information, seeView and analyze logs.
Azure CLI
You can run the commands in this section inCloud Shellor by running the Azure CLI from your computer. Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.
If you run the CLI from your computer, you need version 2.0.38 or later. Runaz --versionon your computer to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeInstall the Azure CLI. If you run the CLI locally, you also need to runaz loginto sign in to Azure with an account that has thenecessary permissions.
az --version
az login
To enable resource logging, you need the ID of an existing NSG. If you don't have an existing NSG, create one by usingaz network nsg create.
Get and store the NSG for which you want to enable resource logging withaz network nsg show. For example, to retrieve an NSG namedmyNsgthat exists in a resource group namedmyResourceGroup, enter the following command:
myNsg
myResourceGroup
nsgId=$(az network nsg show \
  --name myNsg \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --query id \
  --output tsv)
nsgId=$(az network nsg show \
  --name myNsg \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --query id \
  --output tsv)
You can write resource logs to different destination types. For more information, seeLog destinations. In this article, logs are sent to a Log Analytics workspace destination, as an example. For more information, seeLog categories.
Enable resource logging for the NSG withaz monitor diagnostic-settings create. The following example logs both event and counter category data to an existing workspace namedmyWorkspace, which exists in a resource group namedmyWorkspaces. It uses the ID of the NSG that you saved by using the previous command.
myWorkspace
myWorkspaces
az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
  --name myNsgDiagnostics \
  --resource $nsgId \
  --logs '[ { "category": "NetworkSecurityGroupEvent", "enabled": true, "retentionPolicy": { "days": 30, "enabled": true } }, { "category": "NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter", "enabled": true, "retentionPolicy": { "days": 30, "enabled": true } } ]' \
  --workspace myWorkspace \
  --resource-group myWorkspaces
az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
  --name myNsgDiagnostics \
  --resource $nsgId \
  --logs '[ { "category": "NetworkSecurityGroupEvent", "enabled": true, "retentionPolicy": { "days": 30, "enabled": true } }, { "category": "NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter", "enabled": true, "retentionPolicy": { "days": 30, "enabled": true } } ]' \
  --workspace myWorkspace \
  --resource-group myWorkspaces
If you don't have an existing workspace, create one by using theAzure portalorAzure PowerShell. There are two categories of logging for which you can enable logs.
If you only want to log data for one category or the other, remove the category you don't want to log data for in the previous command. If you want to log to a differentdestinationthan a Log Analytics workspace, use an appropriate parameter. For more information, seeAzure resource logs.
View and analyze logs. For more information, seeView and analyze logs.
Log destinations
You can send diagnostics data to the following options:
Log Analytics workspace
Azure Event Hubs
Azure Storage
Azure Monitor partner integrations
Log categories
JSON-formatted data is written for the following log categories: event and rule counter.
Event
The event log contains information about which NSG rules are applied to virtual machines, based on a MAC address. The following data is logged for each event. In the following example, the data is logged for a virtual machine with the IP address 192.168.1.4 and a MAC address of 00-0D-3A-92-6A-7C.

Note
The source IP address for the communication isn't logged. You can enableNSG flow loggingfor an NSG, which logs all of the rule counter information and the source IP address that initiated the communication. NSG flow log data is written to an Azure Storage account. You can analyze the data with thetraffic analyticscapability of Azure Network Watcher.
