Download detailed estimates for Azure Backup pricing
If you're looking to estimate your costs for budgeting or cost comparison purposes, download the detailedAzure Backup pricing estimator.
What does the estimator contain?
The Azure Backup cost estimator sheet has an option for you to estimate all possible workloads you're looking to back up using Azure Backup. These workloads include:
Azure VMs
On-premises servers
SQL in Azure VMs
SAP HANA in Azure VMs
Azure files shares
Estimate costs for backing up Azure VMs or on-premises servers
To estimate the costs of backing up Azure VMs or on-premises servers using Azure Backup, youâll need the following parameters:
Size of the VMs or on-premises servers that you're trying to back upEnter the âused sizeâ of disks or servers required to be backed up
Size of the VMs or on-premises servers that you're trying to back up
Enter the âused sizeâ of disks or servers required to be backed up
Number of servers with that size
Number of servers with that size
What is the expected amount of data churn on these servers?Churn refers to the amount of change in data. For example, if you had a VM with 200 GB of data to be backed up and 10 GB of it changes every day, the daily churn is 5%.Higher churn will mean that you back up more dataPickLoworModeratefor file servers andHighif you're running databasesIf you know yourchurn%, you can use theEnter your own%option

Optionalâ Selective Disk backupIf you're using theSelective Disk Backupoption while backing up Azure VMs, choose theExclude Diskoption and enter the percentage of disks excluded from backup in terms of size. For example, if you have a VM connected to three disks with 200 GB used in each disk and if you want to exclude two of them from backing up, enter 66.7%.

Optionalâ Backup Storage RedundancyThis indicates the redundancy of the Storage Account your backup data goes into. We recommend usingGRSfor the highest availability. Since it ensures that a copy of your backup data is kept in a different region, it helps you meet multiple compliance standards. Change the redundancy toLRSif you're backing up development or test environments that don't need an enterprise-level backup. Select theRAGRSoption in the sheet if you want to understand costs whenCross-Region Restoreis enabled for your backups.

Estimate costs for backing up SAP HANA servers in Azure VMs

Estimate costs for backing up Azure file shares
To estimate the costs of backing up Azure file shares using thesnapshot-based backup solutionoffered by Azure Backup, youâll need the following parameters:
Size (in GB) of the file shares that you want to back up.
Size (in GB) of the file shares that you want to back up.
If you want to back up file shares spread across multiple storage accounts, specify the number of storage accounts hosting the file shares with the above size.
If you want to back up file shares spread across multiple storage accounts, specify the number of storage accounts hosting the file shares with the above size.
Expected amount of data churn on the file shares that you want to back up.Churn refers to the amount of change in data and it directly impacts the snapshot storage size. For example, if you have a file share with 200 GB of data to be backed up, and 10 GB of it changes every day, the daily churn is 5%.Higher churn means the amount of data change in the file share contents every day is high, and so incremental snapshot (capturing only the data changes) size would also be more.Select Low (1%), Moderate (3%), or High (5%) based on your file share characteristics and usage.If you know the exactchurn%for your file share, you can select theEnter your own%option from the drop-down. Specify the values (in %) for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly churn.

Type of storage account (standard or premium) and the storage redundancy setting of the storage account hosting the backed-up file share.In the current backup solution for Azure file shares, snapshots are stored in the same storage account as the backed-up file share. So the storage cost associated with snapshots is billed as part of your Azure files bill, based on the snapshot pricing for the account type and redundancy setting of the storage account hosting the backed-up file share and snapshots.
