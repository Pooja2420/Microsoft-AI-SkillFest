Stream and filter data from Windows DNS servers with the AMA connector

This article describes how to use the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) connector to stream and filter events from your Windows Domain Name System (DNS) server logs. You can then deeply analyze your data to protect your DNS servers from threats and attacks. The AMA and its DNS extension are installed on your Windows Server to upload data from your DNS analytical logs to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
DNS is a widely used protocol, which maps between host names and computer readable IP addresses. Because DNS wasnât designed with security in mind, the service is highly targeted by malicious activity, making its logging an essential part of security monitoring. Some well-known threats that target DNS servers include DDoS attacks targeting DNS servers, DNS DDoS Amplification, DNS hijacking, and more.
While some mechanisms were introduced to improve the overall security of this protocol, DNS servers are still a highly targeted service. Organizations can monitor DNS logs to better understand network activity, and to identify suspicious behavior or attacks targeting resources within the network. TheWindows DNS Events via AMAconnector provides this type of visibility. For example, use the connector to identify clients that try to resolve malicious domain names, view and monitor request loads on DNS servers, or view dynamic DNS registration failures.
Note
The Windows DNS Events via AMA connector only supports analytical log events.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, verify that you have:
A Log Analytics workspace enabled for Microsoft Sentinel.
TheWindows DNS Events via AMAdata connector installed as part of theWindows Server DNSsolution from content hub.
Windows server 2016 and later supported, or Windows Server 2012 R2 with the auditing hotfix.
DNS server role installed withDNS-Serveranalytical event logs enabled.
DNS analytical event logs aren't enabled by default. For more information, seeEnable analytical event logging.
To collect events from any system that isn't an Azure virtual machine, ensure thatAzure Arcis installed. Install and enable Azure Arc before you enable the Azure Monitor Agent-based connector. This requirement includes:
Windows servers installed on physical machines
Windows servers installed on on-premises virtual machines
Windows servers installed on virtual machines in non-Azure clouds
Configure the Windows DNS over AMA connector via the portal
Use the portal setup option to configure the connector using a single Data Collection Rule (DCR) per workspace. Afterwards, use advanced filters to filter out specific events or information, uploading only the valuable data you want to monitor, reducing costs and bandwidth usage.
If you need to create multiple DCRs,use the APIinstead. Using the API to create multiple DCRs will still show only one DCR in the portal.
To configure the connector:
In Microsoft Sentinel, open theData connectorspage, and locate theWindows DNS Events via AMAconnector.
In Microsoft Sentinel, open theData connectorspage, and locate theWindows DNS Events via AMAconnector.
Towards the bottom of the side pane, selectOpen connector page.
Towards the bottom of the side pane, selectOpen connector page.
In theConfigurationarea, selectCreate data collection rule. You can create a single DCR per workspace.The DCR name, subscription, and resource group are automatically set based on the workspace name, the current subscription, and the resource group the connector was selected from. For example:

The DCR name, subscription, and resource group are automatically set based on the workspace name, the current subscription, and the resource group the connector was selected from. For example:

Select theResourcestab >Add Resource(s).
Select theResourcestab >Add Resource(s).
Select the VMs on which you want to install the connector to collect logs. For example:

Configure the Windows DNS over AMA connector via API
Use the API setup option to configure the connector using multipleDCRsper workspace. If you'd prefer to use a single DCR, use theportal optioninstead.
Using the API to create multiple DCRs still shows only one DCR in the portal.
Use the following example as a template to create or update a DCR:
Request URL and headerâ¯
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules/{dataCollectionRuleName}?api-version={latest-supported-version}
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules/{dataCollectionRuleName}?api-version={latest-supported-version}

Use advanced filters in your DCRs
DNS server event logs can contain a huge number of events. We recommend using advanced filtering to filter out unneeded events before the data is uploaded, saving valuable triage time and costs. The filters remove the unneeded data from the stream of events uploaded to your workspace, and are based on a combination of multiple fields.
For more information, seeAvailable fields for filtering.
Create advanced filters via the portal
Use the following procedure to create filters via the portal. For more information about creating filters with the API, seeAdvanced filtering examples.
To create filters via the portal:
On the connector page, in theConfigurationarea, selectAdd data collection filters.
On the connector page, in theConfigurationarea, selectAdd data collection filters.
Enter a name for the filter and select the filter type, which is a parameter that reduces the number of collected events. Parameters are normalized according to the DNS normalized schema. For more information, seeAvailable fields for filtering.

Select the values for which you want to filter the field from among the values listed in the drop-down.

To add complex filters, selectAdd exclude field to filterand add the relevant field.Use comma-separated lists to define multiple values for each field.To create compound filters, use different fields with an AND relation.To combine different filters, use an OR relation between them.Filters also support wildcards as follows:Add a dot after each asterisk (*.).Don't use spaces between the list of domains.Wildcards apply to the domain's subdomains only, includingwww.domain.com, regardless of the protocol. For example, if you use*.domain.comin an advanced filter:The filter applies towww.domain.comandsubdomain.domain.com, regardless of whether the protocol is HTTPS, FTP, and so on.The filter doesn't apply todomain.com. To apply a filter todomain.com, specify the domain directly, without using a wildcard.

Normalization using ASIM
This connector is fully normalized usingAdvanced Security Information Model (ASIM) parsers. The connector streams events originated from the analytical logs into the normalized table namedASimDnsActivityLogs. This table acts as a translator, using one unified language, shared across all DNS connectors to come.
ASimDnsActivityLogs
For a source-agnostic parser that unifies all DNS data and ensures that your analysis runs across all configured sources, use theASIM DNS unifying parser_Im_Dns.
_Im_Dns
The ASIM unifying parser complements the nativeâ¯ASimDnsActivityLogsâ¯table. While the native table is ASIM compliant, the parser is needed to add capabilities, such as aliases, available only at query time, and to combineASimDnsActivityLogsâ¯ with other DNS data sources.
ASimDnsActivityLogs
ASimDnsActivityLogs
TheASIM DNS schemarepresents the DNS protocol activity, as logged in the Windows DNS server in the analytical logs. The schema is governed by official parameter lists and RFCs that define fields and values.
See thelist of Windows DNS server fieldstranslated into the normalized field names.
