When you create a scale set, you define the number of VM instances that you wish to run. As your application demand changes, you can automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances. The ability to autoscale lets you keep up with customer demand or respond to application performance changes throughout the lifecycle of your app.
This article shows you how to create autoscale rules in the Azure portal that monitor the performance of the VM instances in your scale set. These autoscale rules increase or decrease the number of VM instances in response to these performance metrics. You can also complete these steps withAzure PowerShellor theAzure CLI.
Prerequisites
To create autoscale rules, you need an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set. You can create a scale set with theAzure portal,Azure PowerShell, orAzure CLI.
Create a rule to automatically scale out
If your application demand increases, the load on the VM instances in your scale set increases. If this increased load is consistent, rather than just a brief demand, you can configure autoscale rules to increase the number of VM instances in the scale set. When these VM instances are created and your applications are deployed, the scale set starts to distribute traffic to them through the load balancer. You control what metrics to monitor, such as CPU or disk, how long the application load must meet a given threshold, and how many VM instances to add to the scale set.

Let's create a rule that increases the number of VM instances in a scale set when the average CPU load is greater than 70% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is increased by 20%. In scale sets with a small number of VM instances, you could set theOperationtoIncrease count byand then specify1or2for theInstance count. In scale sets with a large number of VM instances, an increase of 10% or 20% VM instances may be more appropriate.Specify the following settings for your rule:ParameterExplanationValueTime AggregationDefines how the collected metrics should be aggregated for analysis.AverageMetric NameThe performance metric to monitor and apply scale set actions on.Percentage CPUTime grain statisticDefines how the collected metrics in each time grain should be aggregated for analysis.AverageOperatorOperator used to compare the metric data against the threshold.Greater thanThresholdThe percentage that causes the autoscale rule to trigger an action.70DurationThe amount of time monitored before the metric and threshold values are compared.

Create a rule to automatically scale in
On an evening or weekend, your application demand may decrease. If this decreased load is consistent over a period of time, you can configure autoscale rules to decrease the number of VM instances in the scale set. This scale-in action reduces the cost to run your scale set as you only run the number of instances required to meet the current demand.

Define autoscale instance limits
Your autoscale profile must define a minimum, maximum, and default number of VM instances. When your autoscale rules are applied, these instance limits make sure that you do not scale out beyond the maximum number of instances, or scale in beyond the minimum of instances.
Set the following instance limits:MinimumMaximumDefault2102
Set the following instance limits:

Monitor number of instances in a scale set
To see the number and status of VM instances, selectInstancesfrom the menu on the left-hand side of the scale set window. The status indicates if the VM instance isCreatingas the scale set automatically scales out, or isDeletingas the scale automatically scales in.

Autoscale based on a schedule
The previous examples automatically scaled a scale set in or out with basic host metrics such as CPU usage. You can also create autoscale rules based on schedules. These schedule-based rules allow you to automatically scale out the number of VM instances ahead of an anticipated increase in application demand, such as core work hours, and then automatically scale in the number of instances at a time that you anticipate less demand, such as the weekend.
