Custom rules provide support for a number of business use cases, allowing you to go beyond setting a default value for a field or make it required. Rules allow you to clear the value of a field, copy a value into a field, and apply values based on dependencies between different fields' values.
Important
The Inheritance process model is available for projects configured to support it. If youâre using an older collection, check the process model compatibility. If your on-premises collection is configured to use the on-premises XML process model, you can only use that process model to customize the work tracking experience. For more information, seeChoose the process model for your project collection.
With a custom rule, you can define a number of actions based on specific conditions. For example, you can apply a rule to support these types of scenarios:
When a value is defined for Priority, then make Risk a required field
When a change is made to the value of Release, then clear the value of "Milestone"
When a change was made to the value of Remaining Work, then make Completed Work a required field
When the value of Approved is True, then make Approved By a required field
When a user story is created, make the following fields required: Priority, Risk, and Effort
When current user is a member of "Project Administrators", then make Priority required
When current user is not a member of "Project Administrators", then hide the Priority field
Note
You make a field required and specify a field default through theOptionstab for the field.
Prior to defining a custom rule, reviewRules and rule evaluation, Inherited process rule composition. For examples that illustrate common scenarios for applying rules, seeSample rule scenarios.

Note
When you customize an inherited process, any projects using that process automatically reflect the customizations. To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend creating a test process and project, which allows you to test your customizations before you implement them organization-wide. For more information, seeCreate and manage inherited processes.
Add a custom rule
You add fields to a selected work item type.
Select the WIT to which you want to add a rule, chooseRules, and then chooseNew rule.If you can't fill out the New work item rule dialog, you don't have the necessary permissions to edit the process. SeeSet permissions and access for work tracking, Customize an inherited process.

Once you've added a custom rule, open a work item and verify that the rule works as you intended.

Delete or disable a rule
You can temporarily disable a rule or delete it altogether.
You delete or disable the rule from the actions menu of the rule.
