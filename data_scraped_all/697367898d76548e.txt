Before you begin, it's a good idea to read the overview page formachine configuration.
Machine configuration usesDesired State Configuration(DSC) when auditing and configuring
both Windows and Linux. The DSC configuration defines the condition that the machine should be in.
Important
Custom packages that audit the state of an environment and apply configurations are in Generally
Available (GA) support status. However, the following limitations apply:
To use machine configuration packages that apply configurations, Azure VM guest configuration
extension version 1.26.24 or later, or Arc agent 1.10.0 or later, is required.
TheGuestConfigurationmodule is only available on Ubuntu 18 and later. However, the package
and policies produced by the module can be used on any Linux distribution and version supported
in Azure or Arc.
Testing packages on macOS isn't available.
Don't use secrets or confidential information in custom content packages.
Use the following steps to develop your own configuration for managing the state of an Azure or
non-Azure machine.
Set up a machine configuration authoring environment
Create a custom machine configuration package artifact
Test the package artifact
Publish the package artifact
Provide access to a package
Sign the package artifact
The following video provides a step by step guide on how to author a custom machine configuration
policy using theGuestConfiguration PowerShell module.
