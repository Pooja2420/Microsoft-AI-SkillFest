This article describes how to back up and restore Windows or Linux Azure virtual machines (VMs) with encrypted disks using theAzure Backupservice. For more information, seeEncryption of Azure VM backups.
Supported scenarios for backup and restore of encrypted Azure VMs
This section describes the supported scenarios for backup and restore of encrypted Azure VMs.
Encryption using platform-managed keys
By default, all the disks in your VMs are automatically encrypted-at-rest using platform-managed keys (PMK) that usestorage service encryption. You can back up these VMs using Azure Backup without any specific actions required to support encryption on your end. For more information about encryption with platform-managed keys,see this article.

Encryption using customer-managed keys
When you encrypt disks with customer-managed keys (CMK), the key used for encrypting the disks is stored in the Azure Key Vault and is managed by you. Storage Service Encryption (SSE) using CMK differs from Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) encryption. ADE uses the encryption tools of the operating system. SSE encrypts data in the storage service, enabling you to use any OS or images for your VMs.
You don't need to perform any explicit actions for backup or restore of VMs that use customer-managed keys for encrypting their disks. The backup data for these VMs stored in the vault will be encrypted with the same methods as theencryption used on the vault.
For more information about encryption of managed disks with customer-managed keys, seethis article.
Encryption support using ADE
Azure Backup supports backup of Azure VMs that have their OS/data disks encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption (ADE). ADE uses BitLocker for encryption of Windows VMs, and the dm-crypt feature for Linux VMs. ADE integrates with Azure Key Vault to manage disk-encryption keys and secrets. Key Vault Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) can be used to add an additional layer of security, encrypting encryption secrets before writing them to Key Vault.
Azure Backup can back up and restore Azure VMs using ADE with and without the Microsoft Entra app, as summarized in the following table.
Learn more aboutADE,Key Vault, andKEKs.
Read theFAQfor Azure VM disk encryption.
Limitations
Before you back up or restore encrypted Azure VNs, review the following limitations:
You can back up and restore ADE encrypted VMs within the same subscription.
Azure Backup supports VMs encrypted using standalone keys. Any key that's a part of a certificate used to encrypt a VM isn't currently supported.
Azure Backup supports Cross Region Restore of encrypted Azure VMs to the Azure paired regions. For more information, seesupport matrix.
ADE encrypted VMs canât be recovered at the file/folder level. You need to recover the entire VM to restore files and folders.
When restoring a VM, you can't use thereplace existing VMoption for ADE encrypted VMs. This option is only supported for unencrypted managed disks.
Before you start
Before you start, do the following:
Make sure you have one or moreWindowsorLinuxVMs with ADE enabled.

Createa Recovery Services Backup vault if you don't have one.
If you enable encryption for VMs that are already enabled for backup, you simply need to provide Backup with permissions to access the Key Vault so that backups can continue without disruption.Learn moreabout assigning these permissions.
In addition, there are a couple of things that you might need to do in some circumstances:
Install the VM agent on the VM: Azure Backup backs up Azure VMs by installing an extension to the Azure VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure Marketplace image, the agent is installed and running. If you create a custom VM, or you migrate an on-premises machine, you might need toinstall the agent manually.
Configure a backup policy
To configure a backup policy, follow these steps:
If you haven't yet created a Recovery Services backup vault, followthese instructions.

Back up ADE encrypted VMs with RBAC enabled key vaults
To enable backups for ADE encrypted VMs using Azure RBAC enabled key vaults, you need to assign Key Vault Administrator role to the Backup Management Service Microsoft Entra app by adding a role assignment in Access Control of key vault.
Note
VM Backup operations use theBackup Management Serviceapp instead ofRecovery Services vault Managed Service Identity (MSI)to access Key Vault. You must grant the necessary Key Vault permissions to this app for backups to function properly.

Learn about thedifferent available roles. TheKey Vault Administratorrole can allow permissions toget,list, andback upboth secret and key.
For Azure RBAC enabled key vaults, you can create custom role with the following set of permissions. Learnhow to create custom role.

Trigger a backup job
The initial backup will run in accordance with the schedule, but you can run it immediately as follows:
Navigate toBackup centerand select theBackup Instancesmenu item.
SelectAzure Virtual machinesas theDatasource typeand search for the VM that you have configured for backup.
Right-click the relevant row or select the more icon (â¦), and clickBackup Now.
InBackup Now, use the calendar control to select the last day that the recovery point should be retained. Then selectOK.
Monitor the portal notifications.
To monitor the job progress, go toBackup center>Backup Jobsand filter the list forIn progressjobs.
Depending on the size of your VM, creating the initial backup may take a while.
Provide permissions
Azure Backup needs read-only access to back up the keys and secrets, along with the associated VMs.
Your Key Vault is associated with the Microsoft Entra tenant of the Azure subscription. If you're aMember user, Azure Backup acquires access to the Key Vault without further action.
If you're aGuest user, you must provide permissions for Azure Backup to access the key vault. You need to have access to key vaults to configure Backup for encrypted VMs.
To provide Azure RBAC permissions on Key Vault, seethis article.
To set permissions:
In the Azure portal, selectAll services, and search forKey vaults.
