Note
These virtual machine sizes are aprevious generation series. While older VM sizes are supported until further notice, we recommended using newer generations for improved performance and security. Check out the sizes overview'slist of VM size families by typefor a selection of newer sizes.
Dv2 and Dsv2-series, a follow-on to the original D-series, features a more powerful CPU. DSv2-series sizes run on the third Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors. The Dv2-series has the same memory and disk configurations as the D-series.
