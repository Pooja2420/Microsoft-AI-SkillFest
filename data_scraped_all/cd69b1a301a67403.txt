In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to prepare a virtual network to deploy S/4 HANA infrastructure usingAzure Center for SAP solutions. This article provides general guidance about creating a virtual network. Your individual environment and use case will determine how you need to configure your own network settings for use with aVirtual Instance for SAP (VIS)resource.
If you have an existing network that you're ready to use with Azure Center for SAP solutions,go to the deployment guideinstead of following this guide.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription.
Review the quotas for your Azure subscription. If the quotas are low, you might need to create a support request before creating your infrastructure deployment. Otherwise, you might experience deployment failures or anInsufficient quotaerror.
It's recommended to have multiple IP addresses in the subnet or subnets before you begin deployment. For example, it's always better to have a/26mask instead of/29.
/26
/29
The names including AzureFirewallSubnet, AzureFirewallManagementSubnet, AzureBastionSubnet and GatewaySubnet are reserved names within Azure. Please do not use these as the subnet names.
Note the SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) and database memory size that you need to allow Azure Center for SAP solutions to size your SAP system. If you're not sure, you can also select the VMs. There are:A single or cluster of ASCS VMs, which make up a single ASCS instance in the VIS.A single or cluster of Database VMs, which make up a single Database instance in the VIS.A single Application Server VM, which makes up a single Application instance in the VIS. Depending on the number of Application Servers being deployed or registered, there can be multiple application instances.
A single or cluster of ASCS VMs, which make up a single ASCS instance in the VIS.
A single or cluster of Database VMs, which make up a single Database instance in the VIS.
A single Application Server VM, which makes up a single Application instance in the VIS. Depending on the number of Application Servers being deployed or registered, there can be multiple application instances.
Create network
You must create a network for the infrastructure deployment on Azure. Make sure to create the network in the same region that you want to deploy the SAP system.
Some of the required network components are:
A virtual network
Subnets for the Application Servers and Database Servers. Your configuration needs to allow communication between these subnets.
Azure network security groups
Route tables
Firewalls (or NAT Gateway)
For more information, see theexample network configuration.
Connect network
At a minimum, the network needs to have outbound internet connectivity for successful infrastructure deployment and software installation. The application and database subnets also need to be able to communicate with each other.
If internet connectivity isn't possible, allowlist the IP addresses for the following areas:
SUSE or Red Hat endpoints
Azure Storage accounts
Allowlist Azure Key Vault
Allowlist Microsoft Entra ID
Allowlist Azure Resource Manager
Then, make sure all resources within the virtual network can connect to each other. For example,configure a network security groupto allow resources within the virtual network to communicate by listening on all ports.
Set theSource port rangesto*.
Set theDestination port rangesto*.
Set theActiontoAllow
If it's not possible to allow the resources within the virtual network to connect to each other, allow connections between the application and database subnets, andopen important SAP ports in the virtual networkinstead.
Allowlist SUSE or Red Hat endpoints
If you're using SUSE for the VMs,allowlist the SUSE endpoints. For example:
Create a VM with any OSusing the Azure portalorusing Azure Cloud Shell. Or, installopenSUSE Leapfrom the Microsoft Store and enable WSL.
Installpip3by runningzypper install python3-pip.
zypper install python3-pip
Install thepippackagesusepubliccloudinfoby runningpip3 install susepubliccloudinfo.
pip3 install susepubliccloudinfo
Get a list of IP addresses to configure in the network and firewall by runningpint microsoft servers --json --regionwith the appropriate Azure region parameter.
pint microsoft servers --json --region
Allowlist all these IP addresses on the firewall or network security group where you're planning to attach the subnets.
If you're using Red Hat for the VMs,allowlist the Red Hat endpointsas needed. The default allowlist is the Azure Global IP addresses. Depending on your use case, you might also need to allowlist Azure US Government or Azure Germany IP addresses. Configure all IP addresses from your list on the firewall or the network security group where you want to attach the subnets.
Allowlist storage accounts
Azure Center for SAP solutions needs access to the following storage accounts to install SAP software correctly:
The storage account where you're storing the SAP media that is required during software installation.
The storage account created by Azure Center for SAP solutions in a managed resource group, which Azure Center for SAP solutions also owns and manages.
There are multiple options to allow access to these storage accounts:
Allow internet connectivity
Configure aStorageservice tag
ConfigureStorageservice tagswith regional scope. Make sure to configure tags for the Azure region where you're deploying the infrastructure, and where the storage account with the SAP media exists.
Allowlist the regionalAzure IP ranges.
Allowlist Key Vault
Azure Center for SAP solutions creates a key vault to store and access the secret keys during software installation. This key vault also stores the SAP system password. To allow access to this key vault, you can:
Allow internet connectivity
Configure aAzureKeyVaultservice tag
Configure anAzureKeyVaultservice tagwith regional scope. Make sure to configure the tag in the region where you're deploying the infrastructure.

Allowlist Microsoft Entra ID
Azure Center for SAP solutions uses Microsoft Entra ID to get the authentication token for obtaining secrets from a managed key vault during SAP installation. To allow access to Microsoft Entra ID, you can:
Allow internet connectivity
Configure anAzureActiveDirectoryservice tag.
Allowlist Azure Resource Manager
Azure Center for SAP solutions uses a managed identity for software installation. Managed identity authentication requires a call to the Azure Resource Manager endpoint. To allow access to this endpoint, you can:
Allow internet connectivity
Configure anAzureResourceManagerservice tag.
Open important SAP ports
If you're unable toallow connection between all resources in the virtual networkas previously described, you can open important SAP ports in the virtual network instead. This method allows resources within the virtual network to listen on these ports for communication purposes. If you're using more than one subnet, these settings also allow connectivity within the subnets.
Open the SAP ports listed in the following table. Replace the placeholder values (xx) in applicable ports with your SAP instance number. For example, if your SAP instance number is01, then32xxbecomes3201.
xx
01
32xx
3201
