Create an Azure DevOps project to set up a source code repository and organize your work. You can tailor and manage your project to meet your business requirements. Each project isolates its data from other projects. For more information, seeAbout projects and scaling your organization.
Important

Select the version of this article that corresponds to your platform and version. The version selector is above the table of contents.Look up your Azure DevOps platform and version.
Note
If you don't want to manage an on-premises server,sign up for Azure DevOps Servicesand create a project.
Prerequisites
Important
To create a public project ormake a private project public, enable other policy settings to work with public projects, and then return to this article to create your project.
Create a project
You can create up to 1,000 projects within an organization in Azure DevOps. For more information, seeWork tracking, process, and project limits.
Important
When you create a project from the web portal, Azure DevOps ignores several process template files. Specifically, the files that would create a Report Manager site aren't supported. You can add reports later by following the instructions provided inAdd reports to a teams project.
There isn't a limit on the number of projects that you can create within a project collection, however for performance purposes, we recommend you limit the number to 300 or fewer. For more information, seeWork tracking, process, and project limits.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
Q: How do I resolve permission-related errors?
A: If you receive an error message that states you don't have permission to create a project, you need to request organization-level permissions. SeeChange permissions at the organization- or collection-level.
A: If you receive an error message that states you don't have permission to create a project, you need to request collection-level permissions. SeeChange permissions at the organization or collection-level. If you have SQL Reporting Services installed in the collection, you also need permissions for reports to theTeam Foundation Content Managers group.

A:Error TF30321: The name you entered is already used for another project on the Team Foundation Serverindicates that you should use a different name for your project. The name you entered is either in active use or is partially deleted, but not fully deleted.
