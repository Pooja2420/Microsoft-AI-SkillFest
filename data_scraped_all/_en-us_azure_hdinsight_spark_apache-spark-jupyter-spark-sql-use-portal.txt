Quickstart: Create Apache Spark cluster in Azure HDInsight using Azure portal
Article

In this article
In this quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create an Apache Spark cluster in Azure HDInsight. You then create a Jupyter Notebook, and use it to run Spark SQL queries against Apache Hive tables. Azure HDInsight is a managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service for enterprises. The Apache Spark framework for HDInsight enables fast data analytics and cluster computing using in-memory processing. Jupyter Notebook lets you interact with your data, combine code with markdown text, and do simple visualizations.
For in-depth explanations of available configurations, seeSet up clusters in HDInsight. For more information regarding the use of the portal to create clusters, seeCreate clusters in the portal.
If you're using multiple clusters together, you may want to create a virtual network; if you're using a Spark cluster may also want to use the Hive Warehouse Connector. For more information, seePlan a virtual network for Azure HDInsightandIntegrate Apache Spark and Apache Hive with the Hive Warehouse Connector.
Important
Billing for HDInsight clusters is prorated per minute, whether you are using them or not. Be sure to delete your cluster after you have finished using it. For more information, see theClean up resourcessection of this article.

Create an Apache Spark cluster in HDInsight
You use the Azure portal to create an HDInsight cluster that uses Azure Storage Blobs as the cluster storage. For more information on using Data Lake Storage Gen2, seeQuickstart: Set up clusters in HDInsight.

If you run into an issue with creating HDInsight clusters, it could be that you don't have the right permissions to do so. For more information, seeAccess control requirements.
Create a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive notebook environment that supports various programming languages. The notebook allows you to interact with your data, combine code with markdown text and perform simple visualizations.
From a web browser, navigate tohttps://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/jupyter, whereCLUSTERNAMEis the name of your cluster. If prompted, enter the cluster login credentials for the cluster.

Run Apache Spark SQL statements
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most common and widely used language for querying and defining data. Spark SQL functions as an extension to Apache Spark for processing structured data, using the familiar SQL syntax.

Clean up resources
HDInsight saves your data in Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it isn't in use. You're also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it isn't in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they aren't in use. If you plan to work on the tutorial listed inNext stepsimmediately, you might want to keep the cluster.
Switch back to the Azure portal, and selectDelete.

You can also select the resource group name to open the resource group page, and then selectDelete resource group. By deleting the resource group, you delete both the HDInsight cluster, and the default storage account.
