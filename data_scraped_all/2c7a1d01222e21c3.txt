In Microsoft Azure Media Services, aStreaming Endpointrepresents a dynamic (just-in-time) packaging and origin service that can deliver your live and on-demand content directly to a client player app, using one of the common streaming media protocols (HLS or DASH). TheStreaming Endpointalso provides dynamic (just-in-time) encryption to industry-leading DRMs.
When you create a Media Services account, adefaultstreaming endpoint is created for you in a stopped state. You can create more streaming endpoints can be created under the account (seeQuotas and limits).
Note
To start streaming videos, you need to start theStreaming Endpointfrom which you want to stream the video.
You're only billed when your streaming endpoint is in the running state.
Make sure to also review the articleDynamic packaging.
Naming convention
The host name format of the streaming URL is{servicename}-{accountname}-{regionname}.streaming.media.azure.net, whereservicename= the streaming endpoint name or the live event name.
{servicename}-{accountname}-{regionname}.streaming.media.azure.net
servicename
When using the default streaming endpoint,servicenameis omitted so the URL is:{accountname}-{regionname}.streaming.azure.net.
servicename
{accountname}-{regionname}.streaming.azure.net
Limitations
The streaming endpoint name has a max value of 24 characters.
The name should follow thisregexpattern:^[a-zA-Z0-9]+(-*[a-zA-Z0-9])*$.
^[a-zA-Z0-9]+(-*[a-zA-Z0-9])*$
Types
There are twoStreaming Endpointtypes:Standard(preview) andPremium. The type is defined by the number of scale units (scaleUnits) you allocate for the streaming endpoint.
scaleUnits
The maximum streaming unit limit is usually 10. ContactAzure supportto raise the limit for your account.
The following table describes the Premium and Standard streaming endpoint types.

Note
For customers looking to deliver content to large internet audiences, we recommend you enable CDN on the streaming endpoint.
Comparing streaming types
1Only used directly on the streaming endpoint when the CDN isn't enabled on the endpoint.2Standard streaming endpoints use a shared pool of resources.

Note
The SLA is only applicable to the Premium streaming endpoints and not the Standard streaming endpoints. For information on SLA, seePricing and SLA.

Streaming endpoint properties
This section discusses some of the properties of streaming endpoints. For examples of how to create a new streaming endpoint and descriptions of all the properties, seeStreaming endpoint.
accessControl- Configures the following security settings for this streaming endpoint: Akamai Signature Header Authentication keys and IP addresses that are allowed to connect to this endpoint. This property can only be set whencdnEnabledis set to false.
accessControl
cdnEnabled
cdnEnabled- Indicates if the Azure CDN integration for this streaming endpoint is enabled (disabled by default). If you setcdnEnabledto true, the following configurations get disabled:customHostNamesandaccessControl.Not all data centers support the Azure CDN integration. To check if your data center has the Azure CDN integration available, do the following steps:Try to set thecdnEnabledto true.Check the returned result for theHTTP Error Code 412(PreconditionFailed) message - "Streaming endpoint CdnEnabled property can't be set to true as CDN capability is unavailable in the current region."If you get this error, the data center doesn't support it. Try another data center.

cdnProfile- WhencdnEnabledis set to true, you can also passcdnProfilevalues.cdnProfileis the name of the CDN profile where the CDN endpoint point gets created. You can provide an existingcdnProfileor use a new one. If value isNULLandcdnEnabledis true, the default value "AzureMediaStreamingPlatformCdnProfile" is used. If the providedcdnProfileexists already, an endpoint gets created under it. If the profile doesn't exist, a new profile automatically gets created.

customHostNames- Configures a streaming endpoint to accept traffic directed to a custom host name. This property is valid for Standard and Premium streaming endpoints and can be set whencdnEnabledis false.The ownership of the domain name must be confirmed by Media Services. Media Services verifies the domain name ownership with the help of theCNamerecord that contains the Media Services account ID as a component to be added to the domain in use. For example, if you use "sports.contoso.com" as a custom host name for the streaming endpoint, configure a record for<accountId>.contoso.comto point to one of Media Services verification host names. The verification host name is composed ofverifydns.<mediaservices-dns-zone>.Following are the expected DNS zones to be used in the verify record for different Azure regions.North America, Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, and Japan:media.azure.netverifydns.media.azure.netChina:mediaservices.chinacloudapi.cnverifydns.mediaservices.chinacloudapi.cnFor example, aCNamerecord that maps "945a4c4e-28ea-45cd-8ccb-a519f6b700ad.contoso.com" to "verifydns.media.azure.net" proves that the Media Services ID "945a4c4e-28ea-45cd-8ccb-a519f6b700ad" has the ownership of thecontoso.comdomain, enabling any name undercontoso.comto be used as a custom host name for a streaming endpoint under that account. To find the Media Service ID value, go to theAzure portaland select your Media Service account. TheAccount IDappears on the top right of the page.If there's an attempt to set a custom host name without a proper verification of theCNamerecord, the DNS response will fail and then be cached for some time. Once a proper record is in place, it might take some time until the cached response gets revalidated. Depending on the DNS provider for the custom domain, it takes anywhere from a few minutes to an hour to revalidate the record.In addition to theCNamethat maps<accountId>.<parent domain>toverifydns.<mediaservices-dns-zone>, you must create anotherCNamethat maps the custom host name (likesports.contoso.com) to your Media Services Streaming Endpoint's host name (likeamstest-usea.streaming.media.azure.net).NoteStreaming endpoints located in the same data center can't share the same custom host name.Presently, Media Services does not support TLS with custom domains.

Media services will be enforcing TLS 1.2 for all requests to KeyDelivery, RESTv2, Streaming Endpoint and Live Event streaming origins. Accounts with existing TLS 1.0 or 1.1 usage will be exempt from this enforcement. If you wish to enforce TLS 1.2 for all your requests to these media services endpoints, please contact AMS support.
Why use multiple streaming endpoints?
A single streaming endpoint can stream both live and on-demand videos and most customers use only one streaming endpoint. This section explains the scenarios that might need you to use multiple streaming endpoints.
Each reserved unit allows for 200 Mbps of bandwidth. If you need more than 2,000 Mbps (2 Gbps) of bandwidth, use the second streaming endpoint and load balance that provides an additional bandwidth.CDN is the best way to achieve the scale out for streaming content. However, if you are delivering so much content that the CDN is pulling more than 2 Gbps, you can add additional streaming endpoints (origins). In this case, you would need to hand out content URLs that are balanced across the two streaming endpoints. This approach gives better caching than trying to send requests to each origin randomly (for example, via a traffic manager).TipUsually, when the CDN is pulling more than 2 Gbps, then something might be misconfigured (for example, no origin shielding).

Load balancing different CDN providers - For example, you could set up the default streaming endpoint to use the Verizon CDN and create a second one to use Akamai. Now, add load balancing between the two endpoints to achieve multi-CDN balancing.However, the customer often does load balancing across multiple CDN providers using a single origin.

Streaming mixed content - Live streaming and video on-demand. The access patterns for live and on-demand content are different. The live content tends to get a lot of demand for the same content all at once. The video on-demand content (for example, a long tail archive content) has low usage on the same content. Thus, caching works very well on the live content but not as well on the long tail content.Consider a scenario in which your customers are mainly watching live content but are only occasionally watching on-demand content and it is served from the same streaming endpoint. The low usage of on-demand content would occupy cache space that would be better saved for the live content. In this scenario, we would recommend serving the live content from one streaming endpoint and the long tail content from another streaming endpoint. This will improve the performance of the live event content.
