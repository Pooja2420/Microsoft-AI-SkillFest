If theAzure built-in rolesdon't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own Azure custom roles. Just like built-in roles, you can assign custom roles to users, groups, and service principals at management group, subscription, and resource group scopes. Custom roles are stored in a Microsoft Entra directory and can be shared across subscriptions. Each directory can have up to 5000 custom roles. Custom roles can be created using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API. This article describes how to create custom roles using the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
To create custom roles, you need:
Permissions to create custom roles, such asOwnerorUser Access Administrator
Step 1: Determine the permissions you need
Azure has thousands of permissions that you can potentially include in your custom role. Here are some methods that can help you determine the permissions you will want to add to your custom role:
Look at existingbuilt-in roles.
List the Azure services you want to grant access to.
Determine theresource providers that map to the Azure services. A search method is described later inStep 4: Permissions.
Search theavailable permissionsto find permissions you want to include. A search method is described later inStep 4: Permissions.
Step 2: Choose how to start
There are three ways that you can start to create a custom role. You can clone an existing role, start from scratch, or start with a JSON file. The easiest way is to find an existing role that has most of the permissions you need and then clone and modify it for your scenario.
Clone a role
If an existing role does not quite have the permissions you need, you can clone it and then modify the permissions. Follow these steps to start cloning a role.
In the Azure portal, open a management group, subscription, or resource group where you want the custom role to be assignable and then openAccess control (IAM).The following screenshot shows the Access control (IAM) page opened for a subscription.

Start from JSON
If you prefer, you can specify most of your custom role values in a JSON file. You can open the file in the custom roles editor, make additional changes, and then create the custom role. Follow these steps to start with a JSON file.
Create a JSON file that has the following format:{
    "properties": {
        "roleName": "",
        "description": "",
        "assignableScopes": [],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "actions": [],
                "notActions": [],
                "dataActions": [],
                "notDataActions": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
Create a JSON file that has the following format:

        "roleName": "",
        "description": "",
        "assignableScopes": [],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "actions": [],
                "notActions": [],
                "dataActions": [],
                "notDataActions": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
{
    "properties": {
        "roleName": "",
        "description": "",

                "dataActions": [],
                "notDataActions": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
In the JSON file, specify values for the various properties. Here's an example with some values added. For information about the different properties, seeUnderstand Azure role definitions.{
    "properties": {
        "roleName": "Billing Reader Plus",

Step 4: Permissions
On thePermissionstab, you specify the permissions for your custom role. Depending on whether you cloned a role or if you started with JSON, the Permissions tab might already list some permissions.

Add or remove permissions
Follow these steps to add or remove permissions for your custom role.
To add permissions, clickAdd permissionsto open the Add permissions pane.This pane lists all available permissions grouped into different categories in a card format. Each category represents aresource provider, which is a service that supplies Azure resources.

To remove permissions, click the delete icon at the end of the row. In this example, since a user will not need the ability to create support tickets, theMicrosoft.Support/*permission can be deleted.

Microsoft.Support/*
Add wildcard permissions
Depending on how you chose to start, you might have permissions with wildcards (*) in your list of permissions. A wildcard (*) extends a permission to everything that matches the action string you provide. For example, the following wildcard string adds all permissions related to Azure Cost Management and exports. This would also include any future export permissions that might be added.
*
*
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/*
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/*
If you want to add a new wildcard permission, you can't add it using theAdd permissionspane. To add a wildcard permission, you have to add it manually using theJSONtab. For more information, seeStep 6: JSON.
Note
It's recommended that you specifyActionsandDataActionsexplicitly instead of using the wildcard (*) character. The additional access and permissions granted through futureActionsorDataActionsmight be unwanted behavior using the wildcard.

Exclude permissions
If your role has a wildcard (*) permission and you want to exclude or subtract specific permissions from that wildcard permission, you can exclude them. For example, let's say that you have the following wildcard permission:
*
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/*
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/*
If you don't want to allow an export to be deleted, you could exclude the following delete permission:
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/delete
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/delete
When you exclude a permission, it is added as aNotActionsorNotDataActions. The effective management permissions are computed by adding all of theActionsand then subtracting all of theNotActions. The effective data permissions are computed by adding all of theDataActionsand then subtracting all of theNotDataActions.

Step 5: Assignable scopes
On theAssignable scopestab, you specify where your custom role is available for assignment, such as management group, subscriptions, or resource groups. Depending on how you chose to start, this tab might already list the scope where you opened the Access control (IAM) page.
You can define only one management group in assignable scopes. Setting assignable scope to root scope ("/") is not supported.
ClickAdd assignable scopesto open the Add assignable scopes pane.
