Dependency Agent in Azure Monitor VM insights

In this article
Dependency Agent collects data about processes running on the virtual machine and their external process dependencies. Updates include bug fixes or support of new features or functionality. This article describes Dependency Agent requirements and how to upgrade it manually or through automation.
Note
Dependency Agent sends heartbeat data to theInsightsMetricstable, for which you incur data ingestion charges. This behavior is different from Azure Monitor Agent, which sends agent health data to theHeartbeattable that is free from data collection charges.
Dependency Agent requirements
Azure Monitor agent must be installed on the same machine.
Requires a connection from the virtual machine to the address 169.254.169.254. This address identifies the Azure metadata service endpoint.
Operating systems supported
VM insights supports the following operating systems:
VM Insights supports all operating systems supported by the Azure Monitor Agent. SeeAzure Monitor Agent supported operating systems and environments.
The Dependency Agent currently supports the sameWindows versions that Azure Monitor Agent supportsup to Windows Server 2022, except Azure Stack HCI and Windows IoT Enterprise. Windows Server Core isn't supported.
For the Dependency Agent's Linux support, seeDependency Agent Linux supportandLinux considerations.
The Dependency Agent only supports x64 architectures.
Linux considerations
Consider the following before you install Dependency agent for VM Insights on a Linux machine:
Only default and SMP Linux kernel releases are supported.
Nonstandard kernel releases, such as physical address extension (PAE) and Xen, aren't supported for any Linux distribution. For example, a system with the release string of2.6.16.21-0.8-xenisn't supported.
Custom kernels, including recompilations of standard kernels, aren't supported.
For Debian distros other than version 9.4, the Map feature isn't supported. The Performance feature is available only from the Azure Monitor menu. It isn't available directly from the left pane of the Azure VM.
CentOSPlus kernel is supported.
Installing Dependency agent taints the Linux kernel and you might lose support from your Linux distribution until the machine resets.
The Linux kernel must be patched for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. For more information, consult with your Linux distribution vendor. Run the following command to check for availability if Spectre/Meltdown has been mitigated:
$ grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*
$ grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*
Output for this command looks similar to the following and specify whether a machine is vulnerable to either issue. If these files are missing, the machine is unpatched.
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown:Mitigation: PTI
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v1:Vulnerable
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2:Vulnerable: Minimal generic ASM retpoline
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown:Mitigation: PTI
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v1:Vulnerable
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2:Vulnerable: Minimal generic ASM retpoline
Install or upgrade Dependency Agent
Note
Dependency Agent is installed automatically whenVM Insights is enabled on a machinefor process and connection data. If VM Insights is enabled exclusively for performance data, Dependency Agent won't be installed.
You can upgrade Dependency Agent for Windows and Linux manually or automatically, depending on the deployment scenario and environment the machine is running in, using these methods:
autoUpgradeMinorVersion
Manually install or upgrade Dependency Agent on Windows
Update the agent on a Windows VM from the command prompt, with a script or other automation solution, or by using the InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe Setup Wizard.
Download the latest version of the Windows agent fromaka.ms/dependencyagentwindows.
Sign on to the computer with an account that has administrative rights.

ExecuteInstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exeto start the Setup Wizard.
ExecuteInstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exeto start the Setup Wizard.
Follow theDependency Agent Setupwizard to uninstall the previous version of Dependency Agent and then install the latest version.

Run the following command:InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe /S /RebootMode=manualThe/RebootMode=manualparameter prevents the upgrade from automatically rebooting the machine if some processes are using files from the previous version and have a lock on them.
Run the following command:
InstallDependencyAgent-Windows.exe /S /RebootMode=manual

To confirm the upgrade was successful, check theinstall.logfor detailed setup information. The log directory is%Programfiles%\Microsoft Dependency Agent\logs.

Manually install or upgrade Dependency Agent on Linux
Upgrading from prior versions of Dependency Agent on Linux is supported and performed following the same command as a new installation.
Download the latest version of the Linux agent fromaka.ms/dependencyagentlinuxor via curl:
curl -L -o DependencyAgent-Linux64.bin https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux
curl -L -o DependencyAgent-Linux64.bin https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux
Note
Curl doesn't automatically set execution permissions. You need to manually set them using chmod:
chmod +x DependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
chmod +x DependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
Sign in on the computer with a user account that has sudo privileges to execute commands as root.
Sign in on the computer with a user account that has sudo privileges to execute commands as root.
Run the following command:sudo <path>/InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
Run the following command:
sudo <path>/InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
sudo <path>/InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
If Dependency Agent fails to start, check the logs for detailed error information. On Linux agents, the log directory is/var/opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/log.
Uninstall Dependency Agent
Note
If Dependency Agent was installed manually, it won't show in the Azure portal and has to be uninstalled manually. It will only show if it was installed via theAzure portal,PowerShell,ARM template deployment, orAzure policy.
From theVirtual Machinesmenu in the Azure portal, select your virtual machine.
From theVirtual Machinesmenu in the Azure portal, select your virtual machine.
SelectExtensions + applications>DependencyAgentWindowsorDependencyAgentLinux>Uninstall.
SelectExtensions + applications>DependencyAgentWindowsorDependencyAgentLinux>Uninstall.

Manually uninstall Dependency Agent on Windows
Method 1:In Windows, go toAdd and remove programs, find Microsoft Dependency Agent, click on the ellipsis to open the context menu, and selectUninstall.
Method 2:Use the uninstaller located in the Microsoft Dependency Agent folder, for example,C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dependency Agent"\Uninstall_v.w.x.y.exe(where v.w.x.y is the version number).
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dependency Agent"\Uninstall_v.w.x.y.exe
Manually uninstall Dependency Agent on Linux
Sign in on the computer with a user account that has sudo privileges to execute commands as root.
Sign in on the computer with a user account that has sudo privileges to execute commands as root.
Run the following command:sudo /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/uninstall -s
Run the following command:
sudo /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/uninstall -s
sudo /opt/microsoft/dependency-agent/uninstall -s
Dependency Agent Linux support
Since Dependency Agent works at the kernel level, support is also dependent on the kernel version. As of Dependency Agent version 9.10.* the agent supports * kernels. The following table lists the major and minor Linux OS release and supported kernel versions for Dependency Agent.
Note
With Dependency agent 9.10.15 and above, installation is not blocked for unsupported kernel versions, but the agent will run in degraded mode. In this mode, connection and port data stored in VMConnection and VMBoundport tables is not collected. The VMProcess table may have some data, but it will be minimal.
Note
Dependency agent is not supported for Azure Virtual Machines with Ampere Altra ARMâbased processors.
