Requirements and considerations
You need to be aware of several requirements and considerations before using Azure NetApp Files backup:
Important
All backups require a backup vault. If you have existing backups, you must migrate backups to a backup vault before you can perform any operation with a backup. For more information, seeManage backup vaults.
Azure NetApp Files backup is available in the regions associated with your Azure NetApp Files subscription.
Azure NetApp Files backup in a region can only protect an Azure NetApp Files volume located in that same region. For example, backups created by the service in West US 2 for a volume located in West US 2 are sent to Azure storage also located in West US 2. Azure NetApp Files doesn't support backups or backup replication to a different region.

There can be a delay of up to 5 minutes in displaying a backup after the backup is actually completed.

For volumes larger than 10 TiB, it can take multiple hours to transfer all the data from the backup media.

The Azure NetApp Files backup feature supports backing up the daily, weekly, and monthly local snapshots to the Azure storage. Hourly backups aren't currently supported.

Azure NetApp Files backup uses theZone-Redundant storage(ZRS) account that replicates the data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the region, except for the regions listed where onlyLocally Redundant Storage (LRS)storage is supported:West USLRS can recover from server-rack and drive failures. However, if a disaster such as a fire or flooding occurs within the data center, all replicas of a storage account using LRS might be lost or unrecoverable.

You can't apply a backup policy to a volume while a manual backup is in progress. Wait for the manual backup to complete before applying the policy.

In across-region replication(CRR) orcross-zone replication(CZR) setting, Azure NetApp Files backup can be configured on a source volume.Backups on a destination volume are only supported for manually created snapshots. To take backups of a destination volume, create a snapshot on the source volume then wait for the snapshot to be replicated to the destination volume. From the destination volume, you select the snapshot for backup. Scheduled backups on a destination volume aren't supported.

If you delete a volume, the backups remain. If you no longer need the backups, you shouldmanually delete the backups.

If you need to delete a parent resource group or subscription that contains backups, you should delete any backups first. Deleting the resource group or subscription doesn't delete the backups.
