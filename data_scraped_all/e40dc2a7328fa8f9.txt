Performance counters provide insight into the performance of virtual hardware components, operating systems, and workloads. Collect counters from both Windows and Linux virtual machines using adata collection rule (DCR)with aPerformance Countersdata source.
Details for the creation of the DCR are provided inCollect data from VM client with Azure Monitor. This article provides additional details for the Performance Counters data source type.
Note
To work with the DCR definition directly or to deploy with other methods such as ARM templates, seeData collection rule (DCR) samples in Azure Monitor.
Configure performance counters data source
Create the DCR using the process inCollect data from virtual machine client with Azure Monitor. On theCollect and delivertab of the DCR, selectPerformance Countersfrom theData source typedropdown. Select from a predefined set of objects to collect and their sampling rate. The lower the sampling rate, the more frequently the value is collected.

SelectCustomto specify anXPathto collect any performance counters not available with theBasicselection. Use the format\PerfObject(ParentInstance/ObjectInstance#InstanceIndex)\Counter.
\PerfObject(ParentInstance/ObjectInstance#InstanceIndex)\Counter
Tip
If the counter name contains an ampersand (&), replace it with&amp;. For example,\Memory\Free &amp; Zero Page List Bytes.
&amp;
\Memory\Free &amp; Zero Page List Bytes

Warning
Be careful when manually defining counters for DCRs that are associated with both Windows and Linux machines, since some Windows and Linux style counter names can resolve to the same metric and cause duplicate collection. For example, specifying both\LogicalDisk(*)\Disk Transfers/sec(Windows) andLogical Disk(*)\Disk Transfers/sec(Linux) in the same DCR will cause the Disk Transfers metric to be collected twice per sampling period.
\LogicalDisk(*)\Disk Transfers/sec
Logical Disk(*)\Disk Transfers/sec
This behavior can be avoided by not collecting performance counters in DCRs that don't specify aplatform type. Ensure that Windows counters are only included in DCRs associated with Windows machines, and Linux counters are only included in DCRs associated with Linux machines.
Note
Microsoft.HybridCompute (Azure Arc-enabled servers) resources can't currently be viewed inMetrics Explorer, but their metric data can be acquired via the Metrics REST API (Metric Namespaces - List, Metric Definitions - List, and Metrics - List).
Add destinations
Performance counters can be sent to a Log Analytics workspace where it's stored in thePerftable and/or Azure Monitor Metrics (preview) where it's available inMetrics explorer. Add a destination of typeAzure Monitor Logsand select a Log Analytics workspace. While you can add multiple workspaces, be aware that this will send duplicate data to each which will result in additional cost. No further details are required forAzure Monitor Metrics (preview)since this is stored at the subscription level for the monitored resource.
Note
For Linux, using Azure Monitor Metrics as the only destination is supported in v1.10.9.0 or higher.

Verify data collection
To verify that data is being collected in the Log Analytics workspace, check for records in thePerftable. From the virtual machine or from the Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal, selectLogsand then click theTablesbutton. Under theVirtual machinescategory, clickRunnext toPerf.

To verify that data is being collected in Azure Monitor Metrics, selectMetricsfrom the virtual machine in the Azure portal. SelectVirtual Machine Guest(Windows) orazure.vm.linux.guestmetricsfor the namespace and then select a metric to add to the view.

Performance counters
The following performance counters are available to be collected by the Azure Monitor Agent for Windows and Linux virtual machines. The sample frequency can be changed when creating or updating the data collection rule.
