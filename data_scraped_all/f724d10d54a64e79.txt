This article explains how to configure a private connection to Azure AI Search so that it admits requests from clients in a virtual network instead of over a public internet connection:
Create an Azure virtual network, or use an existing one
Configure a search service to use a private endpoint
Create an Azure virtual machine (client) in the same virtual network
Test using a browser session on the virtual machine
Other Azure resources that might privately connect to Azure AI Search include Azure OpenAI for "use your own data" scenarios. Azure AI Foundry doesn't run in a virtual network, but it can be configured on the backend to send requests over the Microsoft backbone network. Configuration for this traffic pattern is enabled by Microsoft when your request is submitted and approved. For this scenario:
Follow the instructions in this article to set up the private endpoint.
Enable trusted serviceof your search resource from the Azure portal.
Optionally,disable public network accessif connections should only originate from clients in virtual network or from Azure OpenAI over a private endpoint connection.
Key points about private endpoints
Private endpoints are provided byAzure Private Link, as a separate billable service. For more information about costs, seeAzure Private Link pricing.
Once a search service has a private endpoint, portal access to that service must be initiated from a browser session on a virtual machine inside the virtual network. Seethis stepfor details.
You can create a private endpoint for a search service in the Azure portal, as described in this article. Alternatively, you can use theManagement REST API,Azure PowerShell, or theAzure CLI.
Why use a private endpoint?
Private endpointsfor Azure AI Search allow a client on a virtual network to securely access data in a search index over aPrivate Link. The private endpoint uses an IP address from thevirtual network address spacefor your search service. Network traffic between the client and the search service traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet. For a list of other PaaS services that support Private Link, check theavailability sectionin the product documentation.
Private endpoints for your search service allow you to:
Block all connections on the public endpoint for your search service.
Increase security for the virtual network, by letting you block exfiltration of data from the virtual network.
Securely connect to your search service from on-premises networks that connect to the virtual network usingVPNorExpressRouteswith private-peering.
Create the virtual network
In this section, you create a virtual network and subnet to host the VM that will be used to access your search service's private endpoint.

In this section, you verify private network access to the search service and connect privately to the using the Private Endpoint.
When the search service endpoint is private, some portal features are disabled. You can view and manage service level settings, but portal access to index data and various other components in the service, such as the index, indexer, and skillset definitions, is restricted for security reasons.

From the VM, connect to the search service and create an index. You can follow thisquickstartto create a new search index in your service using the REST API. Setting up requests from a Web API test tool requires the search service endpoint(https://[search service name].search.windows.net)and the admin api-key you copied in a previous step.

To verify that your service isn't accessible on a public endpoint, open a REST client on your local workstation and attempt the first several tasks in the quickstart. If you receive an error that the remote server doesn't exist, you successfully configured a private endpoint for your search service.

Use the Azure portal to access a private search service
When the search service endpoint is private, some portal features are disabled. You can view and manage service level information, but index, indexer, and skillset information are hidden for security reasons.
To work around this restriction, connect to Azure portal from a browser on a virtual machine inside the virtual network. the Azure portal uses the private endpoint on the connection and gives you visibility into content and operations.
Follow thesteps to provision a VM that can access the search service through a private endpoint.

Disable public network access
You can lock down a search service to prevent it from admitting any request from the public internet. You can use the Azure portal for this step.
In the Azure portal, on the leftmost pane of your search service page, selectNetworking.

Clean up resources
When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money.
You can delete individual resources or the resource group to delete everything you created in this exercise. Select the resource group on any resource's overview page, and then selectDelete.
Next step
In this article, you created a VM on a virtual network and a search service with a private endpoint. You connected to the VM from the internet and securely communicated to the search service using Private Link. To learn more about private endpoints, seeWhat is a private endpoint?
