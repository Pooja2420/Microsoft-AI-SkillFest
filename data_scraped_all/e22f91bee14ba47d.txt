This guide describes the recommendations for adding redundancy throughout critical flows at different workload layers, which optimizes resiliency. Meet the requirements of your defined reliability targets by applying the proper levels of redundancy to your compute, data, networking, and other infrastructure tiers. Apply this redundancy to give your workload a strong, reliable foundation to build on. When you build your workload without infrastructure redundancy, there's a high risk of extended downtime due topotential failures.

Key design strategies
In the context of reliability, use redundancy to contain problems that affect a single resource and ensure that those problems don't affect the reliability of the entire system. Use the information that you identified about your critical flows and reliability targets to make informed decisions that are required for each flow's redundancy.
For example, you might have multiple web server nodes running at once. The criticality of the flow that they support might require that all of them have replicas that are ready to accept traffic if there's a problem that affects the entire pool, for example a regional outage. Alternatively, because large-scale problems are rare and it's costly to deploy an entire set of replicas, you might deploy a limited number of replicas so the flow operates in a degraded state until you resolve the problem.
When you design for redundancy in the context of performance efficiency, distribute the load across multiple redundant nodes to ensure that each node performs optimally. In the context of reliability, build in spare capacity to absorb failures or malfunctions that affect one or more nodes. Ensure that the spare capacity can absorb failures for the entire time that's needed to recover the affected nodes. With this distinction in mind, both strategies need to work together. If you spread traffic across two nodes for performance and they both run at 60 percent utilization and one node fails, your remaining node is at risk of becoming overwhelmed because it can't operate at 120 percent. Spread the load out with another node to ensure that your performance and reliability targets are upheld.
Tradeoffs:
More workload redundancy equates to more costs. Carefully consider adding redundancy and regularly review your architecture to ensure that you're managing costs, especially when you use overprovisioning. When you use overprovisioning as a resiliency strategy, balance it with a well-definedscaling strategyto minimize cost inefficiencies.
There can be performance tradeoffs when you build in a high degree of redundancy. For example, resources that spread across availability zones or regions can affect performance because you have to send traffic over high-latency connections between redundant resources, like web servers or database instances.
Different flows within the same workload might have different reliability requirements. Flow-specific redundancy designs can potentially introduce complexity into the overall design.
Consider two approaches when you design a redundant architecture: active-active or active-passive. Choose your approach depending on the criticality of the user flow and system flow that the infrastructure components support. In terms of reliability, a multi-region active-active design helps you achieve the highest level of reliability possible, but it's significantly more expensive than an active-passive design. Deciding the appropriate geographic regions become the next critical choice. You can also use these design approaches for a single region by using availability zones. For more information, seeRecommendations for highly available multi-region design.
Whether you deploy in an active-active or active-passive model, follow theDeployment Stamps design patternto ensure that you deploy your workload in a repeatable, scalable way. Deployment stamps are the groupings of resources that are required to deliver your workload to a given subset of your customers. For example, the subset might be a regional subset or a subset with all the same data privacy requirements as your workload. Think of each stamp as aunit of scalethat you can duplicate to scale your workload horizontally or to perform blue-green deployments. Design your workload with deployment stamps to optimize your active-active or active-passive implementation for resiliency and management burden. Planning for multi-region scale out is also important to overcome potential temporary resource capacity constraints in a region.
Whether you deploy an active-active or an active-passive design, take advantage ofavailability zoneswithin the active regions to fully optimize your resiliency. Many Azure regions provide multiple availability zones, which are separated groups of data centers within a region. Depending on the Azure service, you can take advantage of availability zones by deploying elements of your workload redundantly across zones or pinning elements to specific zones. For more information, seeRecommendations for using availability zones and regions.
Implement zone redundancy for compute resources
Choose the appropriatecompute servicefor your workload. Depending on the type of workload that you design, there might be several options available. Research the available services and understand which types of workloads work best on a given compute service. For example, SAP workloads are typically best suited for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) compute services. For a containerized application, determine the specific functionality you need to have control over to determine whether to use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or a platform as a service (PaaS) solution. Your cloud platform fully manages a PaaS service.

Overprovision critical resources to mitigate failures of redundant instances, even before autoscaling operations begin, so the system continues to operate after a component failure. Calculate the acceptable effect of a fault when you incorporate overprovisioning into your redundancy design. As with your redundancy decision-making process, your reliability targets and financial tradeoff decisions determine the extent that you add spare capacity with overprovisioning. Overprovisioning specifically refers toscaling out, which means adding extra instances of a given compute resource type, rather than increasing the compute capabilities of any single instance. For example, if you change a VM from a lower-tier SKU to a higher-tier SKU.

Consider data consistency requirements and useeventual consistencywhen requirements allow it. When data is distributed, use appropriate coordination to enforce strong consistency guarantees. Coordination can reduce your throughput and make your systems tightly coupled, which can make them more brittle. For example, if an operation updates two databases, instead of putting it into a single transaction scope, it's better if the system can accommodate eventual consistency.

If sharding isn't an option, you can use theCommand and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patternto separate your read-write and read-only data models. Add more redundant read-only database instances to provide more resilience.

For hybrid name resolution scenarios between on-premises and cloud environments, use Azure DNS Private Resolver. This service supports zone redundancy if your workload is located in a region that supports availability zones. A zone-wide outage requires no action during zone recovery. The service automatically self-heals and rebalances to take advantage of the healthy zone. For more information, seeResiliency in Azure DNS Private Resolver.

To eliminate a single point of failure and achieve a more resilient hybrid name resolution across regions, deploy two or more Azure DNS private resolvers across different regions. DNS failover, in a conditional forwarding scenario, is achieved by assigning a resolver as your primary DNS server. Assign the other resolver in a different region as a secondary DNS server. For more information, seeSet up DNS failover by using private resolvers.
