Tutorial: Integrate NAT gateway with Azure Firewall in a hub and spoke network for outbound connectivity

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate a NAT gateway with an Azure Firewall in a hub and spoke network
Azure Firewall provides2,496 SNAT ports per public IP addressconfigured per backend Virtual Machine Scale Set instance (minimum of two instances). You can associate up to 250 public IP addresses to Azure Firewall. Depending on your architecture requirements and traffic patterns, you may require more SNAT ports than what Azure Firewall can provide. You may also require the use of fewer public IPs while also requiring more SNAT ports. A better method for outbound connectivity is to use NAT gateway. NAT gateway provides 64,512 SNAT ports per public IP address and can be used with up to 16 public IP addresses.
NAT gateway can be integrated with Azure Firewall by configuring NAT gateway directly to the Azure Firewall subnet in order to provide a more scalable method of outbound connectivity. For production deployments, a hub and spoke network is recommended, where the firewall is in its own virtual network. The workload servers are peered virtual networks in the same region as the hub virtual network where the firewall resides. In this architectural setup, NAT gateway can provide outbound connectivity from the hub virtual network for all spoke virtual networks peered.

Note
Azure NAT Gateway is not currently supported in secured virtual hub network (vWAN) architectures. You must deploy using a hub virtual network architecture as described in this tutorial. For more information about Azure Firewall architecture options, seeWhat are the Azure Firewall Manager architecture options?.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a hub virtual network and deploy an Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion during deployment
Create a NAT gateway and associate it with the firewall subnet in the hub virtual network
Create a spoke virtual network
Create a virtual network peering
Create a route table for the spoke virtual network
Create a firewall policy for the hub virtual network
Create a virtual machine to test the outbound connectivity through the NAT gateway
Prerequisites

Wait for the virtual machine to finishing deploying before proceeding to the next steps.
Note
Virtual machines in a virtual network with a bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in bastion hosted virtual networks. For more information, seeDissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM.
Test NAT gateway
You connect to the Ubuntu virtual machines you created in the previous steps to verify that the outbound internet traffic is leaving the NAT gateway.
