How to configure subnet peering

In this article
Subnet peering refers to a method of connecting two virtual networks by linking the subnet address spaces rather than the entire virtual network address spaces. It lets users specify which subnets are supposed to participate in the peering across the local and remote virtual networks.
Subnet peering is an added flexibility built on top of virtual network peering. Users get an option to choose specific subnets that need to be peered across virtual networks. Users can specify or enter the list of subnets across the virtual networks that they want to peer. In contrast, in regular virtual network peering, entire address space/subnets across the virtual networks get peered.
The following limitations apply in regards to using subnet peering:

Configure subnet peering
The how-to article requires version 2.31.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
In the existing virtual network peering create process, few new optional parameters are introduced. This is the description/reference of each:
New optional parameters introduced:
--peer-complete-vnetThis parameter would let users exercise an option to select subnet peering. By default the value for this parameter is set to true, which means entire virtual networks are peered (all address spaces/subnets). To use subnet peering, this parameter needs to be set to false.Accepted values: 0, 1, f, false, n, no, t, true, y, yesDefault value: True
--peer-complete-vnetThis parameter would let users exercise an option to select subnet peering. By default the value for this parameter is set to true, which means entire virtual networks are peered (all address spaces/subnets). To use subnet peering, this parameter needs to be set to false.Accepted values: 0, 1, f, false, n, no, t, true, y, yesDefault value: True
--local-subnet-namesThis parameter lets users enter local subnet names they want to peer with the remote subnets when subnet peering is enabled by setting âpeer-complete-vnetâ parameter as 0
--local-subnet-namesThis parameter lets users enter local subnet names they want to peer with the remote subnets when subnet peering is enabled by setting âpeer-complete-vnetâ parameter as 0
--remote-subnet-namesThis parameter would let users enter remote subnet names they want to peer with the local subnets when subnet peering is enabled by setting âpeer-complete-vnetâ parameter as 0
--remote-subnet-namesThis parameter would let users enter remote subnet names they want to peer with the local subnets when subnet peering is enabled by setting âpeer-complete-vnetâ parameter as 0
--enable-only-ipv6This parameter would let users exercise an option to configure subnet peering over IPv6 address space only (for dual stack subnets). By default, the value for this parameter is set to false. Peering is done over IPv4 addresses by default. If set to true, peering is done over IPv6 in dual stack subnets.Accepted values: 0, 1, f, false, n, no, t, true, y, yes
--enable-only-ipv6This parameter would let users exercise an option to configure subnet peering over IPv6 address space only (for dual stack subnets). By default, the value for this parameter is set to false. Peering is done over IPv4 addresses by default. If set to true, peering is done over IPv6 in dual stack subnets.Accepted values: 0, 1, f, false, n, no, t, true, y, yes

After creating the required subnets, let's say we want to connect only subnet-1 from vnet-1 and subnet-3 from vnet-2, instead of peering the entire virtual network. For this, we use the optional parameters described above to achieve this.For this, we run the virtual network peering create command with the optional parameters.az network vnet peering create --name vnet-1_to_vnet-2

Subnet peering checks and limitations
The following diagram displays the checks performed while configuring subnet peering and current limitations.

The participating subnetsmust be uniqueandmust belong to unique address spaces.For example, in the virtual network A and virtual network C peering (illustrated in the figure by black arrow headed line) virtual network A can't subnet peer over Subnet 1, Subnet 2 and Subnet 3 with any of the subnets in virtual network C, as these subnets of virtual network A belong to the 10.1.0.0/16 address space which is also present in virtual network C.However, virtual network Aâs Subnet 4 (10.0.1.0/24) can subnet peer with Subnet 5 in virtual network C (10.6.1.0/24) as these subnets are unique across the virtual networks and they belong to unique address spaces across virtual networks. Subnet 4 belongs to 10.0.0.0/16 address space in virtual network A and Subnet 5 belongs to 10.6.0.0/16 address space in virtual network C.

There can beonly one peering link between any two virtual networks. If you want to add or remove subnets from the peering link, then the same peering link is required to be updated.Multiple exclusive peering between set of subnets are not possible.A given peering link type cannot be changed. If there's a virtual network peering between virtual network A and virtual network B, and the user wants to change that to subnet peering, the existing virtual network peering link must be deleted, and a new peering must be created with the required parameters for subnet peering and vice versa.

Number of subnets that can be part of a peering link should be less than or equal to 400 (200 limit from each local and remote side).For example, in the virtual network A and virtual network B peering link (illustrated by blue arrow headed line), total number of subnets participating in the peering here's 4 (two from virtual network A and two from virtual network B side). This number should be <=400.

In the present release (feature remains behind subscription flag),forward route from non-peered subnet to peered subnet exists- In the current scenario virtual network A and virtual network B peering, even though Subnet 2 from virtual network A side isn't peered, but it will still have route for Subnet 1 and Subnet 2 in virtual network B.In the subnet peering for virtual network A and virtual network B, customer would expect only Subnet 1 and Subnet 3 from virtual network A to have route for Subnet 1 and Subnet 2 in remote virtual network B, however, Subnet 2 and Subnet 4 (from local side virtual network A which isn't peered) also have route for Subnet 1 and Subnet 2 in remote side (virtual network B), meaning the nonpeered subnets can send packet to destination node in the peered subnet, although the packet is dropped and doesn't reach the virtual machine.It's recommended that users apply NSGs on the participating subnets to allow traffic from only peered subnets/address spaces. This limitation will be removed in the post GA release.

Subnet Peering and AVNMConnected GroupIf two virtual networks are connected in 'Connected Group', and if Subnet peering is configured over these two virtual networks, subnet peering takes preference and the connectivity between nonpeered subnets gets dropped.AVNM Connectivity ConfigurationAVNM today can't differentiate between virtual network peering and subnet peering. If Subnet peering exists between virtual network A and virtual network B, and later an AVNM user tries to establish a virtual network peering between virtual network A and virtual network B through some AVNM connectivity configuration (Hub and Spoke deployment), AVNM would assume that peering between virtual network A and virtual network B already exists and would ignore the new peering request. We recommend that users exercise caution in such conflicting scenarios while using AVNM and Subnet peering

Next steps
Subnet peering helps you have better conservation of IPv4 space, by letting you reuse address spaces across subnets that need not be peered. It also prevents unnecessary exposure of entire virtual network address space through gateways to on-premises environments. With IPv6 only peering, you can further configure peering over IPv6 only for dual-stack subnets or IPv6 only subnets. Explore these capabilities and let us know if you have feedback and suggestions here.
