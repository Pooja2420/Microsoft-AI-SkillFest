Replicate and sync mainframe data to Azure
This example architecture outlines an implementation plan to replicate and sync data during modernization to Azure. It describes technical aspects like data stores, tools, and services.
Architecture

The diagram shows the flow of data from Db2 sources through Azure Data Factory pipelines to data storage, analytics, and BI services on Azure. The diagram has two areas, one for on-premises components and one for Azure components. The on-premises area has two rectangles. One rectangle pictures databases, such as Db2 zOS and Db2 LUW. An arrow points from these databases to the second rectangle, which lists integration tools. Arrows point from each integration tool to a component in the Azure section. Self-hosted integration runtime points to a box labeled "Dynamic pipeline." This box contains one parent pipeline and three child pipelines. An arrow points from these pipelines to a box that's labeled "Data storage, analytics, and BI." This box contains Azure services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Blob Storage. Dotted, double-sided arrows connect the dynamic pipeline pathway with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure Databricks. Arrows point from on-premises SQL Server integration services and non-Microsoft tools to the box labeled "Data storage, analytics, and BI" in the Azure section. The on-premises data gateway integration tool points to a data pipeline in Fabric Data Factory. An arrow points from this pipeline to the "Data storage, analytics, and BI" box.

Workflow
The following workflow corresponds to the previous diagram:
Mainframe and midrange systems update on-premises application databases at regular intervals. To maintain consistency, this solution syncs the latest data with Azure databases. The sync process involves the following steps.
Azure Data Factory dynamic pipelines orchestrate activities that range from data extraction to data loading. You can schedule pipeline activities, start them manually, or trigger them automatically.Pipelines group the activities that perform tasks. To extract data, Azure Data Factory dynamically creates one pipeline for each on-premises table. You can then use a massively parallel implementation when you replicate data in Azure. You can also configure the solution to meet your requirements:Full replication:You replicate the entire database and make the necessary modifications to data types and fields in the target Azure database.Partial, delta, or incremental replication:You useâ¯watermark columnsâ¯in source tables to sync the updated rows with Azure databases. These columns contain either a continuously incrementing key or a time stamp that indicates the table's last update.Azure Data Factory also uses pipelines for the following transformation tasks:Data-type conversionData manipulationData formattingColumn derivationData flatteningData sortingData filtering
