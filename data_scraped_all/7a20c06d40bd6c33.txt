Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)has several Azure built-in roles that you can assign to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. Role assignments are the way you control access to Azure resources. If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your ownAzure custom roles. For information about how to assign roles, seeSteps to assign an Azure role.
