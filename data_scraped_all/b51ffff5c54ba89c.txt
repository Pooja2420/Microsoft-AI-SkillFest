Applies to:Azure Logic Apps (Consumption + Standard)
This how-to guide shows how to start your workflow by adding atriggerand then continue your workflow by adding anaction. The trigger is always the first step in any workflow and specifies the condition to meet before your workflow can start to run. Following the trigger, you have to add one or more subsequent actions for your workflow to perform the tasks that you want. The trigger and actions work together to define your workflow's logic and structure.
This guide shows the steps for Consumption and Standard logic app workflows.
Prerequisites
An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription,sign up for a free Azure account.

To add a trigger, you have to start with a logic app resource and a blank workflow.

The following steps use the Azure portal, but you can also use the following tools to build a logic app workflow:
Consumption workflows:Visual Studio Code
Standard workflows:Visual Studio Code

Connectors, triggers, and actions in the designer
In the workflow designer, you can select from 1,400+ triggers and actions, collectively calledoperations. Azure Logic Apps organizes operations into either collections such asScheduleandData Operations, or as connectors such asAzure Blob StorageandSQL Server. Collections and connectors can include triggers, actions, or both.
When theAdd a triggerorAdd an actionpane opens, the gallery lists the available collections and connectors from left to right, based on popularity. After you select a collection or connector, the available triggers or actions appear in alphabetically in ascending order.
In-app (built-in) operations
The following Standard workflow example shows theIn-appcollections and connectors when you add a trigger:

After you select a collection or connector, triggers appear by collection or connector name.
The following example shows the selectedSchedulecollection and its triggers:

The following example shows theIn-appcollections and connectors when you add an action:

Shared (Azure) operations
The following Standard workflow example shows theSharedconnectors gallery when you add a trigger:

After you select a collection or connector, triggers appear by collection or connector name.
The following example shows the selected365 Trainingconnector and its triggers:
