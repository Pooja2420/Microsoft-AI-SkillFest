Organize your cloud-based resources to secure, manage, and track costs related to your workloads. To organize your resources, define a management group hierarchy, consider and follow a naming convention, and apply resource tagging.
Management levels and hierarchy
Azure provides four levels of management: management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources. The following diagram shows the relationship between these levels.

Management groupshelp you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

Subscriptionslogically associate user accounts with the resources they create. Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources it can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources created by users, teams, and projects.

Management settings scope
You can apply management settings, such as policies and role-based access control, at any management level. The level determines how widely the setting is applied. Lower levels inherit settings from higher levels. For example, when you apply a policy to a subscription, that policy applies to all resource groups and resources in that subscription, unless explicitly excluded.
Start with applying critical settings at higher levels and project-specific requirements at lower levels. For example, to make sure that all resources for your organization deploy to certain regions, apply a policy to the subscription that specifies the allowed regions. The allowed locations are automatically enforced when users in your organization add new resource groups and resources.
Tip
Use management groups to organize and govern your Azure subscriptions. As the number of your subscriptions increases, management groups provide critical structure to your Azure environment and make it easier to manage your subscriptions.

Naming standards
A good naming standard helps to identify resources in the Azure portal, on a billing statement, and in automation scripts. Your naming strategy should include business and operational details in resource names.
Business details should include the organizational information required to identify teams. For example a business unit, such asfin,mktg, orcorpmight be used.
fin
mktg
corp
Follow the guidance forabbreviations for resource types.
Use a consistent naming convention for all resources. For example, use a prefix that identifies the subscription or resource group, workload type, the environment the resource is deploy in, and the Azure region.
Operational details in resource names should include information that IT and workload teams need. Include details that identify the workload, application, environment, criticality, and other information that's useful for managing resources.
To learn more about naming Azure standards and recommendations, seeDevelop your naming and tagging strategy for Azure resources.
Note
Avoid using special characters, such as hyphen and underscore (-and_), as the first or last characters in a name. Doing so can cause validation rules to fail.

Names of tags are case-insensitive.
Resource tags
Tags can quickly identify your resources and resource groups. You apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organize them by categories. Tags can include context about the resource's associated workload or application, operational requirements, and ownership information.
Each tag consists of a name and a value. For example, you can apply the nameenvironmentand the valueproductionto all the resources in production.
After you apply tags, you can easily retrieve all the resources in your subscription that have that tag name and value. When you organize resources for billing or management, tags can help you retrieve related resources from different resource groups.
Other common uses for tags include:
Workload name:Name of the workload that a resource supports.
Data classification:Sensitivity of the data that a resource hosts.
Cost center:The accounting cost center or team associated with the resource. InMicrosoft Cost Management, you can apply your cost center tag as a filter to report charges based on usage by team or department.
Environment:The environment in which the resource is deployed, such as, development, test, or production.
For more tagging recommendations and examples, seeDefine your tagging strategy.
Apply a resource tag
To apply one or more tags to a resource group:
In the Azure portal, go toResource groupsand select the resource group.
SelectAssign tagsin the navigation at the top of the page.
Enter the name and value for a tag underNameandValue.
Enter more names and values or selectSave.
Remove a resource tag
To remove one or more tags from a resource group:
In the Azure portal, go toResource groupsand select the ellipses menu for the group, and then selectEdit tags.
Select the trash can icon for each tag that you want to remove.
To save your changes, selectSave.
