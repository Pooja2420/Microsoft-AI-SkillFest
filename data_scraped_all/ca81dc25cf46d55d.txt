Container soft delete protects your data from being accidentally or erroneously modified or deleted. When container soft delete is enabled for a storage account, a container and its contents may be recovered after it has been deleted, within a retention period that you specify. For more details about container soft delete, seeSoft delete for containers.
For end-to-end data protection, Microsoft recommends that you also enable soft delete for blobs and blob versioning. To learn how to also enable soft delete for blobs, seeEnable and manage soft delete for blobs. To learn how to enable blob versioning, seeBlob versioning.
Enable container soft delete
You can enable or disable container soft delete for the storage account at any time by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure Resource Manager template. Microsoft recommends setting the retention period for container soft delete to a minimum of seven days.

To enable container soft delete with PowerShell, first install theAz.Storagemodule, version 3.9.0 or later. Next, call theEnable-AzStorageContainerDeleteRetentionPolicycommand and specify the number of days for the retention period. Remember to replace the values in angle brackets with your own values:
Enable-AzStorageContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account> `
    -RetentionDays 7
Enable-AzStorageContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account> `
    -RetentionDays 7
To check the current settings for container soft delete, call theGet-AzStorageBlobServicePropertycommand:
$properties = Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account>
$properties.ContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy.Enabled
$properties.ContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy.Days
$properties = Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account>
$properties.ContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy.Enabled
$properties.ContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy.Days
To disable container soft delete, call theDisable-AzStorageContainerDeleteRetentionPolicycommand.
To enable container soft delete with Azure CLI, first install Azure CLI, version 2.26.0 or later. Next, call theaz storage account blob-service-properties updatecommand and specify the number of days for the retention period. Remember to replace the values in angle brackets with your own values:
az storage account blob-service-properties update \
    --enable-container-delete-retention true \
    --container-delete-retention-days 7 \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group>
az storage account blob-service-properties update \
    --enable-container-delete-retention true \
    --container-delete-retention-days 7 \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource_group>
To check the current settings for container soft delete, call theaz storage account blob-service-properties showcommand:
az storage account blob-service-properties show --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
az storage account blob-service-properties show --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
To disable container soft delete, specifyfalsefor the--enable-container-delete-retentionparameter.
false
--enable-container-delete-retention
To enable container soft delete with an Azure Resource Manager template, create a template that sets thecontainerDeleteRetentionPolicyproperty. The following steps describe how to create a template in the Azure portal.
In the Azure portal, chooseCreate a resource.
