In this article
In this tutorial, you use Azure Network Watchernext hoptool to troubleshoot and diagnose a VM routing problem that's preventing it from correctly communicating with other resources. Next hop shows you that acustom routecaused the routing problem.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network
Create two virtual machines
Test communication to different IPs using the next hop capability of Azure Network Watcher
View the effective routes
Create a custom route
Diagnose a routing problem
If you prefer, you can diagnose a virtual machine network routing problem using theAzure CLIorAzure PowerShellversions of the tutorial.

Create second virtual machine
Follow the previous steps (1-6) and usemyNVAfor the virtual machine name to create the second virtual machine.
Test network communication using Network Watcher next hop
Use the next hop capability of Network Watcher to determine which route Azure is using to route traffic frommyVM, which has one network interface with one IP configuration
In the search box at the top of the portal, enternetwork watcher. SelectNetwork Watcherfrom the search results.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enternetwork watcher. SelectNetwork Watcherfrom the search results.
UnderNetwork diagnostic tools, selectNext hop. Enter or select the following values:SettingValueSubscriptionSelect your Azure subscription.Resource groupSelectmyResourceGroup.Virtual machineSelectmyVM.Network interfaceLeave the default.Source IP addressEnter10.0.0.4or the IP of your VM if it's different.Destination IP addressEnter13.107.21.200to test the communication towww.bing.com.
UnderNetwork diagnostic tools, selectNext hop. Enter or select the following values:
www.bing.com
SelectNext hopbutton to start the test. The test result shows information about the next hop like the next hop type, its IP address, and the route table ID used to route traffic. The result of testing13.107.21.200shows that the next hop type isInternetand the route table ID isSystem Routewhich means traffic destined towww.bing.comfrommyVMis routed to the internet using Azure default system route.

Change theDestination IP addressto10.0.0.5which is the IP address ofmyNVAvirtual machine, and then selectNext hopbutton. The result shows that the next hop type isVirtualNetworkand the route table ID isSystem Routewhich means traffic destined to10.0.0.5frommyVMis routed withinmyVNetvirtual network using Azure default system route.

Next, change theDestination IP addressto10.1.0.5which is a private IP address that isn't in the address space ofmyVNetvirtual network, and then selectNext hopbutton. The result shows that the next hop type isNonewhich means traffic destined to10.1.0.5frommyVMis dropped.

To further analyze routing, review the effective routes formyVMnetwork interface.

UnderHelp, selectEffective routesto see the all routes associated with the network interface ofmyVM.In the previous section, when you ran the test using13.107.21.200, the route with 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix was used to route traffic to the address since no other route has the address. By default, all addresses not specified within the address prefix of another route are routed to the internet.When you ran the test using10.0.0.5, the route with 10.0.0.0/16 address prefix was used to route traffic to it.However, when you ran the test using10.1.0.5, the result wasNonefor the next hop type because this IP address is in the 10.0.0.0/8 address space. Azure default route for 10.0.0.0/8 address prefix has next hope type asNone. If you add an address prefix that contains 10.1.0.5 to the virtual network address space, then the next hop type for 10.1.0.5 will change fromNonetoVirtualNetwork.

Test a routing problem due to custom routes
Next, you create a static custom route to override Azure default system routes and cause a routing problem tomyVMvirtual machine that prevents it from directly communicating withwww.bing.com. Then, you'll use Network Watcher next hop to troubleshoot and diagnose the problem.

Create a custom route
In this section, you create a static custom route (user-defined route) in a route table that forces all traffic destined outside the virtual network to a specific IP address. Forcing traffic to a virtual network appliance is a common scenario.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterroute tables. SelectRoute tablesfrom the search results.

Associate the route table with the subnet
In this section, you associate the route table that you created in the previous section withmySubnetsubnet.
UnderSettings, selectSubnets, and then select+ Associateto associatemyRouteTablewithmySubnetsubnet.
UnderSettings, selectSubnets, and then select+ Associateto associatemyRouteTablewithmySubnetsubnet.

SelectOK.
Go towww.bing.com
www.bing.com
InmyVM, open the web browser and go towww.bing.comto verify if it's still reachable. The custom route that you created and associated with subnet ofmyVMforces the traffic to go tomyNVA. The traffic is dropped asmyNVAisn't set up to forward the traffic for the purposes of this tutorial to demonstrate a routing problem.

Test network communication using next hop
Repeat the steps you used inTest network communication using Network Watcher next hopsection using13.107.21.200to test the communication towww.bing.com.
www.bing.com

View effective routes
Repeat the steps you used inView details of a routeto check the effective routes after using the custom route that caused an issue in reachingwww.bing.com.
www.bing.com
The custom route with prefix 0.0.0.0/0 overrode Azure default route and caused all traffic destined outsidemyVNetvirtual machine to go to 10.0.0.5.

Note
In this tutorial, traffic towww.bing.comwas dropped becausemyNVAwas not set up to forward traffic. To learn how to set up a virtual machine to forward traffic, seeTurn on IP forwarding.
