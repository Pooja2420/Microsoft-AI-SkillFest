You can use an Azure network security group (NSG) to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group containssecurity rulesthat allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.
You can deploy resources from several Azure services into an Azure virtual network. For a complete list, seeServices that can be deployed into a virtual network. You can associate zero, or one, network security group to each virtual networksubnetandnetwork interfacein a virtual machine. The same network security group can be associated to as many subnets and network interfaces as you choose.
The following picture illustrates different scenarios for how network security groups might be deployed to allow network traffic to and from the internet over TCP port 80:

Refer to the preceding diagram to understand how Azure processes inbound and outbound rules. The picture illustrates how network security groups handle traffic filtering.
Inbound traffic
For inbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a subnet first, if there's one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the network interface, if there's one. This process includes intra-subnet traffic as well.
VM1:NSG1processes the security rules becauseNSG1is associated withSubnet1, andVM1resides inSubnet1. TheDenyAllInbounddefault security rule blocks the traffic unless a rule explicitly allows port 80 inbound. The network interface associated withNSG2doesn't evaluate the blocked traffic. However, ifNSG1allows port 80 in its security rule,NSG2then evaluates the traffic. To permit port 80 to the virtual machine, bothNSG1andNSG2must include a rule that allows port 80 from the internet.

VM2: The rules inNSG1are processed becauseVM2is also inSubnet1. SinceVM2doesn't have a network security group associated to its network interface, it receives all traffic allowed throughNSG1or is denied all traffic denied byNSG1. Traffic is either allowed or denied to all resources in the same subnet when a network security group is associated to a subnet.

Traffic is either allowed or denied to all resources in the same subnet when a network security group is associated to a subnet.
VM3: Since there's no network security group associated toSubnet2, traffic is allowed into the subnet and processed byNSG2, becauseNSG2is associated to the network interface attached toVM3.
VM3: Since there's no network security group associated toSubnet2, traffic is allowed into the subnet and processed byNSG2, becauseNSG2is associated to the network interface attached toVM3.
VM4: Traffic is blocked toVM4,because a network security group isn't associated toSubnet3, or the network interface in the virtual machine. All network traffic is blocked through a subnet and network interface if they don't have a network security group associated to them. The virtual machine with a Standard public IP address is secure by default. For traffic to flow from the internet, an NSG must be assigned to the subnet or NIC of the virtual machine.

Outbound traffic
For outbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a network interface first, if there's one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the subnet, if there's one. This process includes intra-subnet traffic as well.
VM1: The security rules inNSG2are processed. TheAllowInternetOutbounddefault security rule in bothNSG1andNSG2allows the traffic unless you create a security rule that denies port 80 outbound to the internet. IfNSG2denies port 80 in its security rule, it denies the traffic, andNSG1never evaluates it. To deny port 80 from the virtual machine, either, or both of the network security groups must have a rule that denies port 80 to the internet.

TheAllowInternetOutbounddefault security rule in bothNSG1andNSG2allows the traffic unless you create a security rule that denies port 80 outbound to the internet.

To deny port 80 from the virtual machine, either, or both of the network security groups must have a rule that denies port 80 to the internet.
VM2: All traffic is sent through the network interface to the subnet, since the network interface attached toVM2doesn't have a network security group associated to it. The rules inNSG1are processed.

VM3: IfNSG2denies port 80 in its security rule, it denies the traffic. IfNSG2doesn't deny port 80, theAllowInternetOutbounddefault security rule inNSG2allows the traffic because there's no network security group associated withSubnet2.
VM3: IfNSG2denies port 80 in its security rule, it denies the traffic. IfNSG2doesn't deny port 80, theAllowInternetOutbounddefault security rule inNSG2allows the traffic because there's no network security group associated withSubnet2.
VM4: All network traffic is allowed fromVM4,because a network security group isn't associated to the network interface attached to the virtual machine, or toSubnet3.

Intra-Subnet traffic
It's important to note that security rules in an NSG associated to a subnet can affect connectivity between VMs within it. By default, virtual machines in the same subnet can communicate based on a default NSG rule allowing intra-subnet traffic. If you add a rule toNSG1that denies all inbound and outbound traffic,VM1andVM2can't communicate with each other.
You can easily view the aggregate rules applied to a network interface by viewing theeffective security rulesfor a network interface. You can also use theIP flow verifycapability in Azure Network Watcher to determine whether communication is allowed to or from a network interface. You can use IP flow verify to determine whether a communication is allowed or denied. Additionally, Use IP flow verify to surface the identity of the network security rule responsible for allowing or denying the traffic.
Tip
Unless you have a specific reason to, we recommend that you associate a network security group to a subnet, or a network interface, but not both. Rules in a network security group associated to a subnet can conflict with rules in a network security group associated to a network interface. You might have unexpected communication problems that require troubleshooting.
