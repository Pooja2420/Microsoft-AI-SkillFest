string
current
specific
current
Downloads artifacts produced by the current pipeline run or from a specific pipeline run.
project-Projectstring. Required whensource == specific.
project
string
source == specific
Specifies the project name or GUID from which to download the pipeline artifacts.
definition-Build pipelineInput alias:pipeline.string. Required whensource == specific.
definition
pipeline
string
source == specific
The definition ID of the pipeline. In a running pipeline thedefinitionIdcan be found in theSystem.DefinitionIdvariable. ThedefinitionIdcan also be retrieved from the URL on the pipeline overview page in the Azure DevOps portal. In the following URL example, thedefinitionIdis 78:https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam-inc/FabrikamFiber/_build?definitionId=78&_a=summary. To download artifacts from a specific pipeline definition, capture thedefinitionIdfrom that pipeline, and specify it as thepipelineparameter.

itemPattern-Matching patternsInput alias:patterns.string. Default value:**.
itemPattern
patterns
string

targetPath
path | downloadPath
string
$(Pipeline.Workspace)
Specifies either a relative or absolute path on the agent machine where the artifacts will download. If the multi-download option is applied (by leaving an empty artifact name), a sub-directory will be created for each download. Learn more aboutArtifacts in Azure Pipelines.
