Azure Government supports applications that use Impact Level 5 (IL5) data in all available regions. IL5 requirements are defined in theUS Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG). IL5 workloads have a higher degree of impact to the DoD and must be secured to a higher standard. When you deploy these workloads on Azure Government, you can meet their isolation requirements in various ways. The guidance in this document addresses configurations and settings needed to meet the IL5 isolation requirements. We'll update this article as we enable new isolation options and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) authorizes new services for IL5 data.
Background
In January 2017, DISA awarded theIL5 Provisional Authorization(PA) toAzure Government, making it the first IL5 PA awarded to a hyperscale cloud provider. The PA covered two Azure Government regions US DoD Central and US DoD East (US DoD regions) that arededicated to the DoD. Based on DoD mission owner feedback and evolving security capabilities, Microsoft has partnered with DISA to expand the IL5 PA boundary in December 2018 to cover the remaining Azure Government regions US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, and US Gov Virginia (US Gov regions). For service availability in Azure Government, seeProducts available by region.
For a list of services in scope for DoD IL5 PA in US Gov regions, seeAzure Government services by audit scope.
For a list of services in scope for DoD IL5 PA in US DoD regions, seeAzure Government DoD regions IL5 audit scope.
Azure Government is available to US federal, state, local, and tribal governments and their partners. The IL5 expansion to Azure Government honors the isolation requirements mandated by the DoD. Azure Government continues to provide more PaaS services suitable for DoD IL5 workloads than any other cloud services environment.
Principles and approach
You need to address two key areas for Azure services in IL5 scope: compute isolation and storage isolation. We'll focus in this article on how Azure services can help you isolate the compute and storage services for IL5 data. The SRG allows for a shared management and network infrastructure.This article is focused on Azure Government compute and storage isolation approaches for US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, and US Gov Virginia regions (US Gov regions).If an Azure service is available in Azure Government DoD regions US DoD Central and US DoD East (US DoD regions) and authorized at IL5, then it is by default suitable for IL5 workloads with no extra isolation configuration required. Azure Government DoD regions are reserved for DoD agencies and their partners, enabling physical separation from non-DoD tenants by design. For more information, seeDoD in Azure Government.
Important
You are responsible for designing and deploying your applications to meet DoD IL5 compliance requirements. In doing so, you should not include sensitive or restricted information in Azure resource names, as explained inConsiderations for naming Azure resources.
Compute isolation
IL5 separation requirements are stated in Section 5.2.2.3 (Page 51) of theCloud Computing SRG. The SRG focuses on compute separation during "processing" of IL5 data. This separation ensures that a virtual machine that could potentially compromise the physical host can't affect a DoD workload. To remove the risk of runtime attacks and ensure long running workloads aren't compromised from other workloads on the same host,all IL5 virtual machines and virtual machine scale setsshould be isolated by DoD mission owners viaAzure Dedicated Hostorisolated virtual machines. Doing so provides a dedicated physical server to host your Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) for Windows and Linux.
For services where the compute processes are obfuscated from access by the owner and stateless in their processing of data, you should accomplish isolation by focusing on the data being processed and how it's stored and retained. This approach ensures the data is stored in protected mediums. It also ensures the data isn't present on these services for extended periods unless it's encrypted as needed.
Storage isolation
The DoD requirements for encrypting data at rest are provided in Section 5.11 (Page 122) of theCloud Computing SRG. DoD emphasizes encrypting all data at rest stored in virtual machine virtual hard drives, mass storage facilities at the block or file level, and database records where the mission owner doesn't have sole control over the database service. For cloud applications where encrypting data at rest with DoD key control isn't possible, mission owners must perform a risk analysis with relevant data owners before transmitting data into a cloud service offering.
In a recent PA for Azure Government, DISA approved logical separation of IL5 from other data via cryptographic means. In Azure, this approach involves data encryption via keys that are maintained in Azure Key Vault and stored inFIPS 140 validatedHardware Security Modules (HSMs). The keys are owned and managed by the IL5 system owner, also known as customer-managed keys (CMK).
Here's how this approach applies to services:
If a service hosts only IL5 data, the service can control the key for end users. But it must use a dedicated key to protect IL5 data from all other data in the cloud.
If a service will host IL5 and non-DoD data, the service must expose the option for end users to use their own encryption keys that are maintained in Azure Key Vault. This implementation gives consumers of the service the ability to implement cryptographic separation as needed.
This approach ensures all key material for decrypting data is stored separately from the data itself using a hardware-based key management solution.
Applying this guidance
IL5 guidelines require workloads to be deployed with a high degree of security, isolation, and control. The following configurations are requiredin additionto any other configurations or controls needed to meet IL5 requirements. Network isolation, access controls, and other necessary security measures aren't necessarily addressed in this article.
Note
This article tracks Azure services that have received DoD IL5 PA and that require extra configuration options to meet IL5 isolation requirements. Services with IL5 PA that do not require any extra configuration options are not mentioned in this article. For a list of services in scope for DoD IL5 PA in US Gov regions, seeAzure Government services by audit scope.
Be sure to review the entry for each service you're using and ensure that all isolation requirements are implemented.

Virtual machinesandvirtual machine scale sets
You can use Azure virtual machines with multiple deployment mediums. You can do so for single virtual machines and for virtual machines deployed via the Azure virtual machine scale sets feature.
All virtual machines should use Disk Encryption for virtual machines or Disk Encryption for virtual machine scale sets, or place virtual machine disks in a storage account that can hold Impact Level 5 data as described in theAzure Storage section.
Important
When you deploy VMs in Azure Government regions US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, and US Gov Virginia, you must use Azure Dedicated Host, as described in the next section.
Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers that can host one or more virtual machines and that are dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our datacenters, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. You can then place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration meets your needs.
These VMs provide the necessary level of isolation required to support IL5 workloads when deployed outside of the dedicated DoD regions. When you use Dedicated Host, your Azure VMs are placed on an isolated and dedicated physical server that runs only your organizationâs workloads to meet compliance guidelines and standards.
Current Dedicated Host SKUs (VM series and Host Type) that offer the required compute isolation include SKUs in the VM families listed on theDedicated Host pricing page.
Virtual machine scale sets aren't currently supported on Azure Dedicated Host. But specific VM types, when deployed, consume the entire physical host for the VM. Isolated VM types can be deployed via virtual machine scale sets to provide proper compute isolation with all the benefits of virtual machine scale sets in place. When you configure your scale set, select the appropriate SKU. To encrypt the data at rest, see the next section for supportable encryption options.
Important
As new hardware generations become available, some VM types might require reconfiguration (scale up or migration to a new VM SKU) to ensure they remain on properly dedicated hardware. For more information, seeVirtual machine isolation in Azure.
You can encrypt the storage that supports these virtual machines in one of two ways to support necessary encryption standards.
Use Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt the drives by using dm-crypt (Linux) or BitLocker (Windows):Enable Azure Disk Encryption for LinuxEnable Azure Disk Encryption for Windows
Enable Azure Disk Encryption for Linux

Azure Storage
Azure Storage consists of multiple data features: Blob storage, File storage, Table storage, and Queue storage. Blob storage supports both standard and premium storage. Premium storage uses only SSDs, to provide the fastest performance possible. Storage also includes configurations that modify these storage types, like hot and cool to provide appropriate speed-of-availability for data scenarios.
Blob storage and File storage always use the account encryption key to encrypt data. Queue storage and Table storage can beoptionally configuredto encrypt data with the account encryption key when the storage account is created. You can opt to use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest in all Azure Storage features, including Blob, File, Table, and Queue storage. When you use an Azure Storage account, you must follow the steps below to ensure the data is protected with customer-managed keys.
To implement Impact Level 5 compliant controls on an Azure Storage account that runs in Azure Government outside of the dedicated DoD regions, you must use encryption at rest with the customer-managed key option enabled. The customer-managed key option is also known asbring your own key.
For more information about how to enable this Azure Storage encryption feature, seeConfigure encryption with customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.
Note
When you use this encryption method, you need to enable it before you add content to the storage account. Any content that's added before the customer-managed key is configured will be protected with Microsoft-managed keys.
StorSimple
To help ensure the security and integrity of data moved to the cloud, StorSimple allows you todefine cloud storage encryption keys. You specify the cloud storage encryption key when you create a volume container.
