Access levels in Azure DevOps control which web portal features are available or not. Access levels supplement security groups, which allow or deny specific tasks. Administrators ensure that their user base has access to the features they need and only pay for those specific features. Itâs an efficient way to manage costs while providing the necessary functionality to users. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick referenceandManage users and access.
Important

Select the version of this article that corresponds to your platform and version. The version selector is above the table of contents.Look up your Azure DevOps platform and version.
When you add a user or group to a team or project, they automatically gain access to the features associated with the default access level and security group. For most users, assigning them to theBasicaccess level and theContributorssecurity group provides access to most features. For a simplified overview of the permissions assigned to the most common groupsReaders,Contributors, andProject Administrators, seeDefault permissions.
Supported access levels
Assign users or groups of users to one of the following access levels:
Basic: Provides access to most features. Assign to users with a Visual Studio Professional subscription, an Azure DevOps Server CAL, and to users for whom you're paying for Basic access in an organization.
Basic + Test Plans: Provides access to all features included inBasicand Azure Test Plans. Assign to users with a Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms subscription, and to users for whom you're paying for Basic + Test Plans access in an organization.
Stakeholder: Provides limited access to private projects and nearly full access to public projects. Assign to an unlimited number of users without requiring a license or subscription, ideal for those needing access to a restricted set of features. Stakeholders can perform various, including viewing work items, participating in discussion, and accessing dashboards.
Visual Studio subscriber: Assign to users who already have a Visual Studio subscription. The system automatically recognizes the user's subscriptionâVisual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Professional, Visual Studio Test Professional, or MSDN Platformâand enables any other features included in their subscription level. If you assignBasicorStakeholder, they also receive their Visual Studio subscription benefits upon sign-in.TipAs a best practice when adding new users, we recommend assigning theVisual Studio Subscriberlevel when appropriate (as opposed to Basic) to prevent being charged theBasicrate before the user signs in for the first time.

GitHub Enterprise: The system automatically recognizes users with a GitHub Enterprise license the next time they sign in to Azure DevOps. Regardless of a user's assigned access level (for example, they could be assignedStakeholderaccess), they receiveBasicaccess when they're associated with a GitHub Enterprise license.
Stakeholder: Provides partial access, can assign to unlimited users for free. Assign to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features.
Basic: Provides access to most features. Assign to users with an Azure DevOps Server CAL, with a Visual Studio Professional subscription, and to users for whom you're paying for Basic access in an organization.
Basic + Test Plans: Provides access for users who have a monthly Test Manager subscription, Visual Studio Test Professional, or MSDN Platforms subscription.
VS Enterprise: Provides access to premium features. Assign to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise.
The following table indicates those features available for each supported access level. Visual Studio Test Professional and MSDN Platform subscriptions grant access to the same features as Visual Studio Enterprise.

The system automatically recognizes their subscription and enables any other features included, based on their subscription level.
VS Enterprise access
Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers getVS Enterpriseaccess as a subscriber benefit. When you add those users, be sure to assign them theVS Enterpriseaccess level.
With Visual Studio Enterprise (VS Enterprise) access, users gain access to any fee-based, Marketplace extension published by Microsoft that is included for active Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers.
Advanced access gives users all the Basic features, plusweb-based test case management tools. You canbuy monthly accessor add users who already have a Visual Studio Test Professional with MSDN or MSDN Platforms subscription.

Programmatic mapping of access levels
You can manage access levels programmatically using theaz devops user add(Azure DevOps Services only)or theUser Entitlement - Add REST API. The following table provides a mapping of the access level selected through the user interface and theAccountLicenseType,licensingSource, andmsdnLicenseTypeparameters.

What features are available to users who added to two different access levels?
If a user belongs to a group that hasBasicaccess and another group that hasVS Enterpriseaccess, the user has access to all features available throughVS Enterprise, which is a superset ofBasic.
Service account access
Azure DevOpsservice accountsadded to the default access level. If you make Stakeholder the default access level, you must add the service accounts to Basic or Advanced/VS Enterprise access.
Service accounts don't require a CAL or other purchase.
