Microsoft Entra Domain Services provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, Kerberos/NTLM authentication that is fully compatible with Windows Server Active Directory. With a Domain Services managed domain, you can provide domain join features and management to virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. This tutorial shows you how to create a Windows Server VM then join it to a managed domain.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a Windows Server VM
Connect the Windows Server VM to an Azure virtual network
Join the VM to the managed domain
If you don't have an Azure subscription,create an accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources:
An active Azure subscription.If you don't have an Azure subscription,create an account.

If you already have a VM that you want to domain-join, skip to the section tojoin the VM to the managed domain.
Sign in to the Azure portal
In this tutorial, you create a Windows Server VM to join to your managed domain using the Azure portal. To get started, first sign in to theAzure portal.
Create a Windows Server virtual machine
To see how to join a computer to a managed domain, let's create a Windows Server VM. This VM is connected to an Azure virtual network that provides connectivity to the managed domain. The process to join a managed domain is the same as joining a regular on-premises Active Directory Domain Services domain.
If you already have a VM that you want to domain-join, skip to the section tojoin the VM to the managed domain.

By default, VMs created in Azure are accessible from the Internet using RDP. When RDP is enabled, automated sign-in attacks are likely to occur, which may disable accounts with common names such asadminoradministratordue to multiple failed successive sign-in attempts.RDP should only be enabled when required, and limited to a set of authorized IP ranges. This configuration helps improve the security of the VM and reduces the area for potential attack. Or, create and use an Azure Bastion host that allows access only through the Microsoft Entra admin center over TLS. In the next step of this tutorial, you use an Azure Bastion host to securely connect to the VM.UnderPublic inbound ports, selectNone.

Your VM must connect to an Azure virtual network subnet that can communicate with the subnet your managed domain is deployed into. We recommend that a managed domain is deployed into its own dedicated subnet. Don't deploy your VM in the same subnet as your managed domain.There are two main ways to deploy your VM and connect to an appropriate virtual network subnet:Create a, or select an existing, subnet in the same the virtual network as your managed domain is deployed.Select a subnet in an Azure virtual network that is connected to it usingAzure virtual network peering.If you select a virtual network subnet that isn't connected to the subnet for your managed domain, you can't join the VM to the managed domain. For this tutorial, let's create a new subnet in the Azure virtual network.In theNetworkingpane, select the virtual network in which your managed domain is deployed, such asaaads-vnet

In the left-hand menu of the virtual network window, selectAddress space. The virtual network is created with a single address space of10.0.2.0/24, which is used by the default subnet. Other subnets, such as forworkloadsor Azure Bastion may also already exist.Add an additional IP address range to the virtual network. The size of this address range and the actual IP address range to use depends on other network resources already deployed. The IP address range shouldn't overlap with any existing address ranges in your Azure or on-premises environment. Make sure that you size the IP address range large enough for the number of VMs you expect to deploy into the subnet.In the following example, an additional IP address range of10.0.5.0/24is added. When ready, selectSave.

It takes a few minutes to create the VM. The Microsoft Entra admin center shows the status of the deployment. Once the VM is ready, selectGo to resource.

Connect to the Windows Server VM
To securely connect to your VMs, use an Azure Bastion host. With Azure Bastion, a managed host is deployed into your virtual network and provides web-based RDP or SSH connections to VMs. No public IP addresses are required for the VMs, and you don't need to open network security group rules for external remote traffic. You connect to VMs using the Microsoft Entra admin center from your web browser. If needed,create an Azure Bastion host.
To use a Bastion host to connect to your VM, complete the following steps:
In theOverviewpane for your VM, selectConnect, thenBastion.
In theOverviewpane for your VM, selectConnect, thenBastion.

Enter the credentials for your VM that you specified in the previous section, then selectConnect.
Enter the credentials for your VM that you specified in the previous section, then selectConnect.

If needed, allow your web browser to open pop-ups for the Bastion connection to be displayed. It takes a few seconds to make the connection to your VM.
Join the VM to the managed domain
With the VM created and a web-based RDP connection established using Azure Bastion, now let's join the Windows Server virtual machine to the managed domain. This process is the same as a computer connecting to a regular on-premises Active Directory Domain Services domain.

Enter domain credentials to join the domain. Provide credentials for a user that's a part of the managed domain. The account must be part of the managed domain or Microsoft Entra tenant - accounts from external directories associated with your Microsoft Entra tenant can't correctly authenticate during the domain-join process.Account credentials can be specified in one of the following ways:UPN format(recommended) - Enter the user principal name (UPN) suffix for the user account, as configured in Microsoft Entra ID. For example, the UPN suffix of the usercontosoadminwould becontosoadmin@aaddscontoso.onmicrosoft.com. There are a couple of common use-cases where the UPN format can be used reliably to sign in to the domain rather than theSAMAccountNameformat:If a user's UPN prefix is long, such asdeehasareallylongname, theSAMAccountNamemay be autogenerated.If multiple users have the same UPN prefix in your Microsoft Entra tenant, such asdee, theirSAMAccountNameformat might be autogenerated.SAMAccountName format- Enter the account name in theSAMAccountNameformat. For example, theSAMAccountNameof usercontosoadminwould beAADDSCONTOSO\contosoadmin.

Tip
You can domain-join a VM using PowerShell with theAdd-Computercmdlet. The following example joins theAADDSCONTOSOdomain and then restarts the VM. When prompted, enter the credentials for a user that's a part of the managed domain:
Add-Computer -DomainName AADDSCONTOSO -Restart
Add-Computer -DomainName AADDSCONTOSO -Restart
To domain-join a VM without connecting to it and manually configuring the connection, you can use theSet-AzVmAdDomainExtensionAzure PowerShell cmdlet.
Once the Windows Server VM has restarted, any policies applied in the managed domain are pushed to the VM. You can also now sign in to the Windows Server VM using appropriate domain credentials.
Clean up resources
In the next tutorial, you use this Windows Server VM to install the management tools that let you administer the managed domain. If you don't want to continue in this tutorial series, review the following clean up steps todelete the VM. Otherwise,continue to the next tutorial.
Unjoin the VM from the managed domain
To remove the VM from the managed domain, follow through the steps again tojoin the VM to a domain. Instead of joining the managed domain, choose to join a workgroup, such as the defaultWORKGROUP. After the VM has rebooted, the computer object is removed from the managed domain.
If youdelete the VMwithout unjoining from the domain, an orphaned computer object is left in Domain Services.
Delete the VM
If you're not going use this Windows Server VM, delete the VM using the following steps:
From the left-hand menu, selectResource groups
Choose your resource group, such asmyResourceGroup.
Choose your VM, such asmyVM, then selectDelete. SelectYesto confirm the resource deletion. It takes a few minutes to delete the VM.
When the VM is deleted, select the OS disk, network interface card, and any other resources with themyVM-prefix and delete them.
Troubleshoot domain-join issues
The Windows Server VM should successfully join to the managed domain, the same way as a regular on-premises computer would join an Active Directory Domain Services domain. If the Windows Server VM can't join the managed domain, that indicates there's a connectivity or credentials-related issue. Review the following troubleshooting sections to successfully join the managed domain.
Connectivity issues
If you don't receive a prompt that asks for credentials to join the domain, there's a connectivity problem. The VM can't reach the managed domain on the virtual network.
After trying each of these troubleshooting steps, try to join the Windows Server VM to the managed domain again.
Verify the VM is connected to the same virtual network that Domain Services is enabled in, or has a peered network connection.
Try to ping the DNS domain name of the managed domain, such asping aaddscontoso.com.If the ping request fails, try to ping the IP addresses for the managed domain, such asping 10.0.0.4. The IP address for your environment is displayed on thePropertiespage when you select the managed domain from your list of Azure resources.If you can ping the IP address but not the domain, DNS may be incorrectly configured. Confirm that the IP addresses of the managed domain are configured as DNS servers for the virtual network.
ping aaddscontoso.com
If the ping request fails, try to ping the IP addresses for the managed domain, such asping 10.0.0.4. The IP address for your environment is displayed on thePropertiespage when you select the managed domain from your list of Azure resources.
ping 10.0.0.4
If you can ping the IP address but not the domain, DNS may be incorrectly configured. Confirm that the IP addresses of the managed domain are configured as DNS servers for the virtual network.
Try to flush the DNS resolver cache on the virtual machine using theipconfig /flushdnscommand.
ipconfig /flushdns
Credentials-related issues
If you receive a prompt that asks for credentials to join the domain, but then an error after you enter those credentials, the VM is able to connect to the managed domain. The credentials you provided don't then let the VM join the managed domain.
After trying each of these troubleshooting steps, try to join the Windows Server VM to the managed domain again.
Make sure that the user account you specify belongs to the managed domain.
Confirm that the account is part of the managed domain or Microsoft Entra tenant. Accounts from external directories associated with your Microsoft Entra tenant can't correctly authenticate during the domain-join process.
Try using the UPN format to specify credentials, such ascontosoadmin@aaddscontoso.onmicrosoft.com. If there are many users with the same UPN prefix in your tenant or if your UPN prefix is overly long, theSAMAccountNamefor your account may be autogenerated. In these cases, theSAMAccountNameformat for your account may be different from what you expect or use in your on-premises domain.
contosoadmin@aaddscontoso.onmicrosoft.com
Check that you haveenabled password synchronizationto your managed domain. Without this configuration step, the required password hashes won't be present in the managed domain to correctly authenticate your sign-in attempt.
Wait for password synchronization to be completed. When a user account's password is changed, an automatic background synchronization from Microsoft Entra ID updates the password in Domain Services. It takes some time for the password to be available for domain-join use.
