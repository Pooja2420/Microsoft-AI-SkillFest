Managed Identity authenticationfor output to Azure Blob storage gives Stream Analytics jobs direct access to a storage account instead of using a connection string. In addition to improved security, this feature also enables you to write data to a storage account in a Virtual Network (VNET) within Azure.
This article shows you how to enable Managed Identity for the Blob output(s) of a Stream Analytics job through the Azure portal and through an Azure Resource Manager deployment.
Create the Stream Analytics job using the Azure portal
First, you create a managed identity for your Azure Stream Analytics job.â¯
In theâ¯Azure portal, open your Azure Stream Analytics job.â¯
In theâ¯Azure portal, open your Azure Stream Analytics job.â¯
Fromâ¯theâ¯leftâ¯navigationâ¯menu, selectâ¯Managed Identityâ¯located underâ¯Configure. Then, check the box next toâ¯Useâ¯System-assigned Managed Identityâ¯and selectâ¯Save.â¯
Fromâ¯theâ¯leftâ¯navigationâ¯menu, selectâ¯Managed Identityâ¯located underâ¯Configure. Then, check the box next toâ¯Useâ¯System-assigned Managed Identityâ¯and selectâ¯Save.
â¯
A service principal for the Stream Analytics job's identity is created inâ¯Microsoft Entra ID. The life cycle of the newly created identity is managed byâ¯Azure. When the Stream Analytics job is deleted, the associated identity (that is, the service principal) is automatically deleted by Azure.â¯When you save the configuration, the Object ID (OID) of the service principal is listed as the Principal ID as shown below:â¯The service principal has the same name as the Stream Analytics job. For example, if the name of your job isâ¯MyASAJob, the name of the service principal is alsoâ¯MyASAJob.â¯

Azure Resource Manager deployment
Using Azure Resource Manager allows you to fully automate the deployment of your Stream Analytics job. You can deploy Resource Manager templates using either Azure PowerShell or theAzure CLI. The below examples use the Azure CLI.
You can create aMicrosoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobsresource with a Managed Identity by including the following property in the resource section of your Resource Manager template:"Identity": {
  "Type": "SystemAssigned",
},This property tells Azure Resource Manager to create and manage the identity for your Stream Analytics job. Below is an example Resource Manager template that deploys a Stream Analytics job with Managed Identity enabled and a Blob output sink that uses Managed Identity:{

                                        { "accountName": "MyStorageAccount" }
                                    ],
                                    "container": "test",

                ]
            }
        }
    ]

Take note of theprincipalIdfrom the job's definition, which identifies your job's Managed Identity within Microsoft Entra ID and will be used in the next step to grant the Stream Analytics job access to the storage account.
Now that the job is created, see theGive the Stream Analytics job access to your storage accountsection of this article.
Now that the job is created, see theGive the Stream Analytics job access to your storage accountsection of this article.
Give the Stream Analytics job access to your storage account
There are two levels of access you can choose to give your Stream Analytics job:
Container level access:this option gives the job access to a specific existing container.
Account level access:this option gives the job general access to the storage account, including the ability to create new containers.
Unless you need the job to create containers on your behalf, you should chooseContainer level accesssince this option will grant the job the minimum level of access required. Both options are explained below for the Azure portal and the command-line.
Note
Due to global replication or caching latency, there may be a delay when permissions are revoked or granted. Changes should be reflected within 8 minutes.

Grant access via the command line
To give access to a specific container, run the following command using the Azure CLI:
az role assignment create --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --assignee <principal-id> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>
az role assignment create --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --assignee <principal-id> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>
To give access to the entire account, run the following command using the Azure CLI:
az role assignment create --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --assignee <principal-id> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>
az role assignment create --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --assignee <principal-id> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>
Create a blob input or outputâ¯
Now that your managed identity is configured, you're ready to add theâ¯blob resourceâ¯as an input or output to your Stream Analytics job.
In the output properties window of the Azure Blob storage output sink, select the Authentication mode drop-down and chooseManaged Identity. For information regarding the other output properties, seeUnderstand outputs from Azure Stream Analytics. When you are finished, clickSave.

Enable VNET access
When configuring your storage account'sFirewalls and virtual networks, you can optionally allow in network traffic from other trusted Microsoft services. When Stream Analytics authenticates using Managed Identity, it provides proof that the request is originating from a trusted service. Below are instructions to enable this VNET access exception.
Navigate to the "Firewalls and virtual networks" pane within the storage account's configuration pane.
Ensure the "Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account" option is enabled.
If you enabled it, clickSave.

Remove Managed Identity
The Managed Identity created for a Stream Analytics job is deleted only when the job is deleted. There is no way to delete the Managed Identity without deleting the job. If you no longer want to use the Managed Identity, you can change the authentication method for the output. The Managed Identity will continue to exist until the job is deleted, and will be used if you decide to used Managed Identity authentication again.
Limitations
Below are the current limitations of this feature:
Classic Azure Storage accounts.
Classic Azure Storage accounts.
Azure accounts without Microsoft Entra ID.

Multi-tenant access is not supported. The Service principal created for a given Stream Analytics job must reside in the same Microsoft Entra tenant in which the job was created, and cannot be used with a resource that resides in a different Microsoft Entra tenant.
