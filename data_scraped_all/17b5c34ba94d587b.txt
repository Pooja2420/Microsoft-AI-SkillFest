Configure virtual network peering between two virtual networks
Are the virtual networks in the same subscription or in different subscriptions?
The virtual networks are in the same subscription
To configure virtual network peering for the virtual networks that are in the same subscription, use the methods in the following articles:
If the virtual networks are in thesame region, seeCreate a peering.
If the virtual networks are in thedifferent regions, seeVirtual network peering.
Note
Connectivity doesn't work over global virtual network peering for the following resources:
Virtual machines (VMs) behind Basic internal load balancer (ILB) SKU
Redis cache (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Application gateway v1 (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Virtual machine scale sets (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Azure Service Fabric clusters (uses Basic ILB SKU)
SQL Server Always On (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Azure App Service Environment for Power Apps (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Azure API Management (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Microsoft Entra Domain Services (uses Basic ILB SKU)
For more information, see therequirements and constraintsof global peering.
The virtual networks are in different subscriptions or Active Directory tenants
To configure virtual network peering for virtual networks in different subscriptions or Active Directory tenants, seeCreate a virtual network peering between different subscriptions.
Note
To configure network peering, you must haveNetwork Contributorpermissions in both subscriptions. For more information, seePeering permissions.
Configure virtual network peering with hub-spoke topology that uses on-premises resources

For a site-to-site connection or an ExpressRoute connection
Follow the steps in:Configure VPN gateway transit for virtual network peering.
For point-to-site connections
Follow the steps in:Configure VPN gateway transit for virtual network peering.
After virtual network peering is established or changed, download and reinstall the point-to-site package so that the point-to-site clients get the updated routes to the spoke virtual network.
Configure virtual network peering with hub-spoke topology virtual network

The virtual networks are in the same region
In the hub virtual network, configure a network virtual appliance (NVA).
In the spoke virtual networks, have user-defined routes with the next hop type "network virtual appliance" applied.
For more information, seeService chaining.
Note
If you require help to set up an NVA,contact the NVA vendor.
For help with troubleshooting the NVA device setup and routing, seeNetwork virtual appliance issues in Azure.
The virtual networks are in different regions
Transit over global virtual network peering is now supported. Connectivity does not work over global virtual network peering for the following resources:
VMs behind Basic ILB SKU
Redis cache (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Application gateway (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Scale sets (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Service Fabric clusters (uses Basic ILB SKU)
SQL Server Always On (uses Basic ILB SKU)
App Service Environment (uses Basic ILB SKU)
API Management (uses Basic ILB SKU)
Microsoft Entra Domain Services (uses Basic ILB SKU)

Troubleshoot a connectivity issue between two peered virtual networks
Sign in to theAzure portalwith an account that has the necessaryroles and permissions. Select the virtual network, selectPeering, and then check theStatusfield. What is the status?
The peering status is "Connected"
To troubleshoot this issue:
Check the network traffic flows:UseConnection TroubleshootandIP flow verifyfrom the source VM to the destination VM to determine whether there is an NSG or UDR that is causing interference in traffic flows.If you're using a firewall or NVA:Document the UDR parameters so that you can restore them after this step is complete.Remove the UDR from the source VM subnet or NIC that points to the NVA as the next hop. Verify connectivity from the source VM directly to the destination that is bypassing the NVA. If this step doesn't work, see theNVA troubleshooter.

The peering status is "Disconnected"
To resolve this issue, delete the peering from both virtual networks, and then re-create them.
Troubleshoot a connectivity issue between a hub-spoke virtual network and an on-premises resource
Does your network use a third-party NVA or VPN gateway?
My network uses a third-party NVA or VPN gateway
To troubleshoot connectivity issues that affect a third-party NVA or VPN gateway, see the following articles:

My network does not use a third-party NVA or VPN gateway
Do the hub virtual network and the spoke virtual network have a VPN gateway?
Using a remote gateway isn't supported.
If the spoke virtual network already has a VPN gateway, theUse remote gatewayoption isn't supported on the spoke virtual network. This is because of a virtual network peering limitation.
For site-to-site or Azure ExpressRoute connections, check the following primary causes of connectivity issues to the remote virtual network from on-premises:
On the virtual network that has a gateway, verify that theAllow forwarded trafficcheck box is selected.
On the virtual network that doesn't have a gateway, verify that theUse remote gatewaycheck box is selected.
Have your network administrator check your on-premises devices to verify that they all have the remote virtual network address space added.
For point-to-site connections:
On the virtual network that has a gateway, verify that theAllow forwarded trafficcheck box is selected.
On the virtual network that doesn't have a gateway, verify that theUse remote gatewaycheck box is selected.
Download and reinstall the point-to-site client package. Virtual network routes that are newly peered don't automatically add routes to point-to-site clients.
Troubleshoot a hub-spoke network connectivity issue between spoke virtual networks in the same region
A hub network must include an NVA. Configure UDRs in spokes that have an NVA set as the next hop, and enableAllow forwarded trafficin the hub virtual network.
For more information, seeService chaining, and discuss these requirements with theNVA vendorof your choice.

Troubleshoot a hub-spoke network connectivity issue between a web app and the spoke virtual network
To troubleshoot this issue:
Sign in to the Azure portal.
In the web app, selectnetworking, and then selectVNet Integration.
Check whether you can see the remote virtual network. Manually enter the remote virtual network address space (Sync NetworkandAdd Routes).
For more information, see the following articles:

Troubleshoot a virtual network peering configuration error message
Current tenant<TENANT ID>isn't authorized to access linked subscription
<TENANT ID>
To resolve this issue, seeCreate a virtual network peering between different subscriptions.
Not connected
To resolve this issue, delete the peering from both virtual networks, and then recreate them.
Failed to peer a Databricks virtual network
To resolve this issue, configure the virtual network peering underAzure Databricks, and then specify the target virtual network by usingResource ID. For more information, seePeer a Databricks virtual network to a remote virtual network.
The remote virtual network lacks a gateway
This issue occurs when you peer virtual networks from different tenants and later want to configureUse Remote Gateways. A limitation of the Azure portal is that it can't validate the presence of a virtual network gateway in another tenant's virtual network.
Use Remote Gateways
There are two ways to resolve the issue:
Delete the peerings and activate theUse Remote Gatewaysoption when you create a new peering.
Use Remote Gateways
Use PowerShell or CLI, instead of the Azure portal, to enableUse Remote Gateways.
