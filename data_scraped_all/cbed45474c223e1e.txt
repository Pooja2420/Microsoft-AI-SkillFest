This article explains connectivity settings in Azure Synapse Analytics and how to configure them where applicable.
For connection strings to Azure Synapse Analytics pools, seeConnect to Synapse SQL.
The capabilities and Azure portal appearance of configuring a dedicated SQL pool depend on whether it is in a logical SQL server or an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
Dedicated SQL pools in a workspace
Dedicated SQL pools in a logical SQL server
Public network access
Note
These settings apply to dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) in an Azure Synapse analytics workspace. These instructions do not apply dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) associated with the logical SQL server.
You can use the public network access feature to allow incoming public network connectivity to your Azure Synapse workspace.
When public network access isdisabled, you can connect to your workspace only usingprivate endpoints.
When public network access isenabled, you can connect to your workspace also from public networks. You can manage this feature both during and after your workspace creation.
Important
This feature is only available to Azure Synapse workspaces associated withAzure Synapse Analytics Managed Virtual Network. However, you can still open your Synapse workspaces to the public network regardless of its association with managed VNet.
When the public network access is disabled, access to GIT mode in Synapse Studio and commit changes won't be blocked as long as the user has enough permission to access the integrated Git repo or the corresponding Git branch. However, the publish button won't work because the access to Live mode is blocked by the firewall settings.
When the public network access is disabled, the self-hosted integration runtime can still communicate with Synapse. We do not currently support establishing a private link between a self-hosted integration runtime and Synapse control plane.
Selecting theDisableoption will not apply any firewall rules that you might configure. Additionally, your firewall rules will appear grayed out in the Network setting in Synapse portal. Your firewall configurations are reapplied when you enable public network access again.
Tip
When you revert to enable, allow some time before editing the firewall rules.

Minimal TLS version
The serverless SQL endpoint and development endpoint only accept TLS 1.2 and above.
Since December 2021, a minimum level of TLS 1.2 is required for workspace-managed dedicated SQL pools in new Synapse workspaces. You can raise or lower this requirement using theminimal TLS REST APIfor both new Synapse workspaces or existing workspaces, so users who cannot use a higher TLS client version in the workspaces can connect. Customers can also raise the minimum TLS version to meet their security needs.
Important
Azure will begin to retire older TLS versions (TLS 1.0 and 1.1) starting in November 2024. Use TLS 1.2 or higher. After March 31, 2025, you will no longer be able to set the minimal TLS version for Azure Synapse Analytics client connections below TLS 1.2.  After this date, sign-in attempts from connections using a TLS version lower than 1.2 will fail. For more information, seeAnnouncement: Azure support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will end.
Azure Policy
Azure policy to prevent modifications to the networking settings in Synapse Workspace is not currently available.
Networking and connectivity
You can change these settings in yourlogical server. A logical SQL server can host both Azure SQL databases and standalone dedicated SQL pools not in an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
Important
These settings apply to standalone dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) associated with the logical server, not in an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. These instructions do not apply to dedicated SQL pools in an Azure Synapse analytics workspace.
Change public network access
It's possible to change the public network access for your standalone dedicated SQL pool via the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure CLI.
Note
These settings take effect immediately after they're applied. Your customers might experience connection loss if they don't meet the requirements for each setting.
To enable public network access for the logical server hosting your standalone dedicated SQL pool:
Go to the Azure portal, and go to the logical server in Azure.
UnderSecurity, select theNetworkingpage.
Choose thePublic accesstab, and then set thePublic network accesstoSelect networks.
From this page, you can add a virtual network rule, as well as configure firewall rules for your public endpoint.
Choose thePrivate accesstab to configure aprivate endpoint.
It's possible to change public network access by using Azure PowerShell.

It's possible to change the public network settings by using theAzure CLI.
The following CLI script shows how to change thePublic Network Accesssetting in a Bash shell:
# Get current setting for Public Network Access
az sql server show -n sql-server-name -g sql-server-group --query "publicNetworkAccess"

# Update setting for Public Network Access
az sql server update -n sql-server-name -g sql-server-group --set publicNetworkAccess="Disabled"
# Get current setting for Public Network Access
az sql server show -n sql-server-name -g sql-server-group --query "publicNetworkAccess"

# Update setting for Public Network Access
az sql server update -n sql-server-name -g sql-server-group --set publicNetworkAccess="Disabled"
Deny public network access
The default for thePublic network accesssetting isDisable. Customers can choose to connect to a database by using either public endpoints (with IP-based server-level firewall rules or with virtual-network firewall rules), orprivate endpoints(by using Azure Private Link), as outlined in thenetwork access overview.
WhenPublic network accessis set toDisable, only connections from private endpoints are allowed. All connections from public endpoints will be denied with an error message similar to:
Error 47073
An instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. 
The public network interface on this server is not accessible. 
To connect to this server, use the Private Endpoint from inside your virtual network.

Minimum TLS version
The minimumTransport Layer Security (TLS)version setting allows customers to choose which version of TLS is in use. It's possible to change the minimum TLS version by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure CLI.
After you test to confirm that your applications support it, we recommend setting the minimal TLS version to 1.3. This version includes fixes for vulnerabilities in previous versions and is the highest supported version of TLS for standalone dedicated SQL pools.
Upcoming retirement changes
Azure has announced that support for older TLS versions (TLS 1.0, and 1.1) ends August 31, 2025. For more information, seeTLS 1.0 and 1.1 deprecation.
Starting November 2024, you will no longer be able to set the minimal TLS version for Azure Synapse Analytics client connections below TLS 1.2.
Configure minimum TLS version
You can configure the minimum TLS version for client connections by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.
Caution
The default for the minimal TLS version is to allow all versions. After you enforce a version of TLS, it's not possible to revert to the default.
Enforcing a minimum of TLS 1.3 might cause issues for connections from clients that don't support TLS 1.3 since not alldriversand operating systems support TLS 1.3.
For customers with applications that rely on older versions of TLS, we recommend setting the minimal TLS version according to the requirements of your applications. If application requirements are unknown or workloads rely on older drivers that are no longer maintained, we recommend not setting any minimal TLS version.
For more information, seeTLS considerations for database connectivity.
After you set the minimal TLS version, customers who are using a TLS version lower than the minimum TLS version of the server will fail to authenticate, with the following error:
Error 47072
Login failed with invalid TLS version
Error 47072
Login failed with invalid TLS version
Note
The minimum TLS version is enforced at the application layer. Tools that attempt to determine TLS support at the protocol layer might return TLS versions in addition to the minimum required version when run directly against the endpoint.
Go to the Azure portal, and go to the logical server in Azure.
UnderSecurity, select theNetworkingpage.
Choose theConnectivitytab. Select theMinimum TLS Versiondesired for all databases associated with the server, and selectSave.
It's possible to change the minimum TLS version by using Azure PowerShell.

Identify client connections
You can use the Azure portal and SQL audit logs to identify clients that are connecting using TLS 1.0 and 1.0.
In the Azure portal, go toMetricsunderMonitoringfor your database resource, and then filter bySuccessful connections, andTLS versions=1.0and1.1:
1.0
1.1

Connection policy
The connection policy for Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics is set toDefault. You cannot change the connection policy for dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics.
Logins for dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics can land onany of the individual Gateway IP addresses or Gateway IP address subnets in a region. For consistent connectivity, allow network traffic to and fromall the individual Gateway IP addresses and Gateway IP address subnetsin a region. Refer to theAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags - Public Cloudfor a list of your region's IP addresses to allow.
Default:This is the connection policy in effect on all servers after creation unless you explicitly alter the connection policy to eitherProxyorRedirect.  The default policy is:Redirectfor all client connections originating inside of Azure (for example, from an Azure Virtual Machine).Proxyfor all client connections originating outside (for example, connections from your local workstation).
