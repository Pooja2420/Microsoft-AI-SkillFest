Thenpm auditcommand performs a thorough scan of your project, identifying potential security vulnerabilities and generating a detailed report that highlights any issues found. Conducting security audits is a vital step in recognizing and resolving vulnerabilities within the project's dependencies. Thenpm audit fixcommand automatically addresses the detected vulnerabilities, updating insecure package versions to the latest secure releases.
Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for preventing potential problems like data loss, service disruptions, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Warning
Executingnpm auditwill transmit the names of all packages specified in yourpackage.jsonto the public registry.
Run npm audit locally
npm auditcan be executed locally without needing to authenticate with your feed. This allows you to scan your project for vulnerabilities and receive a detailed report on the detected security issues and their severity.
npm audit
If you want to fix the detected vulnerabilities, you can runnpm audit fix, but you must be authenticated with your feed in order to do so. This command updates insecure package versions to the latest secure releases available.
npm audit fix
When you run npm audit fix, it not only updates the local project'spackage.jsonandpackage-lock.jsonbut also syncs these changes with the associated Azure Artifacts feed. The newly secured versions of the packages will be automatically available in your feed.
This synchronization ensures that other projects sharing the same feed will also benefit from these updates. It helps maintain a consistent and secure set of package versions across all projects.
Run the following command in your project directory to perform an npm audit:npm audit

If you want to attempt to upgrade to non-vulnerable package versions, make sure you'reconnected to your feedfirst, then run the following command in your project directory:npm audit fix
If you want to attempt to upgrade to non-vulnerable package versions, make sure you'reconnected to your feedfirst, then run the following command in your project directory:
npm audit fix
npm audit fix
After runningnpm audit fix, make sure to conduct a thorough testing on your application to confirm that the updates didn't introduce any breaking changes. If a fix requires a major version update, it's recommended to review the package's release notes for any potential breaking changes. Keep in mind that while a private package with public vulnerable dependencies receives vulnerability alerts, it won't receive fixes throughnpm audit fix.
Note
npm auditautomatically runs with each execution ofnpm install, but it only works for public packages.
Run npm audit from your pipeline
Azure Pipelines doesn't currently supportnpm audit. If you try using the regularnpm auditcommand in your pipeline, it will fail. Instead, executenpm auditwith the--registryargument and provide your feed's source URL.
