Azure AI Search (formerly known as "Azure Cognitive Search") is an enterprise-ready information retrieval system for your heterogeneous content that you ingest into a search index, and surface to users through queries and apps. It comes with a comprehensive set of advanced search technologies, built for high-performance applications at any scale.
Azure AI Search is the recommended retrieval system for building RAG-based applications on Azure, with native LLM integrations between Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Machine Learning, an integration mechanism for non-native models and processes, and multiple strategies for relevance tuning.
Azure AI Search can be used in both traditional and GenAI search scenarios. Common use cases include catalog or document search, information discovery (data exploration), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for conversational search.
When you create a search service, you work with the following capabilities:
A search engine forvector searchandfull textandhybrid searchover a search index.
Rich indexing with the ability to content transformation. This includesintegrated data chunking and vectorizationfor RAG,lexical analysisfor text, andoptional applied AIfor content extraction and enrichment.
Rich query syntax forvector queries, text search,hybrid queries, fuzzy search, autocomplete, geo-search and others.
Relevance and query performance tuning withsemantic ranking,scoring profiles,quantization for vector queries, and parameters for controlling query behaviors at runtime.
Azure scale, security, and reach.
Azure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI.
Create a search service
Architecturally, a search service sits between the external data stores that contain your un-indexed data, and your client app that sends query requests to a search index and handles the response.

In your client app, the search experience is defined using APIs from Azure AI Search, and can include relevance tuning, semantic ranking, autocomplete, synonym matching, fuzzy matching, pattern matching, filter, and sort.
Across the Azure platform, Azure AI Search can integrate with other Azure services in the form ofindexersthat automate data ingestion/retrieval from Azure data sources, andskillsetsthat incorporate consumable AI from Azure AI services, such as image and natural language processing, or custom AI that you create in Azure Machine Learning or wrap inside Azure Functions.
Inside a search service
On the search service itself, the two primary workloads areindexingandquerying.
Indexingis an intake process that loads content into your search service and makes it searchable. Internally, inbound text is processed into tokens and stored in inverted indexes, and inbound vectors are stored in vector indexes. The document format that Azure AI Search can index is JSON. You can upload JSON documents that you've assembled, or use an indexer to retrieve and serialize your data into JSON.Applied AIthrough askillsetextends indexing with image and language models. If you have images or large unstructured text in source document, you can attach skills that perform OCR, analyze and describe images, infer structure, translate text, and more. Output is text that can be serialized into JSON and ingested into a search index.Skillsets can also performdata chunking and vectorization during indexing. Skills that attach to Azure OpenAI, the model catalog inAzure AI Foundry portal, or custom skills that attach to any external chunking and embedding model can be used during indexing to create vector data. Output is chunked vector content that can be ingested into a search index.

Queryingcan happen once an index is populated with searchable content, when your client app sends query requests to a search service and handles responses. All query execution is over a search index that you control.Semantic rankingis an extension of query execution. It adds secondary ranking, using language understanding to reevaluate a result set, promoting the most semantically relevant results to the top.Integrated vectorizationis also an extension of query execution. If you have vector fields in your search index, you can submit raw vector queries or text that's vectorized at query time.

Why use Azure AI Search?
Azure AI Search is well suited for the following application scenarios:
Use it for traditional full text search and next-generation vector similarity search. Back your generative AI apps with information retrieval that leverages the strengths of both keyword and similarity search. Use both modalities to retrieve the most relevant results.

Consolidate heterogeneous content into a user-defined and populated search index composed of vectors and text. You maintain ownership and control over what's searchable.

Add linguistic or custom text analysis. If you have non-English content, Azure AI Search supports both Lucene analyzers and Microsoft's natural language processors. You can also configure analyzers to achieve specialized processing of raw content, such as filtering out diacritics, or recognizing and preserving patterns in strings.

How to get started
Functionality is exposed through the Azure portal, simpleREST APIs, or Azure SDKs like theAzure SDK for .NET. The Azure portal supports service administration and content management, with tools for prototyping and querying your indexes and skillsets.
Use the Azure portal
An end-to-end exploration of core search features can be accomplished in four steps:
Decide on a tierand region. One free search service is allowed per subscription. All quickstarts can be completed on the free tier. For more capacity and capabilities, you'll need abillable tier.
