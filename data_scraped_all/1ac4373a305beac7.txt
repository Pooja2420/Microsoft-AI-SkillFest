Baseline architecture for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
This article provides a recommended baseline infrastructure architecture to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It uses our design principles and is based on AKSarchitectural best practicesfrom theAzure Well-Architected Framework. This article helps guide multiple distinct interdisciplinary groups, like networking, security, and identity teams, when they deploy this general-purpose infrastructure.
This architecture isn't focused on a workload. It concentrates on the AKS cluster itself. This information is the minimum recommended baseline for most AKS clusters. It integrates with Azure services that deliver observability, provide a network topology that supports multi-regional growth, and secure in-cluster traffic.
Your business requirements influence the target architecture and it can vary between different application contexts. Consider the architecture as your starting point for preproduction and production stages.
Kubernetes is a powerful ecosystem that extends beyond Azure and Microsoft technologies. When you deploy an AKS cluster, you take responsibility for numerous decisions about how your cluster should be designed and operated. Running an AKS cluster involves a mix of closed-source components from a variety of vendors, including Microsoft; and open-source components from the Kubernetes ecosystem. The landscape changes frequently, and you might need to revisit decisions regularly. By adopting Kubernetes, you're acknowledging that your workload needs its capabilities, and that the workload team is prepared to invest on an ongoing basis.
You can use an implementation of this architecture onGitHub: AKS baseline reference implementation. Use it as an alternative starting point and configure the reference architecture based on your needs.
Note
The reference architecture requires knowledge of Kubernetes and its concepts. If you need a refresher, see theIntro to KubernetesandDevelop and deploy applications on Kubernetestraining paths.

Network topology
This architecture uses a hub and spoke network topology. Deploy the hub and spokes in separate virtual networks that are connected throughvirtual network peering. This topology has several advantages. Use this topology to:
Enable segregated management. You can apply governance and adhere to the principle of least privilege. It also supports the concept of anAzure landing zonewith a separation of duties.

Hub virtual network
The hub virtual network is the central point of connectivity and observability. In this architecture, the hub contains:
Azure Firewall with global firewall policies, defined by your central IT teams to enforce organization-wide firewall policy.
Azure Bastion for remote access to virtual machines (VMs).
A gateway subnet for VPN connectivity.
Azure Monitor for network observability.
Within the network, the architecture has three subnets.
Azure Firewallis managed firewall service. The Azure Firewall instance secures outbound network traffic. Without this layer of security, the traffic might communicate with a malicious, non-Microsoft service that could exfiltrate sensitive workload data. UseAzure Firewall Managerto centrally deploy and configure multiple Azure Firewall instances and manage Azure Firewall policies for thishub virtual networkarchitecture type.
This subnet is a placeholder for a VPN gateway or an Azure ExpressRoute gateway. The gateway provides connectivity between the routers in your on-premises network and the virtual network.
This subnet is a placeholder forAzure Bastion. You can use Azure Bastion to securely access Azure resources without exposing the resources to the internet. This subnet is for management and operations only.
Spoke virtual network
The spoke virtual network contains the AKS cluster and other related resources. The spoke has the following subnets.
Application Gatewayis a web traffic load balancer that operates at Layer 7. The reference implementation uses the Application Gateway v2 SKU that enablesAzure Web Application Firewall. Web Application Firewall secures incoming traffic from common web traffic attacks, including bots. The instance has a public front-end IP configuration that receives user requests. By design, Application Gateway requires a dedicated subnet.
To route and distribute traffic,Traefikis the ingress controller that fulfills the Kubernetes ingress resources. The Azure internal load balancers exist in this subnet. For more information, seeUse an internal load balancer with AKS.
AKS maintains two node pools, which are separate groups of nodes. The system node pool hosts pods that run core cluster services. The user node pool runs your workload and the ingress controller to enable inbound communication to the workload.
Create Private Link connections for theAzure Container RegistryandAzure Key Vaultso that users can access these services by way of aprivate endpointwithin the spoke virtual network. Private endpoints don't require a dedicated subnet. You can also place private endpoints in the hub virtual network. In the baseline implementation, the endpoints are deployed to a dedicated subnet within the spoke virtual network. This approach reduces traffic that passes through the peered network connection. It keeps the resources that belong to the cluster in the same virtual network. You can also apply granular security rules at the subnet level by using network security groups.
For more information, seePrivate Link deployment options.
Plan the IP addresses

Download aVisio fileof this architecture.
This reference architecture uses multiple networking approaches, which each requires an IP address space:
Your Azure virtual network, which is used for resources like cluster nodes, private endpoints, and Application Gateway.
The cluster usesAzure CNI Overlay, which allocates IP addresses to pods from a separate address space to your Azure virtual network.
Virtual network IP address space
The address space of your Azure virtual network should be large enough to hold all of your subnets. Account for all entities that receive traffic. Kubernetes allocates IP addresses for those entities from the subnet address space. Consider these points when you plan your Azure virtual network's IP addresses.
Upgrades:AKS updates nodes regularly to make sure the underlying VMs are up to date on security features and other system patches. During an upgrade process, AKS creates a node that temporarily hosts the pods, while the upgrade node is cordoned and drained. That temporary node is assigned an IP address from the cluster subnet. Ensure you have enough address space for these temporary node IP addresses.In this architecture, pods are allocated IP addresses from within the Azure CNI Overlay pod address space, including during rolling updates. This approach reduces the overall number of IP addresses used from your Azure virtual network compared to other Kubernetes networking approaches.

Scalability:Take into consideration the node count of all system and user nodes and their maximum scalability limit. Suppose you want to scale out by 400%. You need four times the number of addresses for all those scaled-out nodes.Because this architecture uses Azure CNI Overlay, the scalability of your pods doesn't affect your virtual network's address space.

The preceding list isn't exhaustive. If your design has other resources that affect the number of available IP addresses, accommodate those addresses.
This architecture is designed for a single workload. In a production AKS cluster, always separate the system node pool from the user node pool. When you run multiple workloads on the cluster, you might want to isolate the user node pools from each other. When you do that, it results in more subnets that are smaller in size. Also, the ingress resource might be more complex, and as a result you might need multiple ingress controllers that require extra IP addresses.
Pod IP address space
Azure CNI Overlay assigns IP addresses to pods by using a dedicated address space, which is separate from the address space you use in your virtual network. Use an IP address space that doesn't overlap with your virtual network or any peered virtual networks. However, if you create multiple AKS clusters, you can safely use the same pod address space on each cluster.
Each node is assigned a /24 address space for its pods, so it's important to ensure that the pod address space is sufficiently large to allow for as many /24 blocks as you need for the number of nodes in your cluster. Remember to include any temporary nodes created during upgrades or scale-out operations. For example, if you use a /16 address space for your CIDR range, your cluster can grow to a maximum of about 250 nodes.
Each node supports up to 250 pods, and this limit includes any pods that are temporarily created during upgrades.

Add-ons and preview features
Kubernetes and AKS continuously evolve, with faster release cycles than software for on-premises environments. This baseline architecture depends on select AKS preview features and AKS add-ons. Here's the difference between the two:
The AKS team describes preview features asshipped and improvingbecause many of the preview features stay in that state for only a few months before moving to the general availability (GA) phase.

This baseline architecture doesn't include every preview feature or add-on. Instead, it includes only the ones that add significant value to a general-purpose cluster. As these features come out of preview, this baseline architecture is revised accordingly. There are some other preview features or AKS add-ons you might want to evaluate in preproduction clusters. These features can improve your security, manageability, or other requirements. With non-Microsoft add-ons, you must install and maintain them, including tracking available versions and installing updates after upgrading a cluster's Kubernetes version.
Container image reference
In addition to the workload, the cluster might contain several other images, such as the ingress controller. Some of those images might reside in public registries. Consider these points when you pull the images into your cluster.
Authenticate the cluster to pull the image.

Import a public image into the container registry that aligns with your service-level objective (SLO), if you're using a public image. Otherwise, the image might be subject to unexpected availability problems. If the image is unavailable when you need it, that can cause operational problems. Here are some benefits of using a private container registry, like Azure Container Registry, instead of a public registry:You can block unauthorized access to your images.You don't have public-facing dependencies.You can access image pull logs to monitor activities and triage connectivity problems.You can take advantage of integrated container scanning and image compliance.

Configure compute for the base cluster
In AKS, each node pool maps to a virtual machine scale set. Nodes are VMs in each node pool. Consider using a smaller VM size for the system node pool to minimize costs. This reference implementation deploys the system node pool with three DS2_v2 nodes. That size is sufficient to meet the expected load of the system pods. The operating system disk is 512 GB.
For the user node pool, here are some considerations:
Choose larger node sizes to pack the maximum number of pods set on a node. Large nodes minimize the footprint of services that run on all nodes, such as monitoring and logging.

Select the appropriate VM type if you have specific workload requirements. For example, you might need a memory-optimized product for some workloads, or a GPU-accelerated product for others. For more information, seeSizes for virtual machines in Azure.

Deploy at least two nodes. That way, the workload has a high availability pattern with two replicas. With AKS, you can change the node count without recreating the cluster.

Plan the actual node sizes for your workload based on the requirements determined by your design team. Based on the business requirements, this architecture uses DS4_v2 for the production workload. To lower costs, you can drop the size to DS3_v2, which is the minimum recommendation.

Assume that your workload consumes up to 80% of each node when planning capacity for your cluster. The remaining 20% is reserved for AKS services.

Set the maximum pods per node based on your capacity planning. If you're trying to establish a capacity baseline, start with a value of 30. Adjust that value based on the requirements of the workload, the node size, and your IP constraints.

Select an operating system
Most AKS clusters use Linux as the operating system for their node pools. In this reference implementation, we useAzure Linux, which is a lightweight, hardened Linux distribution that has been tuned for Azure. You can choose to use another Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, if you prefer, or if you have requirements that Azure Linux can't meet.
If you have a workload that is composed of a mixture of technologies, you can use different operating systems in different node pools. However, if you don't need different operating systems for your workload, we recommend that you use a single operating system for all your workload's node pools.
Integrate Microsoft Entra ID for the cluster
Securing access to and from the cluster is critical. Think of it from the cluster's perspective when you're making security choices:
Inside-out access. Consider AKS access to Azure components such as networking infrastructure, Container Registry, and Key Vault. Authorize only the resources that the cluster should be allowed to access.
Outside-in access. Provide identities access to the Kubernetes cluster. Authorize only those external entities that are allowed access to the Kubernetes API server and Azure Resource Manager.
AKS access to Azure
There are two ways to manage AKS to Azure access through Microsoft Entra ID:service principalsormanaged identitiesfor Azure resources.
Of the two methods to manage AKS access to Azure, we recommend managed identities. With service principals, you must manage and rotate secrets, either manually or programmatically. With managed identities, Microsoft Entra ID manages and performs the authentication and timely rotation of secrets for you.
We recommend that you enable and usemanaged identitiesso that the cluster can interact with external Azure resources through Microsoft Entra ID. Even if you don't use Microsoft Entra ID integration immediately, you can incorporate it later.
By default, there are two primaryidentitiesthat are used by the cluster: thecluster identityand thekubelet identity. The AKS control plane components use thecluster identityto manage cluster resources including ingress load balancers, and AKS managed public IPs. Thekubelet identityauthenticates with Container Registry. Some add-ons also support authentication by using a managed identity.
You should use managed identities when the cluster needs to pull images from a container registry. This action requires the cluster to get the credentials of the registry. If you don't use a managed identity, then you might store that information in the form of a Kubernetes secret object and useimagePullSecretsto retrieve the secret. We don't recommend this approach because of security complexities. Not only do you need prior knowledge of the secret, you also need to store that secret within the DevOps pipeline. Another reason we don't recommend this approach is the operational overhead of managing the rotation of the secret. Instead, grantAcrPullaccess to the kubelet managed identity of the cluster to your registry. This approach addresses the concerns.
imagePullSecrets
AcrPull
In this architecture, the cluster accesses Azure resources that Microsoft Entra ID secures and the cluster performs operations that support managed identities. Assign Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and permissions to the cluster's managed identities, depending on the operations that the cluster does. The cluster authenticates itself to Microsoft Entra ID and then is allowed or denied access based on the roles assigned to it. Here are some examples from this reference implementation where Azure built-in roles are assigned to the cluster:
Network Contributor role. Manages the cluster's ability to control the spoke virtual network. With this role assignment, the AKS cluster system-assigned identity can work with the dedicated subnet for the internal ingress controller service.

Cluster access
Microsoft Entra integration also simplifies security for outside-in access. For example, you might want to use kubectl. As an initial step, you can run theaz aks get-credentialscommand to get the credentials of the cluster. Microsoft Entra ID authenticates your identity against the Azure roles that are allowed to get cluster credentials. For more information, seeAvailable cluster roles permissions.
az aks get-credentials
AKS supports Kubernetes access by using Microsoft Entra ID in two ways. The first is by using Microsoft Entra ID as an identity provider integrated with the native Kubernetes RBAC system. The other method uses native Azure RBAC to control cluster access. The following sections detail both approaches.
Kubernetes supports RBAC through:
A set of permissions that you define by using aRoleorClusterRoleobject for cluster-wide permissions.

RoleBinding
ClusterRoleBinding
Kubernetes has some built-in roles such as cluster-admin, edit, and view. Bind those roles to Microsoft Entra users and groups to use the enterprise directory to manage access. For more information, seeUse Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra integration.
Be sure that you include the Microsoft Entra groups for cluster and namespace access in yourMicrosoft Entra access reviews.
Instead of using Kubernetes native RBAC,ClusterRoleBindingsandRoleBindingsfor authorization with integrated Microsoft Entra authentication, we recommend that you use Azure RBAC and Azure role assignments. This approach enforces authorization checks on the cluster. You can even assign these roles at the management group, subscription, or resource group scopes. All clusters under the scope then inherit a consistent set of role assignments with respect to who has permissions to access the objects on the Kubernetes cluster.
ClusterRoleBindings
RoleBindings
For more information, seeAzure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization.
AKS supports nativeKubernetes user authentication. We don't recommend that you use this method to provide user access to clusters. This method is certificate-based and performed external to your primary identity provider, which makes your centralized user access control and governance difficult. Always manage access to your cluster by using Microsoft Entra ID, and configure your cluster to explicitly disable local account access.
In this reference implementation, local cluster accounts access is explicitly disabled when the system deploys the cluster.

Integrate Microsoft Entra ID for the workload
Similar to having an Azure system-assigned managed identity for the entire cluster, you can assign managed identities at the pod level. A workload identity enables the hosted workload to access resources through Microsoft Entra ID. For example, the workload stores files in Azure Storage. When it needs to access those files, the pod authenticates itself against the resource as an Azure managed identity.
In this reference implementation,Microsoft Entra Workload ID on AKSprovides the managed identities for pods. This approach integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with external identity providers. For more information about Microsoft Entra Workload ID federation, seeWorkload identity federation.
Select a networking model
Important
On31 March 2028, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.
To avoid service disruptions,you'll need toupgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlaybefore that date, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.
AKS supports multiple networking models including kubenet, CNI, andAzure CNI Overlay. The CNI models are the more advanced models, and are highly performant. When communicating between pods, the performance of CNI is similar to the performance of VMs in a virtual network. CNI also offers enhanced security control because it enables the use of Azure network policy. We recommend a CNI-based networking model.
In the non-overlay CNI model, every pod gets an IP address from the subnet address space. Resources within the same network (or peered resources) can access the pods directly through their IP address. Network Address Translation (NAT) isn't needed for routing that traffic.
In this reference implementation, we use Azure CNI Overlay, which only allocates IP addresses from the node pool subnet for the nodes and uses a highly optimized overlay layer for pod IPs. Because Azure CNI Overlay uses fewer virtual network IP addresses than many other approaches, we recommend it for IP address-constrained deployments.
For information about the models, seeChoose a Container Networking Interface network model to useandCompare kubenet and Azure Container Networking Interface network models.
Deploy ingress resources
Kubernetes ingress resources handle routing and distributing for incoming traffic to the cluster. There are two parts of ingress resources:
The internal load balancer, managed by AKS. The load balancer exposes the ingress controller through a private static IP address. It serves as single point of contact that receives inbound flows.This architecture uses Azure Load Balancer. Load Balancer is outside the cluster in a subnet dedicated for ingress resources. It receives traffic from Application Gateway and that communication is over transport layer security (TLS). For more information about TLS encryption for inbound traffic, seeIngress traffic flow.

The ingress controller is a critical component of the cluster. Consider the following points when configuring this component.
Constrain the ingress controller to a specific scope of operations as part of your design decisions. For example, you might allow the controller to only interact with the pods that run a specific workload.

Consider restricting the ingress controller's access to specific resources and the ability to perform certain actions. You can implement that restriction through Kubernetes RBAC permissions. For example, in this architecture, Traefik is granted permissions to watch, get, and list services and endpoints by using rules in the KubernetesClusterRoleobject.

ClusterRole
Note
Choose an appropriate ingress controller based on your requirements, workload, team's skill sets, and the supportability of the technology options. Most importantly, your ingress controller must meet your SLO expectation.
Traefik is an open-source option for a Kubernetes cluster and is in this architecture for illustrative purposes. It shows non-Microsoft product integration with Azure services. For example, the implementation shows how to integrate Traefik with Microsoft Entra Workload ID and Key Vault.
You can also useApplication Gateway Ingress Controller, which integrates well with AKS. Apart from its capabilities as an ingress controller, it offers other benefits. For example, Application Gateway acts as the virtual network entry point of your cluster. It can observe traffic entering the cluster. Use Application Gateway if you have an application that requires a web application firewall. Also, Application Gateway enables you to do TLS termination.
Router settings
The ingress controller uses routes to determine where to send traffic. Routes specify the source port at which the traffic is received and information about the destination ports and protocols.
Here's an example from this architecture:
Traefik uses the Kubernetes provider to configure routes. Theannotations,tls, andentrypointsoptions indicate that routes are served over HTTPS. Themiddlewaresoption specifies that only traffic from the Application Gateway subnet is allowed. The responses use gzip encoding if the client accepts. Because Traefik does TLS termination, communication with the back-end services is over HTTP.

The architecture only accepts TLS encrypted requests from the client. TLS v1.2 is the minimum allowed version with a restricted set of ciphers. Server Name Indication (SNI) strict matching is enabled. End-to-end TLS is set up through Application Gateway by using two different TLS certificates, as shown in the following diagram.

Application Gateway has an integrated web application firewall and negotiates the TLS handshake forbicycle.contoso.com, allowing only secure ciphers. Application Gateway is a TLS termination point, which is important because Application Gateway's web application firewall needs to inspect the plaintext response. Key Vault stores the TLS certificate. The cluster accesses it with a user-assigned managed identity that is integrated with Application Gateway. For more information, seeTLS termination with Key Vault certificates.Application Gateway processes web application firewall inspection rules and runs routing rules that forward the traffic to the configured back end.

Application Gateway processes web application firewall inspection rules and runs routing rules that forward the traffic to the configured back end.
As traffic moves from Application Gateway to the back end, it's encrypted again with another TLS certificate, which is a wildcard for*.aks-ingress.contoso.com, as it's forwarded to the internal load balancer. This re-encryption helps ensure that unsecured traffic doesn't flow into the cluster subnet.

You can implement end-to-end TLS traffic at every hop through the workload pod. Be sure to measure the performance, latency, and operational effects when making the decision to secure pod-to-pod traffic. For most single-tenant clusters, with proper control plane RBAC and mature software development lifecycle practices, it's sufficient to TLS encrypt up to the ingress controller and protect with Web Application Firewall. This approach minimizes overhead in workload management and overhead because of poor network performance. Your workload and compliance requirements dictate where you performTLS termination.
Egress traffic flow
In this architecture, we recommend that all egress traffic from the cluster communicates through Azure Firewall. Or you can use your own similar network virtual appliance. We don't recommend using other egress options, such asAzure NAT Gatewayor anHTTP proxybecause they don't provide network traffic inspection. For Zero Trust control and the ability to inspect traffic, all egress traffic from the cluster moves through Firewall. You can implement this configuration with user-defined routes (UDRs). The next hop of the route is theprivate IP addressof Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall decides whether to block or allow the egress traffic. That decision is based on the specific rules you define in Azure Firewall or the built-in threat intelligence rules.
An alternative to Azure Firewall is to use the AKSHTTP proxyfeature. All traffic that leaves the cluster goes to the IP address of the HTTP proxy, which forwards the traffic or drops it.
For either method, review the requiredegress network traffic rulesfor AKS.
Note
If you use a public load balancer as your public point for ingress traffic and egress traffic through Firewall using UDRs, you might see anasymmetric routing situation. This architecture uses internal load balancers in a dedicated ingress subnet behind Application Gateway. This design choice not only enhances security but also eliminates asymmetric routing concerns. Or you can route ingress traffic through Firewall before or after Application Gateway, but this approach isn't necessary for most situations, and we don't recommend it. For more information about asymmetric routing, seeIntegrate Firewall with an Azure standard load balancer.
An exception to the Zero Trust control is when the cluster needs to communicate with other Azure resources. For example, the cluster might need to pull an updated image from the container registry or secrets from Key Vault. In these scenarios, we recommend that you usePrivate Link. The advantage is that specific subnets reach the service directly, and the traffic between the cluster and the services doesn't go over the internet. A downside is that Private Link needs extra configuration instead of using the target service over its public endpoint. Also, not all Azure services or products support Private Link. For those cases, consider enabling avirtual network service endpointon the subnet to access the service.
If Private Link or service endpoints aren't an option, you can reach other services through their public endpoints and control access through Azure Firewall rules and the firewall built into the target service. Because this traffic goes through the static IP addresses of the firewall, you can add those addresses to the service's IP allowlist. One downside is that Azure Firewall then needs more rules to make sure it allows only traffic from a specific subnet. Factor in those addresses when you're planning multiple IP addresses for egress traffic with Azure Firewall. Otherwise, you could reach port exhaustion. For more information about planning for multiple IP addresses, seeCreate an Azure Firewall with multiple IP addresses.
Pod-to-pod traffic
By default, a pod can accept traffic from any other pod in the cluster. Use KubernetesNetworkPolicyto restrict network traffic between pods. Apply policies judiciously, or you might have a situation where a critical network flow is blocked.Onlyallow specific communication paths, as needed, such as traffic between the ingress controller and workload. For more information, seeNetwork policies.
NetworkPolicy
Enable network policy when you provision the cluster because you can't add it later. You have a few choices for technologies that implementNetworkPolicy. We recommend Azure network policy, which requires Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI). For more information, see the following note. Other options include Calico network policy, a well-known open-source option. Consider Calico if you need to manage cluster-wide network policies. Calico isn't covered under standard Azure support.
NetworkPolicy
For more information, seeDifferences between Azure network policy engines.
Management traffic
As part of running the cluster, the Kubernetes API server receives traffic from resources that want to do management operations on the cluster, such as requests to create resources to scale the cluster. Examples of those resources include the build agent pool in a DevOps pipeline, an Azure Bastion instance within the Azure Bastion subnet, and the node pools themselves. Instead of accepting this management traffic from all IP addresses, use the AKS-authorized IP ranges feature to only allow traffic from your authorized IP ranges to the API server
For more information, seeDefine API server-authorized IP ranges.
For another layer of control, at the cost of extra complexity, you can provision a private AKS cluster. By using a private cluster, you can help ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains on the private network only and is never exposed to the internet. For more information, seeAKS private clusters.
Add secret management
Store secrets in a managed key store, such as Key Vault. The advantage is that a managed key store handles the rotation of secrets. It provides strong encryption and an access audit log. It also keeps core secrets out of the deployment pipeline. In this architecture, a Key Vault firewall is enabled and configured, and Private Link is used when connecting from resources in Azure that need to access secrets and certificates.
Key Vault is well integrated with other Azure services. Use the built-in feature of those services to access secrets. For more information about how Application Gateway accesses TLS certificates for the ingress flow, see theIngress traffic flowsection.
The Azure RBAC permission model for Key Vault enables you to assign the workload identities to either the Key Vault Secrets User or Key Vault Reader role assignment, and access the secrets. For more information, seeAccess Key Vault by using RBAC.
Access cluster secrets
You need to use workload identities to allow a pod to access secrets from a specific store. To facilitate the retrieval process, use asecrets store CSI driver. When the pod needs a secret, the driver connects with the specified store, retrieves a secret on a volume, and mounts that volume in the cluster. The pod can then get the secret from the volume file system.
The CSI driver has many providers to support various managed stores. This implementation uses theKey Vault with secrets store CSI driver. The add-on retrieves the TLS certificate from Key Vault and loads the driver in the pod that runs the ingress controller. This operation occurs during pod creation, and the volume stores both public and the private keys.
Workload storage
The workload in this architecture is stateless. If you need to store state, we recommend persisting it outside the cluster. Guidance for workload state is outside the scope of this article.
For more information, seeStorage options for applications in AKS.
Policy management
An effective way to manage an AKS cluster is to enforce governance through policies. Kubernetes implements policies through Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper. For AKS, deliver policies through Azure Policy. Each policy applies to all clusters in its scope. OPA Gatekeeper handles policy enforcement in the cluster and it logs all policy checks. The policy changes aren't immediately reflected in your cluster, so expect some delays.
To manage your AKS clusters, you can use Azure Policy to:
Prevent or restrict the deployment of AKS clusters in a resource group or subscription. Apply standards for your organization. For example, you can follow a naming convention or specify a tag.
Secure your AKS cluster through Azure Policy for Kubernetes.
When setting policies, apply them based on the requirements of the workload. Consider these factors:
Do you want to set a collection of policies, also called initiatives, or choose individual policies? Azure Policy provides two built-in initiatives: basic and restricted. Each initiative is a collection of built-in policies applicable to an AKS cluster. We recommend that you select an initiativeandchoose other policies for the cluster and the resources, such as Container Registry, Application Gateway, or Key Vault, that interact with the cluster. Choose policies based on the requirements of your organization.

Do you want toAuditorDenythe action? InAuditmode, the action is allowed but flagged asNon-Compliant. Have processes to check noncompliant states at a regular cadence and take necessary action. InDenymode, the action is blocked because it violates the policy. Be careful when choosing this mode, because it can be too restrictive for the workload to function.

InDenymode, the action is blocked because it violates the policy. Be careful when choosing this mode, because it can be too restrictive for the workload to function.
Do you have areas in your workload that shouldn't be compliant by design? Azure Policy has the capability to specify Kubernetes namespaces that are exempt from policy enforcement. We recommend that you still apply policies inAuditmode so that you're aware of those instances.

Do you have requirements that aren't covered by the built-in policies? You can create a custom Azure Policy definition that applies your custom OPA Gatekeeper policies. Don't apply custom policies directly to the cluster. For more information, seeCreate and assign custom policy definitions.

Do you have organization-wide requirements? If so, add those policies at the management group level. Your cluster should also assign its own workload-specific policies, even if your organization has generic policies.

Do you assign Azure policies to specific scopes? Ensure theproductionpolicies are also validated against yourpreproductionenvironment. Otherwise, when deploying to your production environment, you might run into unexpected extra restrictions that you don't account for in preproduction.

This reference implementation enables Azure Policy when the AKS cluster is created. The restrictive initiative is assigned inAuditmode to gain visibility into noncompliance.
The implementation also sets extra policies that aren't part of any built-in initiatives. Those policies are set inDenymode. For example, there's a policy in place to make sure images are only pulled from the deployed Container Registry instance. Consider creating your own custom initiatives. Combine the policies that are applicable for your workload into a single assignment.
To observe how Azure Policy functions from within your cluster, you can access the pod logs for all pods in thegatekeeper-systemnamespace and the logs for theazure-policyandazure-policy-webhookpods in thekube-systemnamespace.

Node and pod scalability
With increasing demand, Kubernetes can scale out by adding more pods to existing nodes, through horizontal pod autoscaling. When Kubernetes can no longer schedule more pods, the number of nodes must be increased through AKS cluster autoscaling. A complete scaling solution must have ways to scale both pod replicas and the node count in the cluster.
There are two approaches: autoscaling or manual scaling.
Both the autoscaling and manual approach require you to monitor and set alerts on CPU usage or custom metrics. For pod scaling, your application operator can increase or decrease the number of pod replicas by adjusting theReplicaSetthrough Kubernetes APIs. For cluster scaling, one method is to be notified when the Kubernetes scheduler fails. Another way is to watch for pending pods over time. You can adjust the node count through Azure CLI or the Azure portal.
ReplicaSet
We recommend the autoscaling approach because some of those manual mechanisms are built into the autoscaler.
As a general method, start by performance testing with a minimum number of pods and nodes. Use those values to establish the baseline expectation. Then, use a combination of performance metrics and manual scaling to locate bottlenecks and understand the application's response to scaling. Finally, use this data to set the parameters for autoscaling.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
TheHorizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)is a Kubernetes resource that scales the number of pods.
In the HPA resource, we recommend setting the minimum and maximum replica count. The values constrain the autoscaling bounds.
The HPA can scale based on CPU usage, memory usage, and custom metrics. Only CPU usage is provided out of the box. TheHorizontalPodAutoscalerdefinition specifies target values for the metrics. For instance, the spec sets the target CPU usage. While pods are running, the HPA controller uses the Kubernetes Metrics API to check each pod's CPU usage. It compares that value against the target usage and calculates a ratio. It then uses the ratio to determine whether pods are overallocated or underallocated. It relies on the Kubernetes scheduler to assign new pods to nodes or remove pods from nodes.
HorizontalPodAutoscaler
There might be a race condition where the HPA checks before a scaling operation finishes. The outcome might be an incorrect ratio calculation. For more information, seeCooldown of scaling events.
If your workload is event-driven, a popular open-source option isKubernetes event-driven autoscaling (KEDA). Consider KEDA if an event source, such as message queue, drives your workload, rather than your workload being CPU-bound or memory-bound. KEDA supports many event sources or scalers. Use the list of event sources that KEDA can scale atKEDA scalers. The list includes theAzure Monitor scaler, which is a convenient way to scale KEDA workloads based on Azure Monitor metrics.
Cluster autoscaler
Thecluster autoscaleris an AKS add-on component that scales the number of nodes in a node pool. Add it during cluster provisioning. You need a separate cluster autoscaler for each user node pool.
The Kubernetes scheduler triggers the cluster autoscaler. When the Kubernetes scheduler fails to schedule a pod because of resource constraints, the autoscaler automatically provisions a new node in the node pool. Conversely, the cluster autoscaler checks the unused capacity of the nodes. If the node isn't running at an expected capacity, the pods are moved to another node, and the unused node is removed.
When you enable the autoscaler, set the maximum and minimum node count. The recommended values depend on the performance expectation of the workload, how much you want the cluster to grow, and cost implications. The minimum number is the reserved capacity for that node pool. In this reference implementation, the minimum value is set to two because of the simplicity of the workload.
For the system node pool, the recommended minimum value is three.
Business continuity decisions
To maintain business continuity, define the SLO for the infrastructure and your application. For more information, seeRecommendations for defining reliability targets. Review the service level agreement (SLA) conditions for AKS in the latestSLA for online servicesarticle.
Cluster nodes
To meet the minimum level of availability for workloads, you need multiple nodes in a node pool. If a node fails, another node in the same node pool and cluster can continue running the application. For reliability, we recommend three nodes for the system node pool. For the user node pool, start with no fewer than two nodes. If you need higher availability, provision more nodes.
Isolate your application from the system services by placing it in a separate node pool, referred to as auser node pool. This way, Kubernetes services run on dedicated nodes and don't compete with your workload. We recommend that you use tags, labels, and taints to identify the node pool and schedule your workload. Ensure that your system node pool is tainted with theCriticalAddonsOnlytaint.
CriticalAddonsOnly
Regular upkeep on your cluster, such as timely updates, are crucial for reliability. Also, we recommend that you monitor the health of the pods through probes.
Pod availability
Specify pod resource requirements: We recommended that you specify pod resource requirements in your deployments. The scheduler can then appropriately schedule the pod. Reliability is greatly reduced if your pods can't be scheduled.
Set pod disruption budgets: This setting determines how many replicas in a deployment can come down during an update or upgrade event. For more information, seePod disruption budgets.
Configure multiple replicas in the deployment to handle disruptions such as hardware failures. For planned events such as updates and upgrades, a disruption budget can help ensure the required number of pod replicas exist to handle expected application load.
Set resource quotas on the workload namespaces: The resource quota on a namespace helps ensure pod requests and limits are properly set on a deployment. For more information, seeEnforce resource quotas.
Note
If you set resources quotas at the cluster level, problems can occur if you deploy third-party workloads that don't have proper requests and limits.
Set pod requests and limits: Setting requests and limits enables Kubernetes to efficiently allocate CPU and memory resources to the pods, and lets you have higher container density on a node. Requests and limits can also increase your reliability while reducing your costs because of better hardware usage.
To estimate the limits for a workload, test and establish a baseline. Start with equal values for requests and limits. Then, gradually tune those values until you establish a threshold that can cause instability in the cluster.
You can specify requests and limits in your deployment manifests. For more information, seeSet pod requests and limits.
Availability zones and multi-region support
To protect against some types of outages, useavailability zonesif the region supports them. Both the control plane components and the nodes in the node pools are then able to spread across zones. If an entire zone is unavailable, a node in another zone within the region is still available. Each node pool maps to a separate virtual machine scale set, which manages node instances and scalability. The AKS service manages scale set operations and configuration. Here are some considerations when you enable multiple zones:
Entire infrastructure: Choose a region that supports availability zones. For more information, seeLimitations. To have an uptime SLA, you need to choose the Standard or Premium tier. The uptime SLA is greater when using availability zones.
Entire infrastructure: Choose a region that supports availability zones. For more information, seeLimitations. To have an uptime SLA, you need to choose the Standard or Premium tier. The uptime SLA is greater when using availability zones.
Cluster: You can only set availability zones when you create the node pool. They can't be changed later. The node sizes should be supported in all zones so that the expected distribution is possible. The underlying virtual machine scale set provides the same hardware configuration across zones.Multiple zone support not only applies to node pools, but the control plane as well. The AKS control plane spans the zones requested, like the node pools. If you don't use zone support in your cluster, the control plane components aren't guaranteed to spread across availability zones.

Multiple zone support not only applies to node pools, but the control plane as well. The AKS control plane spans the zones requested, like the node pools. If you don't use zone support in your cluster, the control plane components aren't guaranteed to spread across availability zones.
Dependent resources: For complete zonal benefit, all service dependencies must also support zones. If a dependent service doesn't support zones, it's possible that a zone failure can cause that service to fail.For example, a managed disk is available in the zone where it was provisioned. If a failure happens, the node might move to another zone, but the managed disk doesn't move with the node to that zone.

For example, a managed disk is available in the zone where it was provisioned. If a failure happens, the node might move to another zone, but the managed disk doesn't move with the node to that zone.
For simplicity in this architecture, AKS is deployed to a single region with node pools that span availability zones one, two, and three. Other resources of the infrastructure, such as Azure Firewall and Application Gateway, are also deployed to the same region with multiple zone support. Geo-replication is enabled for Container Registry.
Multiple regions
When you enable availability zones, it isn't enough coverage in the unlikely event that an entire region fails. To gain higher availability, run multiple AKS clusters in different regions.
Preferpaired regionswhen they're available. A benefit of using paired regions is reliability during platform updates. Azure makes sure that only one region in the pair is updated at a time.Some regions don't have pairs. If your region isn't paired, you can still deploy a multi-region solution by selecting other regions to use. Consider using a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, which you configure to orchestrate recovery from a region failure. Certain DevOps tools such as Flux can make the multi-region deployments easier.

Provide the location where the redundant service has its secondary instance if an Azure resource supports geo-redundancy. For example, by enabling geo-replication for Container Registry, it automatically replicates images to the selected Azure regions. It also provides continued access to images even if the primary region experiences an outage.

Choose a traffic router that can distribute traffic across zones or regions, depending on your requirement. This architecture deploys Load Balancer because it can distribute nonweb traffic across zones. If you need to distribute traffic across regions, consider Azure Front Door.

Disaster recovery
If a failure happens in the primary region, ideally, you can quickly create a new instance in another region. Here are some recommendations:
Use multiple regions. If your primary region has a paired region, use that pair. If not, select regions based on your data residency and latency requirements.

Use a nonstateful workload that you can replicate efficiently. If you need to store state in the cluster, which we don't recommend, be sure you back up the data frequently in another region.

Provision each Azure service by using features that support disaster recovery. For example, in this architecture, Container Registry is enabled for geo-replication. If a region fails, you can still pull images from the replicated region.

Deploy your infrastructure as code, including your AKS cluster and any other components you need. If you need to deploy into another region, you can reuse the scripts or templates to create an identical instance.
Deploy your infrastructure as code, including your AKS cluster and any other components you need. If you need to deploy into another region, you can reuse the scripts or templates to create an identical instance.
For many architectures, you can provision a new cluster and return it to operating state through Git operations-basedcluster bootstrapping, followed by application deployment. But if there's critical resource state, such as config maps, jobs, and secrets that can't be captured within your bootstrapping process, consider your recovery strategy. We recommend that you run stateless workloads in Kubernetes. If your architecture involves disk-based state, you must also consider your recovery strategy for that content.
When cluster backup must be a part of your recovery strategy, you need to install a solution that matches your business requirements within the cluster. This agent is responsible for pushing cluster resource state out to a destination of your choosing and coordinating Azure disk-based, persistent volume snapshots.
VMwareVelerois an example of a common Kubernetes backup solution that you can install and manage directly. Or you can use theAKS backup extensionto provide a managed Velero implementation. The AKS backup extension supports backing up both Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes, with schedules and backup scope externalized as vault configuration in Azure Backup.
The reference implementation doesn't implement backup, which involves extra Azure resources to manage, monitor, purchase, and secure. These resources might include an Azure Storage account, an Azure Backup vault and configuration, and thetrusted access feature. Instead, Git operations combined with the intent to run stateless workload is the recovery solution.
Choose and validate a backup solution that meets your business objective, including your defined recovery-point objective and recovery-time objective. Define your recovery process in a team runbook and practice it for all business-critical workloads.
Kubernetes API server SLA
You can use AKS as a free service, but that tier doesn't offer a financially backed SLA. To obtain an SLA, you must choose theStandard tier. We recommend all production clusters use the Standard tier. Reserve the Free tier for preproduction clusters and the Premium tier formission-critical workloadsonly. When you use Azure availability zones, the Kubernetes API server SLA is higher. Your node pools and other resources are covered under their own SLAs. For more information about specific SLAs for each service, seeSLA for online services.
Tradeoff
There's a cost-to-availability tradeoff for deploying the architecture across zones and especially regions. Some replication features, such as geo-replication in Container Registry, are available in premium SKUs, which is more expensive. For multi-region deployments, the cost also increases because bandwidth charges apply when traffic moves across regions.
Also, expect extra network latency in node communication between zones or regions. Measure the effect of this architectural decision on your workload.
Test with simulations and forced failovers
Test your solution's reliability through forced failover testing with simulated outages. Simulations can include stopping a node, bringing down all AKS resources in a particular zone to simulate a zonal failure, or invoking an external dependency failure. You can also use Azure Chaos Studio to simulate various types of outages in Azure and on the cluster.
For more information, seeChaos Studio.

Monitor and collect logs and metrics
We recommend Azure Monitorcontainer insightsto monitor the performance of container workloads because you can view events in real time. It captures container logs from the running pods and aggregates them for viewing. It also collects information from the metrics API about memory and CPU usage to monitor the health of running resources and workloads. You can also use container insights to monitor performance as the pods scale. It includes telemetry that's critical for monitoring, analysis, and visualization of the collected data.
Enable log collection from pods
TheContainerLogV2 log schemais designed to capture container logs from Kubernetes pods in a streamlined approach. Log entries are consolidated into theContainerLogV2table in an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
ContainerLogV2
In an AKS cluster, there are two primary methods for configuring pod log collection with Container Insights. Both approaches allow you to customize settings such as filtering namespaces, adjusting collection intervals, enabling or disabling specific features (for example, ContainerLogV2 or ContainerLogV2-HighScale), and specifying which data streams to collect.
If you require centralized, reusable monitoring configurations across multiple clusters or prefer cluster configuration to be externalized in Azure-native resources, usedata collection rules(DCRs). DCRs are native Azure resources managed via the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) control plane, and they can be included in Bicep files.
Alternatively, you can define monitoring by using ConfigMaps, which are nonconfidential Kubernetes YAML objects configured through the Kubernetes API control plane. The Container Insights agent running on the cluster monitors for ConfigMap objects, and it uses predefined settings to determine which data to collect.
When both methods are enabled, ConfigMap settings take precedence over DCRs. Avoid mixing ConfigMap and DCR configuration for container log collection, because this can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot logging issues.
Alerts and Prometheus metrics
Outages and malfunctions pose significant risks to workload applications, making it essential to proactively identify issues related to your infrastructure's health and performance. Monitoring, and acting on the information you see, can minimize disruptions and increase the reliability of your solution. To anticipate potential failure conditions in your cluster, enablethe recommended Prometheus alert rules for Kubernetes.
Most workloads hosted in pods emit Prometheus metrics. Container insights can integrate with Prometheus. You can view the application and workload metrics collected from containers, pods, nodes, and the cluster.
Some non-Microsoft solutions integrate with Kubernetes, such as Datadog, Grafana, or New Relic. So if your organization already uses these solutions, you can take advantage of them.
Azure infrastructure and Kubernetes control plane logs
With AKS, Azure manages some of the core Kubernetes services. Azure implements the logs for the AKS control plane components asresource logs. We recommend that you enable the following options on most clusters. The options can help you troubleshoot cluster problems, and they have a relatively low log density.

It might be helpful for you to enable other log categories, such asKubeSchedulerorkube-audit, during early cluster or workload lifecycle development. The added cluster autoscaling, pod placement and scheduling, and similar data can help you troubleshoot cluster or workload operations concerns. But if you keep the extended troubleshooting logs on full time after your troubleshooting needs end, you might be incurring unnecessary costs to ingest and store the data in Azure Monitor.

While Azure Monitor includes a set of existing log queries to start with, you can also use them as a foundation to help build your own queries. As your library grows, you can save and reuse log queries by using one or morequery packs. Your custom library of queries provides more observability into the health and performance of your AKS clusters. It supports achieving your SLOs.
For more information about our monitoring best practices for AKS, seeMonitor AKS with Azure Monitor.
Network metrics
Basic, cluster-level networking metrics are available through nativeplatform and Prometheus metrics. You can further use AKSnetwork observabilityto expose network metrics at the node level by using Prometheus metrics. Most clusters should include network observability to provide extra network troubleshooting capabilities, and to detect unexpected network usage or problems at the node level.
The reference implementation uses Azure Monitor container insights, which also collects some network-related metrics. The reference implementation disables collection of metrics from Azure Monitor container insights, and instead collects the network observability metrics by using an Azure Monitor workspace withmanaged Prometheus.
For workloads that are highly sensitive to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet loss, latency, or DNS pressure, the pod-level network metrics are important. In AKS, you can find that level of detail with theadvanced network observabilityfeature. Most workloads don't require this depth of network observability. You shouldn't enable advanced network observability unless your pods demand a highly optimized network, with sensitivity down to the packet level.
Cost optimization for logging
The reference implementation configures theContainerLogV2table to use the Basic plan as a starting point. Microsoft Defender for Containers and the alerts created for the reference implementation don't query this table, so the Basic plan is likely to be cost effective because it reduces ingestion costs.
ContainerLogV2
As your log volume and query requirements evolve, select the most cost-effective table plan for your needs. If the solution becomes read-intensive, where queries frequently scan table data, the default Analytics plan might be more suitable. The Analytics plan eliminates query charges, which optimizes for scenarios where query activity outweighs ingestion costs. By monitoring usage patterns and adjusting table plans as needed, you can achieve a balance between cost and functionality for your monitoring solution.
For more information, seeSelect a table plan based on data usage in a Log Analytics workspace.
Enable self-healing
Monitor the health of pods by settingliveness and readiness probes. If Kubernetes detects an unresponsive pod, it restarts the pod. A liveness probe determines if the pod is healthy. If Kubernetes detects an unresponsive pod, it restarts the pod. A readiness probe determines if the pod is ready to receive requests and traffic.
Note
AKS has anautomatic node repair featurethat provides built-in self-healing for infrastructure nodes.
Routine updates for AKS clusters
Part of day-2 operations for Kubernetes clusters is to perform routine platform and operating system updates. There are three layers of updates to address on every AKS cluster:
The Kubernetes version (for example, Kubernetes 1.30.3 to 1.30.7 or Kubernetes 1.30.7 to 1.31.1), which might come with Kubernetes API changes and deprecations. Version changes at this layer affect the whole cluster.
The virtual hard disk (VHD) image on each node, which combines operating system updates and AKS component updates. These updates are tested against the cluster's Kubernetes version. Version changes at this layer are applied at the node pool level and don't affect the Kubernetes version.
The operating system's own native update process, such as Windows Update orapt. The operating system vendor supplies these updates directly and they aren't tested against the cluster's Kubernetes version. Version changes at this layer affect a single node and don't affect the Kubernetes version.
apt
Each of these layers is independently controlled. You decide how each layer is handled for your workload's clusters. Choose how often each AKS cluster, its node pools, or its nodes are updated (thecadence). Also, pick what days or times to apply the updates (yourmaintenance window). Choose whether updates install manually or automatically or not at all. Just like the workload that runs on your cluster needs a safe deployment practice, so do the updates to your clusters.
For a comprehensive perspective about patching and upgrading, seeAKS patch and upgrade guidancein theAKS day-2 operations guide. Use the following information for baseline recommendations as it relates to this architecture.
Workloads that operate AKS clusters as immutable infrastructure don't automatically or manually update their clusters. Set thenode image upgradetononeand thecluster automatic upgradetonone. In this configuration, you're solely responsible for all upgrades at all layers. When an update that you want becomes available, you must test the update in a preproduction environment and evaluate its compatibility on a new cluster. After that, deploy a production replica stamp that includes the updated AKS version and node pool VHDs. When the new production cluster is ready, the old cluster is drained and eventually gets decommissioned.

Immutable infrastructure with regular deployments of new infrastructure is the only situation in which a production cluster shouldn't have an in-place upgrade strategy applied to it. All other clusters should have an in-place upgrade strategy.
Workloads that don't operate AKS clusters as immutable infrastructure, should regularly update their running clusters, to address all three layers. Align your update process to your workload's requirements. Use the following recommendations as a starting point for designing your routine update process.
Schedule theplanned maintenancefeature of AKS so you can control upgrades on your cluster. This feature enables you to perform the updates, an inherently risky operation, at a controlled time to reduce the effect of an unexpected failure.
Configurepod disruption budgetssuch that your application remains stable during rolling upgrades.  But don't configure the budgets to be so aggressive that they block node upgrades from happening, because most upgrades require a cordon and drain process on each node.
Confirm Azure resource quota and resource availability. In-place upgrades deploy new instances of nodes, known assurge nodes, before old nodes are removed. This means Azure quota and IP address space must be available for the new nodes. Asurge valueof 33% is a good starting point for most workloads.
Test compatibility with tooling, such as service meshes or security agents that you added to your cluster. And test your workload components, such as ingress controllers, service meshes, and your workload pods. Do tests in a preproduction environment.
Use theNodeImageautomatic upgrade channel for node OS image upgrades. This channel configures your cluster to update the VHD on each node with node-level updates. Microsoft tests the updates against your AKS version. For Windows nodes, the updates happen about once per month. For Linux nodes, these updates happen about once per week.
NodeImage
The upgrades never change your AKS or Kubernetes version, so Kubernetes API compatibility isn't a concern.
When you useNodeImageas the upgrade channel, it respects your planned maintenance window, which you should set for at least once per week. Set it no matter what node image operating system you use to help ensure timely application.
NodeImage
These updates include operating system-level security, compatibility, and functional updates, operating system configuration settings, and AKS component updates.
Image releases and their included component version numbers are tracked by using theAKS release tracker.
If the security requirements for your cluster demand a more aggressive patching cadence and your cluster can tolerate the potential interruptions, use theSecurityPatchupgrade channel instead. Microsoft also tests these updates. The updates only publish if there are security upgrades that Microsoft considers important enough to release before the next scheduled node image upgrade. When you use theSecurityPatchchannel, you also get the updates that theNodeImagechannel received. TheSecurityPatchchannel option still honors your maintenance windows, so be sure your maintenance window has more frequent gaps (such as daily or every other day) to support these unexpected security updates.

Kubernetes is a rapidly evolving platform, and regular updates bring important security fixes and new capabilities. It's important that you remain current with Kubernetes updates. You should stay within thetwo most recent versions or N-2. It's critical to upgrade to the latest version of Kubernetes because new versions are released frequently.
Most clusters should be able to perform in-place AKS version updates with enough caution and rigor. The risk of performing an in-place AKS version upgrade can mostly be mitigated through sufficient preproduction testing, quota validation, and pod disruption budget configuration. But any in-place upgrade can result in unexpected behavior. If in-place upgrades are deemed too risky for your workload, we recommended you use ablue-green deployment of AKS clustersapproach instead of following the remaining recommendations.
We recommend that you avoid thecluster automatic upgradefeature when you first deploy a Kubernetes cluster. Use a manual approach, which provides you with the time to test a new AKS cluster version in your preproduction environments before the updates hit your production environment. This approach also achieves the greatest level of predictability and control. But you must be diligent about monitoring for new updates to the Kubernetes platform, and quickly adopting new versions as they release. It's better to adopt a 'stay current' mindset over along-term supportapproach.
Warning
We don't recommend automatically patching or updating a production AKS cluster, even with minor version updates, unless you test those updates in your lower environments first. For more information, seeRegularly update to the latest version of KubernetesandUpgrade an AKS cluster.
You can receive notifications when a new AKS version is available for your cluster by using theAKS system topic for Azure Event Grid. The reference implementation deploys this Event Grid system topic so that you can subscribe to theMicrosoft.ContainerService.NewKubernetesVersionAvailableevent from your event stream notification solution. Review theAKS release notesfor specific compatibility concerns, behavior changes, or feature deprecations.
Microsoft.ContainerService.NewKubernetesVersionAvailable
You might eventually reach the point of confidence with Kubernetes releases, AKS releases, your cluster, its cluster-level components, and the workload, to explore the automatic upgrade feature. For production systems, it would be rare to ever move beyondpatch. Also, when automatically upgrading your AKS version, also check your infrastructure as code's (IaC) AKS version setting for your cluster so that they don't get out of sync. Configure yourplanned maintenancewindow to support the automatic upgrade operation.

Security monitoring
Monitor your container infrastructure for both active threats and potential security risks. Here are some resources:
Microsoft Defender for Containerstoidentify and remediate Defender for Cloud recommendationsfor your container images.
Defender for Containers regularlyscans your container images for vulnerabilities.
Defender for Containers also generatesreal-time security alerts for suspicious activities.
AKSSecurity concepts for applications and clustersdetails information about how container security protects the entire end-to-end pipeline from build to the application workloads running in AKS.
Cluster and workload operations
For cluster and workload operations (DevOps) considerations, see theOperational Excellence design principlespillar.
Cluster bootstrapping
After you do provisioning, you have a working cluster, but you might still have some required steps before you can deploy workloads. The process of preparing your cluster is called bootstrapping. Bootstrapping can consist of deploying prerequisite images onto cluster nodes, creating namespaces, and doing other tasks that fulfill the requirements of your organization's use case.
To decrease the gap between a provisioned cluster and a properly configured one, cluster operators should think about what their unique bootstrapping process looks like. They need to prepare the relevant assets in advance. For example, if having Kured running on each node before deploying application workloads is important, the cluster operator should verify that a Container Registry instance that contains the target Kured image, already existsbeforethey provision the cluster.
You can configure the bootstrapping process by using one of the following methods:
GitOps Flux v2 cluster extension
Pipelines
Self-configuration with Flux or Argo CD, for example
Note
Any of these methods work with any cluster topology, but we recommend the GitOps Flux v2 cluster extension for fleets because of uniformity and easier governance at scale. When you run only a few clusters, GitOps might be overly complex. You might instead opt to integrate the process into one or more deployment pipelines to ensure that bootstrapping takes place. Use the method that best aligns with your organization and team objectives.
One of the main advantages of using the GitOps Flux v2 cluster extension for AKS is that there's effectively no gap between a provisioned cluster and a bootstrapped cluster. It sets up the environment with a solid management foundation going forward, and it also supports including that bootstrapping as resource templates to align with your IaC strategy.
Finally, when using the extension, kubectl isn't required for any part of the bootstrapping process. You can reserve kubectl-based access for emergency break-fix situations. Between templates for Azure resource definitions and the bootstrapping of manifests via the GitOps extension, you can perform all normal configuration activities without the need to use kubectl.
Isolate workload responsibilities
Divide the workload by teams and types of resources to individually manage each portion.
Start with a basic workload that contains the fundamental components and build on it. An initial task is to configure networking. Provision virtual networks for the hub and spokes and also subnets within those networks. For example, a spoke has separate subnets for system and user node pools and ingress resources. Deploy a subnet for Azure Firewall in the hub.
Another task is to integrate the basic workload with Microsoft Entra ID.
Use IaC
Choose an idempotent declarative method over an imperative approach, where possible. Instead of writing a sequence of commands that specify configuration options, use declarative syntax that describes the resources and their properties. You can useBicep,Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), or Terraform.
Be sure to provision resources per the governing policies. For example, when you select VM sizes, stay within the cost constraints and availability zone options to match the requirements of your application. You can also use Azure Policy to enforce your organization's policies for these decisions.
If you need to write a sequence of commands, useAzure CLI. These commands cover a range of Azure services and you can automate them through scripting. Windows and Linux support Azure CLI. Another cross-platform option is Azure PowerShell. Your choice depends on your preferred skill set.
Store and version your scripts and template files in your source control system.
Workload CI/CD
Pipelines for workflow and deployment must be able to build and deploy applications continuously. Updates must deploy safely and quickly and roll back in case there are problems.
Your deployment strategy needs to include a reliable and an automated continuous delivery pipeline. Deploy changes in your workload container images to the cluster automatically.
In this architecture,GitHub Actionsmanages the workflow and deployment. Other popular options includeAzure DevOpsandJenkins.
Cluster CI/CD

Download aVisio fileof this architecture.
Instead of using an imperative approach like kubectl, use tools that automatically synchronize cluster and repository changes. To manage the workflow, such as the release of a new version and validation on that version before deploying to production, consider a GitOps flow.
An essential part of the CI/CD flow is bootstrapping a newly provisioned cluster. A GitOps approach is useful because it lets operators declaratively define the bootstrapping process as part of the IaC strategy and see the configuration reflected in the cluster automatically.
When you use GitOps, an agent is deployed in the cluster to make sure that the state of the cluster is coordinated with configuration stored in your private Git repo. One such agent isflux, which uses one or more operators in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes. Flux does these tasks:
Monitors all configured repositories.
Detects new configuration changes.
Triggers deployments.
Updates the desired running configuration based on those changes.
You can also set policies that govern how the changes are deployed.
Here's an example that shows how to automate cluster configuration with GitOps and Flux:

Download aVisio fileof this architecture.
A developer commits changes to source code, such as configuration YAML files, which are stored in a Git repository. The changes are then pushed to a Git server.

You can have branch policies on your Git server so that multiple developers can then approve changes through a pull request before the change is applied to production.
While you can configure GitOps and Flux manually, we recommend theGitOps with Flux v2 cluster extensionfor AKS.
Workload and cluster deployment strategies
Deployanychange, such as architecture components, workload, and cluster configuration to at least one preproduction AKS cluster. Doing so simulates the change and might identify problems before they're deployed to production.
Run tests and validations at each stage before moving on to the next. It helps ensure that you can push updates to the production environment in a highly controlled way and minimize disruption from unanticipated deployment problems. The deployment should follow a similar pattern as production, by using the same GitHub Actions pipeline or Flux operators.
Advanced deployment techniques, such asblue-green deployment, A/B testing, andcanary releases, require extra processes and potentially extra tooling.Flaggeris a popular open-source solution to help solve for advanced deployment scenarios.
Cost management
Start by reviewing the cost optimization design checklist and list of recommendations outlined inWell-Architected Framework for AKS. Use theAzure pricing calculatorto estimate costs for the services you use in the architecture. For other best practices, seeCost Optimization.
Consider usingAKS cost analysisfor granular cluster infrastructure cost allocation by Kubernetes-specific constructs.
Provision
Understand where your costs come from. There are minimal costs associated with AKS in deployment, management, and operations of the Kubernetes cluster itself. What affects the cost are the VM instances, storage, log data, and networking resources consumed by the cluster. Consider choosing cheaper VMs for system node pools. TheDS2_v2series is a typical VM type for the system node pool.

Don't have the same configuration for dev/test and production environments. Production workloads have extra requirements for high availability and are typically more expensive. This configuration isn't necessary in the dev/test environment.

Use tags when you create node pools. Tags help when you create custom reports to track incurred costs. You can use tags to track the total expenses and map any cost to a specific resource or team. Also, if the cluster is shared between teams, build chargeback reports per consumer to identify metered costs for shared cloud services. For more information, seeSpecify a taint, label, or tag for a node pool.

Monitor
You can monitor the entire cluster and the cost of compute, storage, bandwidth, logs, and the firewall. Azure provides options to monitor and analyze costs:
Azure Advisor
Azure Advisor
Microsoft Cost Management
Microsoft Cost Management
Ideally, monitor your costs in real time or at least at a regular cadence. You can then take action before the end of the month when costs are already calculated. Also, monitor the monthly trends over time to stay in budget.
To make data-driven decisions, pinpoint which resource, at a granular level incurs the most cost. Also, have a good understanding of the meters that calculate resource usage. For example, by analyzing metrics, you can determine whether the platform is oversized. You can see the usage meters in Azure Monitor metrics.
Optimize
Act on recommendations provided byAzure Advisor. There are other ways to optimize:
Enable the cluster autoscaler to detect and remove underused nodes in the node pool.ImportantAggressively changing cluster autoscaler settings, such as minimum and maximum node settings for a node pool, to affect costs might have counterproductive results. For example, ifscale-down-unneeded-timeis set to 10 minutes, and the minimum and maximum node settings are modified every five minutes based on workload characteristics, the number of nodes will never reduce. This is because the calculation of the unneeded time for each node resets due to the cluster autoscaler settings being refreshed.
