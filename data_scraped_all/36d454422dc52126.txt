Your users will probably install or run your app
on a wide variety of configurations, such as different
operating systems, web browsers, and other variations.
You will want to run at least some of your tests in
stages that have those different configurations.
Use your test plans to decide which tests you want to run
on which configurations. You have to make sure that when
you run your tests that you have set up your stages
for the configurations that you need.
You might draw a schematic matrix of the combinations that you want to test:

Then you can:
View available configurations and variables
Create configurations and variables
Assign the configurations to test plans and test suites
Run tests with each of the configurations
Track your test results for each configuration

View configurations and variables
You often want to see the configurations that are already available to run your tests.
Browser
TCM CLI
You can view a list of test configurations and configuration variables from theConfigurationspage.
While in your project, selectTest Plans>Configurationsfrom the left navigation area. Here you'll see all of the test configurations and variables currently available for your test plans.

Select a configuration or variable to see more information about it in the window to the right.
Usetcm configs /listto view the configurations available for the test plans and test suites in your project. When no optional parameters are specified, all test configurations are listed for the team project.

Create configurations and variables
A test configuration is a combination of configuration variable values.
Your configuration variables could be, for example, operating system, browser, CPU type, database.
A configuration might be "Windows 8 + 32-bit CPU" or "Windows 10 + 64-bit CPU."
Create the configuration variables first.
Then combine multiple variable values to create a configuration.
Open theConfigurationspage in theTest Plansweb portal, select the+icon, and selectNew configuration variable.
Open theConfigurationspage in theTest Plansweb portal, select the+icon, and selectNew configuration variable.

Type a name for the variable, such asBrowser, and a description.
SelectAdd new value, and then add a value.
Add as many values as you wish to the configuration variable, and then save it.
Type a name for the variable, such asBrowser, and a description.
SelectAdd new value, and then add a value.
Add as many values as you wish to the configuration variable, and then save it.

Repeat the steps to create any other configuration variables you need.
For example, create a configuration variable namedOperating systemwith the names of each operating system on which you want to test.

Save your new test configuration.
Save your new test configuration.

Assign configurations to test plans and suites
You can assign configurations to a test suite or an individual test case.
Configurations assigned to a test suite apply to all tests or suites within it.
To assign a configuration to a test suite, in theTest planspage, select a plan.
In theTest Suitesarea, select a test suite and selectMore optionsor right-click to open the context menu and then selectAssign configuration.If you add multiple configurations to a test suite, the tests cases are repeated with each of the configurations you have assigned.
To assign a configuration to a test suite, in theTest planspage, select a plan.
In theTest Suitesarea, select a test suite and selectMore optionsor right-click to open the context menu and then selectAssign configuration.

If you add multiple configurations to a test suite, the tests cases are repeated with each of the configurations you have assigned.

If necessary, override the default configuration assigned to a test case and assign the configuration you need.
Select one or more test cases, open the context menu, and selectAssign configuration.
If necessary, override the default configuration assigned to a test case and assign the configuration you need.
Select one or more test cases, open the context menu, and selectAssign configuration.

Search for and select the configurations to assign to the test cases.

Run tests with each configuration
Set up a testing platform for a particular configuration, such as testing the app using Google Chrome on Windows 10.
Select and run a test that has this configuration assigned.As you run the test, a reminder of the configuration appears in the status bar.
Select and run a test that has this configuration assigned.

Track test results for each configuration
Open theChartspage for your test suite, selectNew, and selectNew test result chart.
Open theChartspage for your test suite, selectNew, and selectNew test result chart.

Choose a type of chart, like a pie chart or bar chart, and then selectGroup by>Configurationand chooseOK.A chart is created that can help you track your tests based on configurations.
You can pin this chart to your dashboard.

You can pin this chart to your dashboard.

If you have a test case that appears in several test suites, you can set the different configurations for each suite.
The same test case can have different configuration settings in different test suites and test plans.
