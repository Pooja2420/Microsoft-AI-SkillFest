TheNetwork Featuresfunctionality enables you to indicate whether you want to use VNet features for an Azure NetApp Files volume. With this functionality, you can set the option toStandardorBasic. You can specify the setting when you create a new NFS, SMB, or dual-protocol volume. You can also modify the network features option on existing volumes. SeeGuidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planningfor details about network features.
Options for network features
Two settings are available for network features:
StandardThis setting enables VNet features for the volume. Standard network features is the default and preferred setting.If you need higher IP limits or VNet features such asnetwork security groups (NSGs),user-defined routes, or additional connectivity patterns, setNetwork FeaturestoStandard.

Considerations
Regardless of the network features option you set (StandardorBasic), an Azure VNet can only have one subnet delegated to Azure NetApp files. SeeDelegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files.

The ability to locate storage compatible with the desired type of network features depends on the VNet specified. If you can't create a volume because of insufficient resources, you can try a different VNet for which compatible storage is available.

When you change the network features option of existing volumes from Basic to Standard network features, access to existing Basic networking volumes might be lost if your UDR or NSG implementations prevent the Basic networking volumes from connecting to DNS and domain controllers. You might also lose the ability to update information, such as the site name, in the Active Directory connector if all volumes canât communicate with DNS and domain controllers. For guidance about UDRs and NSGs, seeConfigure network features for an Azure NetApp Files volume.

Note
The networking features of the DP volume are not affected by changing the source volume from Basic to Standard network features.
Set network features option during volume creation
This section shows you how to set the network features option when you create a new volume.
During the process of creating a newNFS,SMB, ordual-protocolvolume, you can set theNetwork Featuresoption toBasicorStandardunder the Basic tab of the Create a Volume screen.

Edit network features option for existing volumes
You can edit the network features option of existing volumes fromBasictoStandardnetwork features. The change you make applies to all volumes in the samenetwork sibling set(orsiblings). Siblings are determined by their network IP address relationship. They share the same network interface card (NIC) for mounting the volume to the client or connecting to the remote share of the volume. At the creation of a volume, its siblings are determined by a placement algorithm that aims for reusing the IP address where possible.
Important
It's not recommended that you use the edit network features option with Terraform-managed volumes due to risks. You must follow separate instructions if you use Terraform-managed volumes. For more information see,Update Terraform-managed Azure NetApp Files volume from Basic to Standard.
Considerations when editing networking features
If you enabled both theANFStdToBasicNetworkFeaturesRevertandANFBasicToStdNetworkFeaturesUpgradeAFECs and are using 1 or 2-TiB capacity pools, seeResize a capacity pool or a volumefor information about sizing your capacity pools.
ANFStdToBasicNetworkFeaturesRevert
ANFBasicToStdNetworkFeaturesUpgrade
Azure NetApp Files supports a non-disruptive upgrade to Standard network features and a revert to Basic network features. This operation is expected to take at least 15 minutes. You can't create a regular or data protection volume or application volume group in the targeted network sibling set while the operation completes.
Note
You need to submit a waitlist request for accessing the feature through theAzure NetApp Files standard networking features (edit volumes) Request Form. The feature can take approximately one week to be enabled after you submit the waitlist request. You can check the status of feature registration by using the following command:
Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFBasicToStdNetworkFeaturesUpgrade

You can also revert the option fromStandardback toBasicnetwork features. Before performing the revert operation, you must submit a waitlist request through theAzure NetApp Files standard networking features (edit volumes) Request Form. The revert capability can take approximately one week to be enabled after you submit the waitlist request. You can check the status of the registration by using the following command:

If you revert, considerations apply and require careful planning. SeeGuidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planningfor constraints and supported network topologies about Standard and Basic network features.
Edit network features
Navigate to the volume for which you want to change the network features option.
SelectChange network features.
TheEdit network featureswindow displays the volumes that are in the same network sibling set. Confirm whether you want to modify the network features option.
Update Terraform-managed Azure NetApp Files volume from Basic to Standard
If your Azure NetApp Files volume is managed using Terraform, editing the network features requires additional steps. Terraform-managed Azure resources store their state in a local file, which is in your Terraform module or in Terraform Cloud.
Updating the network features of your volume alters the underlying network sibling set of the NIC utilized by that volume. This NIC can be utilized by other volumes you own, and other NICs can share the same network sibling set.If not performed correctly, updating the network features of one Terraform-managed volume can inadvertently update the network features of several other volumes.
Important
A discontinuity between state data and remote Azure resource configurations--notably, in thenetwork_featuresargument--can result in the destruction of one or more volumes and possible data loss upon runningterraform apply. Carefully follow the workaround outlined here to safely update the network features from Basic to Standard of Terraform-managed volumes.
network_features
terraform apply
Note
A Terraform module usually consists solely of all top level*.tfand/or*.tf.jsonconfiguration files in a directory, but a Terraform module can make use of module calls to explicitly include other modules into the configuration. You canlearn more about possible module structures. To update all configuration file in your module that reference Azure NetApp Files volumes, be sure to look at all possible sources where your module can reference configuration files.
*.tf
*.tf.json
The name of the state file in your Terraform module isterraform.tfstate. It contains the arguments and their values of all deployed resources in the module. Below is highlighted thenetwork_featuresargument with value âBasicâ for an Azure NetApp Files Volume in aterraform.tfstateexample file:
terraform.tfstate
network_features
terraform.tfstate

Donotmanually update theterraform.tfstatefile. Likewise, thenetwork_featuresargument in the*.tfand*.tf.jsonconfiguration files should also not be updated until you follow the steps outlined here as this would cause a mismatch in the arguments of the remote volume and the local configuration file representing that remote volume. When Terraform detects a mismatch between the arguments of remote resources and local configuration files representing those remote resources, Terraform can destroy the remote resources and reprovision them with the arguments in the local configuration files. This can cause data loss in a volume.
terraform.tfstate
network_features
*.tf
*.tf.json
By following the steps outlined here, thenetwork_featuresargument in theterraform.tfstatefile is automatically updated by Terraform to have the value of "Standard" without destroying the remote volume, thus indicating the network features has been successfully updated to Standard.

It's recommended to always use the latest Terraform version and the latest version of theazurermTerraform module.

Changing the network features for an Azure NetApp Files Volume can impact the network features of other Azure NetApp Files Volumes. Volumes in the same network sibling set must have the same network features setting. Therefore, before you change the network features of one volume, you must determine all volumes affected by the change using the Azure portal.
Log in to the Azure portal.
Navigate to the volume for which you want to change the network features option.
Select theChange network features.Donotselect Save.
Record the paths of the affected volumes then selectCancel.

All Terraform configuration files that define these volumes need to be updated, meaning you need to find the Terraform configuration files that define these volumes. The configuration files representing the affected volumes might not be in the same Terraform module.
Important
With the exception of the single volume you know is managed by Terraform, additional affected volumes might not be managed by Terraform. An additional volume that is listed as being in the same network sibling set does not mean that this additional volume is managed by Terraform.
You must modify the configuration files for each affected volume managed by Terraform that you discovered. Failing to update the configuration file can destroy the volume or result in data loss.
Important
Depending on your volumeâs lifecycle configuration block settings in your Terraform configuration file, your volume can be destroyed, including possible data loss upon runningterraform apply. Ensure you know which affected volumes are managed by Terraform and which are not.
terraform apply
Locate the affected Terraform-managed volumes configuration files.

Add theignore_changes = [network_features]to the volume'slifecycleconfiguration block. If thelifecycleblock does not exist in that volumeâs configuration, add it.

Theignore_changesfeature is intended to be used when a resourceâs reference to data might change after the resource is created. Adding theignore_changesfeature to thelifecycleblock allows the network features of the volumes to be changed in the Azure portal without Terraform trying to fix this argument of the volume on the next run ofterraform apply. You canlearn more about theignore_changesfeature.
