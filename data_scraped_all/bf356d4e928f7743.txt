The Azure Monitor activity log is a platform log that provides insight into subscription-level events. The activity log includes information like when a resource is modified or a virtual machine is started. This article provides information on how to view the activity log and send it to different destinations.
View the activity log
You can access the activity log from most menus in the Azure portal. The menu that you open it from determines its initial filter. If you open it from theMonitormenu, the only filter is on the subscription. If you open it from a resource's menu, the filter is set to that resource. You can always change the filter to view all other entries. SelectAdd Filterto add more properties to the filter.

For a description of activity log categories, seeAzure activity log event schema.
Download the activity log
SelectDownload as CSVto download the events in the current view.

View change history
For some events, you can view the change history, which shows what changes happened during that event time. Select an event from the activity log you want to look at more deeply. Select theChange historytab to view any changes on the resource up to 30 minutes before and after the time of the operation.

If any changes are associated with the event, you'll see a list of changes that you can select. Selecting a change opens theChange historypage. This page displays the changes to the resource. In the following example, you can see that the VM changed sizes. The page displays the VM size before the change and after the change. To learn more about change history, seeGet resource changes.

Retention period
Activity log events are retained in Azure for90 daysand then deleted. There's no charge for entries during this time regardless of volume. For more functionality, such as longer retention, create a diagnostic setting and route the entries to another location based on your needs. See the criteria in the preceding section.
Activity log insights
Activity log insights provide you with a set of dashboards that monitor the changes to resources and resource groups in a subscription. The dashboards also present data about which users or services performed activities in the subscription and the activities' status. This article explains how to onboard and view activity log insights in the Azure portal.
Activity log insights are a curatedLog Analytics workbookwith dashboards that visualize the data in theAzureActivitytable. For example, data might include which administrators deleted, updated, or created resources and whether the activities failed or succeeded.
AzureActivity
Azure Monitor stores all activity logs you send to aLog Analytics workspacein a table calledAzureActivity. Before you use activity log insights, you mustenable sending logs to your Log Analytics workspace.
