This article provides a quick tour of these capabilities, and it offers ways to use them for a standard load balancer.
Multi-dimensional metrics
Azure Load Balancer provides multi-dimensional metrics via the Azure Metrics in the Azure portal, and it helps you get real-time diagnostic insights into your load balancer resources. Please note that multi-dimensional metrics are not supported for Basic Load Balancers
The various load balancer configurations provide the following metrics:
Note
Bandwidth-related metrics such as SYN packet, byte count, and packet count will not capture any traffic to an internal load balancer via a UDR (eg. from an NVA or firewall).
Max and min aggregations are not available for the SYN count, packet count, SNAT connection count, and byte count metrics.
Count aggregation is not recommended for Data path availability and health probe status. Use average instead for best represented health data.
View your load balancer metrics in the Azure portal
The Azure portal exposes the load balancer metrics via the Metrics page. This page is available on both the load balancer's resource page for a particular resource and the Azure Monitor page.
Note
Azure Load Balancer does not send health probes to deallocated virtual machines. When virtual machines are deallocated, the load balancer will stop reporting metrics for that instance. Metrics that are unavailable will appear as a dashed line in Portal, or display an error message indicating that metrics cannot be retrieved.
To view the metrics for your load balancer resources:
Go to the metrics page and do either of the following tasks:On the load balancer's resource page, select the metric type in the drop-down list.On the Azure Monitor page, select the load balancer resource.

Note
Time aggregation is important when interpreting certain metrics as data is sampled once per minute. If time aggregation is set to five minutes and metric aggregation type Sum is used for metrics such as SNAT allocation, your graph will display five times the total allocated SNAT ports.
Recommendation: When analyzing metric aggregation type Sum and Count, we recommend using a time aggregation value that is greater than one minute.
Retrieve multi-dimensional metrics programmatically via APIs
For API guidance for retrieving multi-dimensional metric definitions and values, seeAzure Monitoring REST API walkthrough. These metrics can be written to a storage account by adding adiagnostic settingfor the 'All Metrics' category.
Common diagnostic scenarios and recommended views
The Data Path Availability metric describes the health within the region of the data path to the compute host where your VMs are located. The metric is a reflection of the health of your load balancer, based on your configuration and the Azure infrastructure. You can use the metric to:
Monitor the external availability of your service.

Additionally, add a filter on the frontend IP address or frontend port as the dimension with the required frontend IP address or frontend port. Then group them by the selected dimension.
The metric is generated by a probing service within the region that simulates traffic. The probing service periodically generates a packet that matches your deployment's frontend and load balancing rule. The packet then traverse the region from the source to the host of a VM in the backend pool. The load balancer infrastructure performs the same load balancing and translation operations as it does for all other traffic. After the probe arrives on the host, where a VM in the backend pool is located, the host generates a response to the probing service. Your VM doesnât see this traffic.
Please note that the Data Path Availability metric will only be generated on frontend IP configurations with load balancing rules.
The Data Path Availability metric can be degraded for the following reasons:
Your deployment has no healthy VMs remaining in the backend pool.
Your deployment has no healthy VMs remaining in the backend pool.
An infrastructure outage has occurred.
An infrastructure outage has occurred.
For diagnostic purposes, you can use theMetric for data path availability together with the health probe status.
UseAverageas the aggregation for most scenarios.
The Health Probe Status metric describes the health of your application deployment as configured by you when you configure the health probe of your load balancer. The load balancer uses the status of the health probe to determine where to send new flows. Health probes originate from an Azure infrastructure address and are visible within the guest OS of the VM.
To get the Health Probe Status metric for your load balancer resources:
Select theHealth Probe Statusmetric withAvgaggregation type.

Health probes fail for the following reasons:
You configure a health probe to a port that isnât listening or not responding or is using the wrong protocol. If your service is using direct server return or floating IP rules, verify the service is listening on the IP address of the NIC's IP configuration and the loopback that's configured with the frontend IP address.

UseAverageas the aggregation for most scenarios.
The SNAT connections metric describes the volume of successful and failed connections foroutbound flows.
A failed connections volume of greater than zero indicates SNAT port exhaustion. You must investigate further to determine what may be causing these failures. SNAT port exhaustion manifests as a failure to establish anoutbound flow. Review the article about outbound connections to understand the scenarios and mechanisms at work, and to learn how to mitigate and design to avoid SNAT port exhaustion.
To get SNAT connection statistics:
SelectSNAT Connectionsmetric type andSumas aggregation.

The used SNAT ports metric tracks how many SNAT ports are being consumed to maintain outbound flows. This metric indicates how many unique flows are established between an internet source and a backend VM or virtual machine scale set that is behind a load balancer and doesnât have a public IP address. By comparing the number of SNAT ports youâre using with the Allocated SNAT Ports metric, you can determine if your service is experiencing or at risk of SNAT exhaustion and resulting outbound flow failure.
If your metrics indicate risk ofoutbound flowfailure, reference the article and take steps to mitigate this to ensure service health.

By using a combination of the data path availability and health probe status metrics on a single chart, you can identify where to look for the problem and resolve the problem. You can gain assurance that Azure is working correctly and use this knowledge to conclusively determine that the configuration or application is the root cause.
You can use health probe metrics to understand how Azure views the health of your deployment as per the configuration youâve provided. Looking at health probes is always a great first step in monitoring or determining a cause.
You can take it a step further and use data path availability metric to gain insight into how Azure views the health of the underlying data plane that's responsible for your specific deployment. When you combine both metrics, you can isolate where the fault might be, as illustrated in this example:

Figure: Combining data path availability and health probe status metrics
The chart displays the following information:
The infrastructure hosting your VMs was unavailable and at 0 percent at the beginning of the chart. Later, the infrastructure was healthy and the VMs were reachable, and more than one VM was placed in the back end. This information is indicated by the blue trace for data path availability, which was later at 100 percent.

The health probe status, indicated by the purple trace, is at 0 percent at the beginning of the chart. The circled area in green highlights where the health probe status became healthy, and at which point the customer's deployment was able to accept new flows.

The chart allows customers to troubleshoot the deployment on their own without having to guess or ask support whether other issues are occurring. The service was unavailable because health probes were
failing due to either a misconfiguration or a failed application.
Configure alerts for multi-dimensional metrics
Azure Load Balancer supports easily configurable alerts for multi-dimensional metrics. Configure custom thresholds for specific metrics to trigger alerts with varying levels of severity to empower a no touch resource monitoring experience.
To configure alerts:
Go to the alert page for the load balancer
Go to the alert page for the load balancer
Create new alert ruleConfigure alert condition (Note: to avoid noisy alerts, we recommend configuring alerts with the Aggregation type set to Average, looking back on a five-minute window of data, and with a threshold of 95%)(Optional) Add action group for automated repairAssign alert severity, name, and description that enables intuitive reaction

Inbound availability alerting
Note
If your load balancer's backend pools are empty, the load balancer will not have any valid data paths to test. As a result, the data path availability metric will not be available, and any configured Azure Alerts on the data path availability metric will not trigger.
To alert for inbound availability,  you can create two separate alerts using the data path availability and health probe status metrics. Customers may have different scenarios that require specific alerting logic, but the below examples are helpful for most configurations.
Using data path availability, you can fire alerts whenever a specific load-balancing rule becomes unavailable. You can configure this alert by setting an alert condition for the data path availability and splitting by all current values and future values for both frontend port and frontend IP address. Setting the alert logic to be less than or equal to 0 will cause this alert to be fired whenever any load-balancing rule becomes unresponsive. Set the aggregation granularity and frequency of evaluation according to your desired evaluation.
With health probe status, you can alert when a given backend instance fails to respond to the health probe for a significant amount of time. Set up your alert condition to use the health probe status metric and split by backend IP address and backend port, using theAverageaggregation type. This ensures that you can alert separately for each individual backend instanceâs ability to serve traffic on a specific port.
Outbound availability alerting
For outbound availability, you can configure two separate alerts using the SNAT connection count and used SNAT port metrics.
To detect outbound connection failures, configure an alert using SNAT connection count and filtering toConnection State = Failed. Use theTotalaggregation. Then, you can split this by backend IP address set to all current and future values to alert separately for each backend instance experiencing failed connections. Set the threshold to be greater than zero or a higher number if you expect to see some outbound connection failures.
With used SNAT ports, you can alert on a higher risk of SNAT exhaustion and outbound connection failure. Ensure youâre splitting by backend IP address and protocol when using this alert. Use theAverageaggregation. Set the threshold to be greater than a percentage of the number of ports youâve allocated per instance that you determine is unsafe. For example, configure a low severity alert when a backend instance uses 75% of its allocated ports. Configure a high severity alert when it uses 90% or 100% of its allocated ports.
Resource health status
Health status for the standard load balancer resources is exposed via the existingResource healthunderMonitor > Service health. Itâs evaluated everytwo minutesby measuring data path availability that determines whether your frontend load-balancing endpoints are available.
To view the health of your public standard load balancer resources:
SelectMonitor>Service health.

A generic description of a resource health status is available in theresource health documentation.
Resource health alerts
Azure Resource Health alerts can notify you in near real-time when the health state of your Load balancer resource changes. It's recommended that you set resource health alerts to notify you when your Load balancer resource is in aDegradedorUnavailablestate.
When you create Azure resource health alerts for Load balancer, Azure sends resource health notifications to your Azure subscription. You can create and customize alerts based on:
The subscription affected
The resource group affected
The resource type affected (Load balancer)
The specific resource (any Load balancer resource you choose to set up an alert for)
The event status of the Load balancer resource affected
The current status of the Load balancer resource affected
The previous status of the Load balancer resource affected
The reason type of the Load balancer resource affected
You can also configure who the alert should be sent to:
A new action group (that can be used for future alerts)
An existing action group
For more information on how to set up these resource health alerts, see:
Resource health alerts using Azure portal
Resource health alerts using Resource Manager templates
