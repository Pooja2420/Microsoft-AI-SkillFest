Azure AI Search support for network security perimeter is in public preview undersupplemental terms of use. It's available inregions providing the feature.
This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
Review thelimitations and considerationssection before you start.
This article explains how to join an Azure AI Search service to anetwork security perimeterto control network access to your search service. By joining a network security perimeter, you can:
Log all access to your search service in context with other Azure resources in the same perimeter.
Block any data exfiltration from a search service to other services outside the perimeter.
Allow access to your search service using inbound and outbound access capabilities of the network security perimeter.
You can add a search service to a network security perimeter in the Azure portal, as described in this article. Alternatively, you can use theAzure Virtual Network Manager REST APIto join a search service, and use theSearch Management REST APIsto view and synchronize the configuration settings.
Limitations and considerations
For search services within a network security perimeter, indexers must use asystem or user-assigned managed identityand have a role assignment that permits read-access to data sources.

Currently, within the perimeter, indexer connections to Azure PaaS for data retrieval is the primary use case. For outbound skills-driven API calls to Azure AI services, Azure OpenAI, or the Azure AI Foundry model catalog, or for inbound calls from the Azure AI Foundry for "chat with your data" scenarios you mustconfigure inbound and outbound rulesto allow the requests through the perimeter. If you require private connections forstructure-aware chunkingand vectorization, you shouldcreate a shared private linkand a private network.

Assign a search service to a network security perimeter
Azure Network Security Perimeter allows administrators to define a logical network isolation boundary for PaaS resources (for example, Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database) that are deployed outside virtual networks. It restricts communication to resources within the perimeter, and it allows non-perimeter public traffic through inbound and outbound access rules.
You can add Azure AI Search to a network security perimeter so that all indexing and query requests occur within the security boundary.

Network security perimeter access modes
Network security perimeter supports two different access modes for associated resources:
ThepublicNetworkAccesssetting determines search service association with a network security perimeter.

In Learning mode, thepublicNetworkAccesssetting controls public access to the resource.

In Enforced mode, thepublicNetworkAccesssetting is overridden by the network security perimeter rules. For example, if a search service with apublicNetworkAccesssetting ofenabledis associated with a network security perimeter in Enforced mode, access to the search service is still controlled by network security perimeter access rules.

Reading network access logs
Thenetwork-security-perimeterAccessLogstable contains all the logs for every log category (for examplenetwork-security-perimeterPublicInboundResourceRulesAllowed). Every log contains a record of the network security perimeter network access that matches the log category.
network-security-perimeterAccessLogs
network-security-perimeterPublicInboundResourceRulesAllowed
Here's an example of thenetwork-security-perimeterPublicInboundResourceRulesAllowedlog format:
network-security-perimeterPublicInboundResourceRulesAllowed
search-service-resource-id
{ "accessRule": "IP firewall" }
The storage account has containers for every log category (for exampleinsights-logs-network-security-perimeterpublicinboundperimeterrulesallowed). The folder structure inside the container matches the resource ID of the network security perimeter and the time the logs were taken. Each line on the JSON log file contains a record of the network security perimeter network access that matches the log category.
insights-logs-network-security-perimeterpublicinboundperimeterrulesallowed
For example, the inbound perimeter rules allowed category log uses the following format:
"properties": {
    "ServiceResourceId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/network-security-perimeter/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/network-security-perimeter-search",
    "Profile": "defaultProfile",
    "MatchedRule": {
        "AccessRule": "myaccessrule"
    },
    "Source": {
        "IpAddress": "255.255.255.255",
    }
}
"properties": {
    "ServiceResourceId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/network-security-perimeter/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/network-security-perimeter-search",
    "Profile": "defaultProfile",
    "MatchedRule": {
        "AccessRule": "myaccessrule"
    },
    "Source": {
        "IpAddress": "255.255.255.255",
    }
}
Add an access rule for your search service
A network security perimeter profile specifies rules that allow or deny access through the perimeter.
Within the perimeter, all resources have mutual access at the network level. You must still set up authentication and authorization, but at the network level, connection requests from inside the perimeter are accepted.
For resources outside of the network security perimeter, you must specify inbound and outbound access rules. Inbound rules specify which connections to allow in, and outbound rules specify which requests are allowed out.
A search service accepts inbound requests from apps likeAzure AI Foundry portal, Azure Machine Learning prompt flow, and any app that sends indexing or query requests. A search service sends outbound requests during indexer-based indexing and skillset execution. This section explains how to set up inbound and outbound access rules for Azure AI Search scenarios.
Note
Any service associated with a network security perimeter implicitly allows inbound and outbound access to any other service associated with the same network security perimeter when that access is authenticated usingmanaged identities and role assignments. Access rules only need to be created when allowing access outside of the network security perimeter, or for access authenticated using API keys.
Add an inbound access rule
Inbound access rules can allow the internet and resources outside the perimeter to connect with resources inside the perimeter.
Network security perimeter supports two types of inbound access rules:
IP address ranges. IP addresses or ranges must be in the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format. An example of CIDR notation is 192.0.2.0/24, which represents the IPs that range from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255. This type of rule allows inbound requests from any IP address within the range.

Subscriptions. This type of rule allows inbound access authenticated using any managed identity from the subscription.

Add an outbound access rule
A search service makes outbound calls during indexer-based indexing and skillset execution. If your indexer data sources, Azure AI services, or custom skill logic is outside of the network security perimeter, you should create an outbound access rule that allows your search service to make the connection.
Recall that in public preview, Azure AI Search can only connect to Azure Storage or Azure Cosmos DB within the security perimeter. If your indexers use other data sources, you need an outbound access rule to support that connection.
Network security perimeter supports outbound access rules based on the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the destination. For example, you can allow outbound access from any service associated with your network security perimeter to an FQDN such asmystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net.
mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
