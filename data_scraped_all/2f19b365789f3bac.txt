Tip
To import or update work items in bulk, you can use either theweb portalor theCSV importfeature, which is the recommended approach.
Save time with Microsoft Excel when you need to add or modify many work items, add links and attachments to multiple work items, and more. You can also use native Excel features to perform actions such as summing a column, copying and pasting rows, filling down data into cells, and more.
For information about connecting to Excel, seeConnect Azure Boards to an Office client. For answers to specific questions about the integration of Excel and Azure DevOps, seeFAQs: Work in Excel connected to Azure Boards.
Note
macOS is not supported. Even with Visual Studio for Mac installed, connecting to Azure DevOps from Excel is not supported.
Prerequisites
For more information, seeCompatibility with Azure DevOps Server.
Use list and query types
You can add, modify, publish, and refresh work items using any query type and list type.
Use a flat listto bulk add or modify several types of work items at once, such as backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues.
Use a tree listto bulk add or modify work items and their tree-topology links.
Follow these best practices:
Input list, flat list: Import a list of work items or create new work items without hierarchy.
Input list, tree list: Complete top-down planning and import hierarchically linked work items.
Query list, tree list: View and modify the hierarchy of link relationships of many existing work items.
Query list, flat list: Bulk update a list of work items or create new work items without hierarchy.
Input list, flat list: Import a list of work items or create new work items without hierarchy.
Input list, tree list: Complete top-down planning and publish parent-child linked work items.
Query list, flat list: Create an Excel report based on the query of work items. To create an Excel report, your project collection must be configured to support Analytics reporting. For more information, seeCreate Excel reports from a work item query.
Query list, tree list: View and modify the hierarchy and parent-child link relationships of many existing work items.
Query types
Query types:
None: Indicates aninput list.
Query title: Indicates the list of work items is tied to the specifiedquery.
Azure Boards supports three query types, indicated by icons next to each query:
Flat list of work items: Imported as a flat list query.
Work items and direct links: Imported as a flat list query.
Tree of work items: Imported as a tree list.

Direct links queries are imported as a flat list into Excel, as modifying multiple types of links isn't supported in Excel.

Tree lists
You can bulk add a nested list of work items, such as a work breakdown structure or hierarchical user stories. For example, you can add a nested list of tasks, subtasks, and bugs, or link tasks to product backlog items.
List types:
Flat list: A simple list of work items with a singleTitlecolumn. No link management is supported.
Tree list: A hierarchical list of work items that supports creating and updating tree topology links, such as Parent-Child links, between work items. These lists include two or moreTitlecolumns.

Parent-child links or other tree topology link types support creating a hierarchical backlog structure. The work item types that participate in the hierarchy differ with different processes and are shown in the following images.
Hierarchies
Agile process
Basic process
Scrum process
CMMI process
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Agile process backlog work item:

User Stories and tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage Bug work items at the same level as User Story or Task work items. Use theWorking with bugssetting. For more information about using these work item types, seeAgile process.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Basic process backlog work item:

Issues and tasks are used to track work.
Epics are used to group work under larger scenarios.
The Basic process is available withAzure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1and later versions.
For more information about using these work item types, seePlan and track work.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the Scrum process backlog work item:

Product backlog items and Tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage bugs at the same level as product backlog items or Tasks. Use theWorking with bugssetting. For more information about using these work item types, seeScrum process.
The following image shows the hierarchy for the CMMI process backlog work item:

Requirements and Tasks are used to track work.
Bugs track code defects.
Epics and features are used to group work under larger scenarios.
Each team can configure how they manage bugs at the same level as requirements or tasks. Use theWorking with bugssetting. For more information about using these work item types, seeCMMI process.
To import a hierarchical list, seeAdd or import a hierarchical list of work itemslater in this article.
My queries versus shared queries
You can open any query you defined in Azure Boards in Excel, including queries under My Queries and Shared Queries. However, if you plan to share the workbook with other team members, use a Shared Query. Other team members can't access workbooks or worksheets based on personal queries stored under your My Queries folder.
Use Excel features
You can use most Excel features when you work with a list of work items.
Features:
Format a cell or apply conditional formatting to a cell or column
Cut and paste from one cell to other cells
Cut and paste a single row
Sum a column or add other formulas
Fill down cells
Filter
Add multiple worksheets to your workbook
Each worksheet in Excel can contain a different input list or query. However, all worksheets within the workbook must connect to the same project within an organization or project collection.
The following features behave differently when working with a worksheet connected to Azure Boards.
Each cell or column of cells corresponds to a work item field. Each field is associated with a data type. You can't enter data into an Excel cell that doesn't meet the data type and requirements for that field.
You can only insert a single row at a time within the worksheet.
You can copy and paste multiple rows within the worksheet.
To move a work item within a hierarchy, cut the entire row and paste it under the work item you want as its parent.
UseOutdentandIndentto change the location of a work item within the tree.
Undo (Ctrl Z) might not work. If you do something that you want to revert, you can refresh the worksheet.
We recommend you publish and refresh your worksheet often to make sure your local work remains in sync with Azure Boards data store. For more information about Excel, seeBasic Excel tasks.
Sort work items
You can sort work item flat lists using theExcel sort feature. But, if you're working from a tree list, you don't want to do any type of sort. Doing so changes the tree structure and as such, the links between work items.
If you want to use Excel to manage the order of your work items as they appear in ateam backlog, you can do that by using theStack RankorBacklog Priorityfield (Agile or Scrum process). You can set values in these fields, publish your worksheet, and refresh your backlog. Your backlog items should appear reordered based on lowest to highest number. However, the next time the backlog is reordered from the backlog, the values you entered are subject to change.
To maintain a specific order of work items, consider adding a custom field to manage the sort order. You can then use this field within Excel to sort your flat list of work items. This option doesn't change the order in which work items appear in your backlog.
Tasks you can and can't do with Excel
You can and can't do the following tasks from an Excel worksheet:
Can do:
Add tags and bulk update work items with tags as described inAdd work item tags to categorize and filter lists and boards. Add theTagsfield to your worksheet. Add multiple tags separated by a semicolon (;).
Add simple text to a rich-text field, but if you're updating several work items in bulk, you might lose formatting in existing work items.
Work offline and then reconnect and publish your changes. For more information, seeConnect Azure Boards to an Office client, Work offline, and reconnect.
Can't do:
Delete work items
Change the work item type of an existing work item
Move work items to another project
Import or update test case steps or other test artifacts
Add work items in any other State than the new State
Add to a work item discussion thread
Link to a remote work item.
Delete work items
Change the work item type of an existing work item
Move work items to another project
Import or update test case steps or other test artifacts

You can use theorindent/outdent icons to demote or promote a work item within the tree hierarchy. Ensure the header at the top of the column readsTitle n; if it doesn't, add a tree level.

Remove a tree level
First, publish changes that you made to work items before you remove a tree level. Removing a tree level requires a refresh, which overwrites data in the work item list. You lose any data you didn't publish.

Tips for working with a tree list
Excel uses the data in theTitlecolumns to determine the pattern of links between work items. When you publish changes, any of the following conditions can result in an error, an invalid link, or a tree link being created between incorrect work items:
A row between the work items is blank within the hierarchy.
The title of a work item is in the wrong column. Ensure you enter a title for each child work item.
MultipleTitlecolumns contain data within a row. Enter text in only one of the title columns per row.
The list was sorted. Avoid sorting a tree list, as it can change the hierarchical link relationships. If you do sort a tree list, recover by immediately refreshing.
To resolve an error, seeResolve invalid links.
Additionally, a parent-child linked work item can only have one parent. You can't add the same work item task to two backlog items. Instead, define distinct work item tasks.

Update work items in bulk with a query list
The easiest way to bulk update multiple work items is to create a query for the work items you want to update, and then open that query in Excel.
Tip
Keep your work in sync with these tips:
Use(Refresh) when you first open a saved worksheet to download the latest data from the data store.
Add columns to the worksheet using(Choose Columns) to enter data for additional fields.
Publish your additions and modifications often to avoid data conflicts.
Save your workbook periodically to prevent data loss before you publish or refresh.
From the web portal or Visual Studio, create the work item query that contains the work items you want to update. For more information, seeCreate and save managed queries with the query editor.

Enable Tree commands
If theTree groupcommands aren't available, your worksheet is configured as a flat or query list. To enable the Tree group commands, convert the list to either an input list or a list based on a tree query. For more information, see the next section onChange your list type or query.

Change your list type or query
You can change the work items listed in your worksheet. Specifically, you can:
Change your flat list to a tree list
Change from a query list to an input list
Change from an input list to a query list
Change the query your worksheet references
You can change your flat list to a tree list. However, if your list is a query list, you need to reconfigure it first. If theTree groupcommands are disabled, it indicates a flat or query list.

Resolve publishing errors
To resolve publishing errors that might arise when you're working in Excel, see one of the following articles:
Resolve data conflicts:
A data conflict occurs when a field value is changed in Azure Boards since the last time you published from Excel.
Resolve data validation errors:
A data validation error occurs if a field value violates the rules for that field and work item type.
Resolve invalid links in a tree hierarchy:
An invalid link happens when a work item in a hierarchy or tree list and is moved or sorted, breaking the dependencies between work items. To resolve this error, review the error message and reposition the work items to restore the correct structure.
Address Error TF208104: Hierarchical Link Relationship Is Locked:If you receive error TF208104, your changes to the fields are published, but changes to the link hierarchy aren't. This error occurs because another process locks at least one of the link relationships for the work item, such as Project Server integration.
