Transfer an Azure subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory

Organizations might have several Azure subscriptions. Each subscription is associated with a particular Microsoft Entra directory. To make management easier, you might want to transfer a subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory. When you transfer a subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory, some resources aren't transferred to the target directory. For example, all role assignments and custom roles in Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) arepermanentlydeleted from the source directory and aren't transferred to the target directory.
This article describes the basic steps you can follow to transfer a subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory and re-create some of the resources after the transfer.
Note
For Azure Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) subscriptions, changing the Microsoft Entra directory for the subscription isn't supported.
Overview
Transferring an Azure subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory is a complex process that must be carefully planned and executed. Many Azure services require security principals (identities) to operate normally or even manage other Azure resources. This article tries to cover most of the Azure services that depend heavily on security principals, but isn't comprehensive.
Important
In some scenarios, transferring a subscription might require downtime to complete the process. Careful planning is required to assess whether downtime will be required for your transfer.
The following diagram shows the basic steps you must follow when you transfer a subscription to a different directory.

Deciding whether to transfer a subscription to a different directory
The following are some reasons why you might want to transfer a subscription:
Because of a company merger or acquisition, you want to manage an acquired subscription in your primary Microsoft Entra directory.
Someone in your organization created a subscription and you want to consolidate management to a particular Microsoft Entra directory.
You have applications that depend on a particular subscription ID or URL and it isn't easy to modify the application configuration or code.
A portion of your business has been split into a separate company and you need to move some of your resources into a different Microsoft Entra directory.
You want to manage some of your resources in a different Microsoft Entra directory for security isolation purposes.
Alternate approaches
Transferring a subscription requires downtime to complete the process. Depending on your scenario, you can consider the following alternate approaches:
Re-create the resources and copy data to the target directory and subscription.
Adopt a multi-directory architecture and leave the subscription in the source directory. Use Azure Lighthouse to delegate resources so that users in the target directory can access the subscription in the source directory. For more information, seeAzure Lighthouse in enterprise scenarios.
How to block subscription transfers
Depending on your organization, you might want toblockthe transfer of subscriptions to different directories in your organization. If you want to instead block the transfer of subscriptions, you can configure a subscription policy. For more information, seeManage Azure subscription policies.
Understand the impact of transferring a subscription
Several Azure resources have a dependency on a subscription or a directory. Depending on your situation, the following table lists the known impact of transferring a subscription. By performing the steps in this article, you can re-create some of the resources that existed prior to the subscription transfer.
Important
This section lists the known Azure services or resources that depend on your subscription. Because resource types in Azure are constantly evolving, there might be additional dependencies not listed here that can cause a breaking change to your environment.
Warning
If you're using encryption at rest for a resource, such as a storage account or SQL database, that has a dependency on a key vault that is being transferred, it can lead to an unrecoverable scenario. If you have this situation, you should take steps to use a different key vault or temporarily disable customer-managed keys to avoid this unrecoverable scenario.
To get a list of some of the Azure resources that are impacted when you transfer a subscription, you can also run a query inAzure Resource Graph. For a sample query, seeList impacted resources when transferring an Azure subscription.
Prerequisites
To complete these steps, you will need:
Bash in Azure Cloud ShellorAzure CLI
Billing account owner of the subscription you want to transfer in the source directory
A user account in both the source and target directory for the user making the directory change
Step 1: Prepare for the transfer

List role assignments for managed identities
Managed identities don't get updated when a subscription is transferred to another directory. As a result, any existing system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities will be broken. After the transfer, you can re-enable any system-assigned managed identities. For user-assigned managed identities, you will have to re-create and attach them in the target directory.

List key vaults
When you create a key vault, it is automatically tied to the default Microsoft Entra tenant ID for the subscription in which it is created. All access policy entries are also tied to this tenant ID. For more information, seeMoving an Azure Key Vault to another subscription.
Warning
If you are using encryption at rest for a resource, such as a storage account or SQL database, that has a dependency on a key vault that is being transferred, it can lead to an unrecoverable scenario. If you have this situation, you should take steps to use a different key vault or temporarily disable customer-managed keys to avoid this unrecoverable scenario.

Step 2: Transfer the subscription
In this step, you transfer the subscription from the source directory to the target directory. The steps will be different depending on whether you want to also transfer the billing ownership.
Warning
When you transfer the subscription, all role assignments in the source directory arepermanentlydeleted and cannot be restored. You cannot go back once you transfer the subscription. Be sure you complete the previous steps before performing this step.

Review other security methods
Even though role assignments are removed during the transfer, users in the original owner account might continue to have access to the subscription through other security methods, including:
Access keys for services like Storage.
Management certificatesthat grant the user administrator access to subscription resources.
Remote Access credentials for services like Azure Virtual Machines.
If your intent is to remove access from users in the source directory so that they don't have access in the target directory, you should consider rotating any credentials. Until the credentials are updated, users will continue to have access after the transfer.
Rotate storage account access keys. For more information, seeManage storage account access keys.

If you are using access keys for other services such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Service Bus Messaging, rotate access keys.
