This article describes how to create and customize a recovery plan for failover inAzure Site Recovery. Before you start,learn moreabout recovery plans.
Create a recovery plan
In the Recovery Services vault, selectRecovery Plans (Site Recovery)>+Recovery Plan.

InCreate recovery plan, specify a name for the plan.

If you want to replicate different VMs to different subscriptions, please use more than one recovery plan (one or more for each target subscription).

You can include VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs managed by VMM, in the same plan.
VMware VMs and physical servers can be in the same plan.
All VMs in a recovery plan must replicate into a single subscription. If you want to replicate different VMs to different subscriptions, please use more than one recovery plan (one or more for each target subscription).
InSelect items virtual machines, select the machines (or replication group) that you want to add to the plan. Then clickOK.Machines are added default group (Group 1) in the  plan. After failover, all machines in this group start at the same time.You can only select machines are in the source and target locations that you specified.

ClickOKto create the plan.
Add a group to a plan
You create additional groups, and add machines to different groups so that you can specify different behavior on a group-by-group basis. For example, you can specify when machines in a group should start after failover, or specify customized actions per group.
InRecovery Plans, right-click the plan >Customize. By default, after creating a plan all the machines you added to it are located in default Group 1.
Click+Group. By default a new group is numbered in the order in which it's added. You can have up to seven groups.
Select the machine you want to move to the new group, clickChange group, and then select the new group. Alternatively, right-click the group name >Protected item, and add machines to the group. A machine or replication group can only belong to one group in a recovery plan.
Add a script or manual action
You can customize a recovery plan by adding a script or manual action. Note that:
If you're replicating to Azure you can integrate Azure automation runbooks into your recovery plan.Learn more.

If you're replicating Hyper-V VMs managed by System Center VMM, you can create a script on the on-premises VMM server, and include it in the recovery plan.
If you're replicating Hyper-V VMs managed by System Center VMM, you can create a script on the on-premises VMM server, and include it in the recovery plan.
When you add a script, it adds a new set of actions for the group. For example, a set of pre-steps for Group 1 is created with the nameGroup 1: pre-steps. All pre-steps are listed inside this set. You can add a script on the primary site only if you have a VMM server deployed.

If you add a manual action, when the recovery plan runs, it stops at the point at which you inserted the manual action. A dialog box prompts you to specify that the manual action was completed.

Scripts can be applied during failover to the secondary site, and during failback from the secondary site to the primary.

Scripts can be applied during failover to the secondary site, and during failback from the secondary site to the primary. Support depends on your replication scenario:
In the recovery plan, click the step to which the action should be added, and specify when the action should occur:If you want the action to occur before the machines in the group are started after failover, selectAdd pre-action.If you want the action to occur after the machines in the group start after failover, selectAdd post action. To move the position of the action, select theMove UporMove Downbuttons.
If you want the action to occur before the machines in the group are started after failover, selectAdd pre-action.
If you want the action to occur after the machines in the group start after failover, selectAdd post action. To move the position of the action, select theMove UporMove Downbuttons.
InInsert action, selectScriptorManual action.
If you want to add a manual action, do the following:Type in a name for the action, and type in action instructions. The person running the failover will see these instructions.Specify whether you want to add the manual action for all types of failover (Test, Failover, Planned failover (if relevant)). Then clickOK.

If you want to add a script, do the following:If you're adding a VMM script, selectFailover to VMM script, and inScript Pathtype the relative path to the share. For example, if the share is located at \<VMMServerName>\MSSCVMMLibrary\RPScripts, specify the path: \RPScripts\RPScript.PS1.If you're adding an Azure automation run book, specify theAzure Automation Accountin which the runbook is located, and select the appropriateAzure Runbook Script.

If you're adding an Azure automation run book, specify theAzure Automation Accountin which the runbook is located, and select the appropriateAzure Runbook Script.
Run a test failover of the recovery plan to ensure that the script works as expected.
