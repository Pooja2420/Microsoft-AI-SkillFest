A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change, minimizing the complexity of frequent updates to network security rules.
Important
While Service Tags simplify the ability to enable IP-based Access Control Lists (ACLs), Service Tags alone aren't sufficient to secure traffic without considering the nature of the service and the traffic it sends. For more information about IP based ACLs, seeWhat is an IP based access control list (ACL)?.
Additional information about the nature of the traffic can be found later in this article for each service and their tag. It's important to ensure you are familiar with the traffic that you allow when utilizing service tags for IP based ACLs. Consider added levels of security to protect your environment.
You can use service tags to define network access controls onnetwork security groups,Azure Firewall, and user-defined routes. Use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when you create security rules and routes. By specifying the service tag name, such asApiManagement, in the appropriatesourceordestinationfield of a security rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. By specifying the service tag name in the address prefix of a route, you can route traffic intended for any of the prefixes encapsulated by the service tag to a desired next hop type.
You can use service tags to achieve network isolation and protect your Azure resources from the general Internet while accessing Azure services that have public endpoints. Create inbound/outbound network security group rules to deny traffic to/fromInternetand allow traffic to/fromAzureCloudor otheravailable service tagsof specific Azure services.

Available service tags
The following table includes all the service tags available for use innetwork security grouprules.
The columns indicate whether the tag:
Is suitable for rules that cover inbound or outbound traffic.
Supportsregionalscope.
Is usable inAzure Firewallrules as adestinationrule only for inbound or outbound traffic.
By default, service tags reflect the ranges for the entire cloud. Some service tags also allow more granular control by restricting the corresponding IP ranges to a specified region. For example, the service tagStoragerepresents Azure Storage for the entire cloud, butStorage.WestUSnarrows the range to only the storage IP address ranges from the WestUS region. The following table indicates whether each service tag supports such regional scope, and the direction listed for each tag is a recommendation. For example, the AzureCloud tag may be used to allow inbound traffic. In most scenarios, we don't recommend allowing traffic from all Azure IPs since IPs used by other Azure customers are included as part of the service tag.
Note
When using service tags with Azure Firewall, you can only create destination rules on inbound and outbound traffic. Source rules are not supported. For more information, see theAzure Firewall Service Tagsdoc.

Service tags of Azure services denote the address prefixes from the specific cloud being used. For example, the underlying IP ranges that correspond to theSqltag value on the Azure Public cloud will be different from the underlying ranges on the Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet cloud.

If you implement avirtual network service endpointfor a service, such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database, Azure adds arouteto a virtual network subnet for the service. The address prefixes in the route are the same address prefixes, or CIDR ranges, as those of the corresponding service tag.

Tags supported in the classic deployment model
The classic deployment model (before Azure Resource Manager) supports a small subset of the tags listed in the previous table. The tags in the classic deployment model are spelled differently, as shown in the following table:

Service tags on-premises
You can obtain the current service tag and range information to include as part of your on-premises firewall configurations. This information is the current point-in-time list of the IP ranges that correspond to each service tag. You should obtain the information programmatically or via a JSON file download, as described in the following sections.
Use the Service Tag Discovery API
You can programmatically retrieve the current list of service tags together with IP address range details:
REST
REST
Azure PowerShell
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI

For example, to retrieve all the prefixes for the Storage Service Tag, you can use the following PowerShell cmdlets:
$serviceTags = Get-AzNetworkServiceTag -Location eastus2
$storage = $serviceTags.Values | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Storage" }
$storage.Properties.AddressPrefixes
$serviceTags = Get-AzNetworkServiceTag -Location eastus2
$storage = $serviceTags.Values | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Storage" }
$storage.Properties.AddressPrefixes
Note
The API data represents those tags that can be used with NSG rules in your region. Use the API data as the source of truth for available Service Tags as it may be different than the JSON downloadable file.
It takes up to 4 weeks for new Service Tag data to propagate in the API results across all Azure regions. Because of this process, your API data results may be out of sync with the downloadable JSON file as the API data represents a subset of the tags currently in the downloadable JSON file.
You must be authenticated and have a role with read permissions for your current subscription.
Discover service tags by using downloadable JSON files
You can download JSON files that contain the current list of service tags together with IP address range details. These lists are updated and published weekly. Locations for each cloud are:
Azure Public
Azure Public
Azure US Government
Azure US Government
Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet

Azure Germany

The IP address ranges in these files are in CIDR notation.

Tip
You can detect updates from one publication to the next by noting increasedchangeNumbervalues in the JSON file. Each subsection (for example,Storage.WestUS) has its ownchangeNumberthat's incremented as changes occur. The top level of the file'schangeNumberis incremented when any of the subsections is changed.

For examples of how to parse the service tag information (for example, get all address ranges for Storage in WestUS), see theService Tag Discovery API PowerShelldocumentation.

When new IP addresses are added to service tags, they won't be used in Azure for at least one week. This gives you time to update any systems that might need to track the IP addresses associated with service tags.
