On September 30, 2025, Microsoft Azure will retire the Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3 and Standard_NC24s_v3 virtual machines (VMs) in NCv3-series virtual machines (VMs). To avoid any disruption to your service, we recommend that you change the VM sizing for your workloads from the current NCv3-series VMs to the newer VM series in the same NC product line.
Microsoft is recommending, the AzureNC A100 v4-seriesVMs, which offer greater GPU memory bandwidth per GPU, improvedAccelerated Networkingcapabilities, larger and faster local solid state drives. Overall the NC A100 v4-series deliversbetter cost performanceacross midrange AI training and inference workloads.
Other VMs that may be migrated to from Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3, and Standard_NC24s_v3 include NVadsA10_v5, NCads_H100_v5, NCasT4_v3, and NVadsV710_v5.
How does the retirement of the NC6s_v3, NC12s_v3, NC24s_v3 virtual machine sizes in NCv3-series affect me?
AfterSeptember 30th, any remainingStandard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3 and Standard_NC24s_v3 virtual machines (VMs) subscriptions will be set to a deallocated state. They'll stop working and no longer incur billing charges. The NCv3 will no longer be under SLA or have support included.
Note
This retirement only impacts the virtual machine sizes in the original NCv3-series powered by NVIDIA V100 GPUs.See Standard_NC24rs_v3 retirement guide. This retirement announcement doesn't apply to NCasT4 v3, and NC A100 v4 and NCads H100 v5 series virtual machines.
What action do I need to take before the retirement date?
You need to resize or deallocate your Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3 and Standard_NC24s_v3 VMs. We recommend that you change VM sizes for these workloads, from the original Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3 and Standard_NC24s_v3 VMs to the NC A100 v4-series (or an alternative).
TheNC A100 v4 seriesis powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and 3rd generation AMD EPYCâ¢ 7V13 (Milan) processors. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80 GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. CheckAzure Regions by Product pagefor region availability. Visit theAzure Virtual Machine pricing pagefor pricing information.
TheNCads H100 v5-Seriesis another SKU in the same product line powered by NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU. These VMs are targeted for GPU accelerated midrange AI training, batch inferencing, and high performance computing simulation workloads.
Steps to change VM size
Choose a series and size. Refer to the above tables for Microsoftâs recommendation. You can also file a support request if more assistance is needed.
Request quota for the new target VM.
You canresize the virtual machine.
