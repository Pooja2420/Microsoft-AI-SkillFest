Azure DevOps Services
Setting up billing in Azure DevOps is essential for managing costs associated with users, CI/CD concurrency, and extensions. This article guides you through the process toset up billing,change your Azure subscription,remove your billing subscription, andgive a user access to manage billing.
All services are billed via Azure. You're not required to use any other Azure services.
Important
When you remove the billing subscription from your organization, any paid quantities for the following types of users go back to thefree tierof service immediately:BasicAzure ArtifactsAzure Test PlansMicrosoft-hosted CI/CDSelf-hosted CI/CD

Azure Artifacts
Azure Test Plans
Microsoft-hosted CI/CD
Self-hosted CI/CD
Before you delete your organization resource in the Azure portal, ensure you changed the billing subscription. Deleting the resource before this change might result in reverting to the free tier of service for your organization. For more information, seeBilling FAQs.
When billing gets canceled or changed, a resource group gets left behind in the old Azure subscription. Despite Azure's warning that "Dependent resources will be deleted," it's safe to delete these resource groups. The Azure DevOps organization won't be deleted or harmed. These resource groups take the naming format,VisualStudioOnline-<DEVOPS-ORG-HOSTID-WITHOUT-DASHES>.
VisualStudioOnline-<DEVOPS-ORG-HOSTID-WITHOUT-DASHES>

Tip
If your desired Azure Subscription doesn't display, itâs likely because the Azure subscription youâre trying to use is tied to a different Microsoft Entra ID tenant than the one you use to access your Azure DevOps organization. Do the following steps to ensure this Azure Subscription shows when you're configuring billing:
Go directly to your profile (https://aex.dev.azure.com/).

Classic admins retired August 31, 2024. You can't add a new coadministrator using the Access control. Remove coadministrators and use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control. For more information, seeAzure classic subscription administrators.
Assign any of the following roles to a user under the subscription your organization uses for billing:Owner,Contributor, orService admin. For more information, seeAzure roles.
