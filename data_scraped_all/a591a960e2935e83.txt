This article explains how to plan, configure, and optimize monitoring across Azure while integrating data from other clouds, on-premises, and edge environments. Monitoring your Azure cloud estate involves continuously observing and analyzing the performance, health, and security of your cloud resources and applications.

Identify your monitoring scope
Monitoring responsibilities vary by deployment model. Use the following table to identify your monitoring responsibilities for infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), software (SaaS), and on-premises deployments.
Plan your monitoring strategy
A monitoring strategy outlines your requirements across every environment. The goal of monitoring is to detect and respond to issues in real time, diagnose current or past issues, and predict and prevent future issues. Here's how:
Define your monitoring approach.Choose a centralized or shared management model based on your organization's size and complexity.Monitoring approachResponsibilities and scopeBest forProsConsCentralizedManage all monitoring tasks centrally.Startups or small cloud footprint.Simplified governance and cost control.Potential for operational bottlenecks.Shared managementCentrally monitor health, security, compliance, cost, data, and shared services.Workload teams monitor workloads.Enterprises with multiple workloads.Balances governance with workload-level agility.Improves response speed and accountability.Requires clear role definitions and ongoing coordination.For shared management monitoring responsibilities, see an exampleShared management monitoring responsibilities.

Define data collection requirements.Determine which metrics and logs you must collect for compliance, security, and effective issue diagnosis. Meet regulatory compliance requirements and all internal governance rules. If you don't know what to collect, gather all available logs and metrics to avoid data gaps. It's a short-term solution that isn't cost efficient. When you have enough data, use theAzure Pricing Calculatorto estimate the cost of the collection long term and adjust the collection settings to meet your budget. Refer to thecomplete list of Azure monitoring documentation linksto learn more about what you should collect on every Azure service and how to configure it.

Design a monitoring solution
Designing a monitoring solution refers to creating a system for collecting and storing logs, metrics, and insights. A well-designed solution helps satisfy operational, security, and compliance needs. Here's how:
Consolidate your monitoring solutions.Use one platform to monitor Azure and on-premises, public cloud, and edge environments as needed. This consolidated approach streamlines your operations, prevents frequent tool-switching, and enables your team to detect and resolve issues quickly. UseAzure Monitoras your main monitoring solution. UseAzure Arcto collect data from other clouds, on-premises, and edge deployments. Use availableAzure monitoring toolsand send their data to Azure Monitor for centralized visibility.

Aim to centralize monitoring data.Prefer fewer locations for storing logs and metrics. Fewer locations make it easier to manage and correlate data. There are reasons to have multiple locations to store and analyze monitoring data. For example, security operations, data residency, data resiliency, and number of Azure tenants are all factors that could require you to store your monitoring data in multiple locations. For more information, seeDesign a Log Analytics workspace architecture.

Monitor code and runtime
At the workload level, you need to gather telemetry (application logs, metrics, and traces) on your application code and execution to identify issues and optimize performance. For workloads in Azure, useApplication Insightsto collect runtime telemetry (instrumentation), so you can identify performance bottlenecks and errors. For workload-specific code and run monitoring guidance, see the Well-Architected Framework:
Monitor cloud resources
Monitoring cloud resources covers watching control-plane activity, resource logs, and performance metrics across Azure. You want detailed visibility into resource usage and changes to maintain security, compliance, and operational excellence. Here's how:
Monitor control plane activities.You need know who created, updated, and deleted resources in your cloud environment. In Azure, you want to monitor control plane activities in across your subscriptions. Azure automatically captures control-plane events for each subscription, calledAzure Activity Logs.Create a diagnostic settingto send these Activity Logs to the right destination

Collect cloud resource logs.You need to collect log data for each cloud resource to assess its health and troubleshoot effectively. Different services have different types of logs. In Azure, you must configureAzure resource logson every service to collect them. If you don't know what to collect, gather all available logs and metrics to avoid data gaps and optimize cost later. To optimize cost, adjust the retention period and eliminate certain logs from collection if unneeded. The logs you collect and how long you keep them should balance cost with compliance, security, and business continuity (root cause analysis).

Notify stakeholders.Identify who should receive a notification when an alert triggers. A decentralized approach routes relevant alerts to the right people. Start with a flexible method that alerts stakeholders when a resource approaches anomalous behavior. Configure at least one action group for each subscription. This approach ensures relevant personnel receive alerts. Include an email notification channel as a minimum requirement. Notify operations teams about lower-severity alerts and notify management about high-severity alerts. For more information, seecustomize alerts with Azure Logic Appsand integrate withIT service management product (ITSM).
