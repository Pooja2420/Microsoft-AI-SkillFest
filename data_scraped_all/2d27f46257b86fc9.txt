Privileged Identity Management (PIM)provides a time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions to important resources. These resources include resources in Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.
PIM enables you to allow a specific set of actions at a particular scope. Key features include:

To gain the most from this deployment plan, itâs important that you get a complete overview ofWhat is Privileged Identity Management.
Understand PIM
The PIM concepts in this section help you understand your organizationâs privileged identity requirements.
What can you manage in PIM
Today, you can use PIM with:
Microsoft Entra rolesâ Sometimes referred to as directory roles, Microsoft Entra roles include built-in, and custom roles to manage Microsoft Entra ID and other Microsoft 365 online services.
Microsoft Entra rolesâ Sometimes referred to as directory roles, Microsoft Entra roles include built-in, and custom roles to manage Microsoft Entra ID and other Microsoft 365 online services.
Azure rolesâ The role-based access control (RBAC) roles in Azure that grants access to management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.
Azure rolesâ The role-based access control (RBAC) roles in Azure that grants access to management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.
PIM for Groupsâ To set up just-in-time access to member and owner role of a Microsoft Entra security group. PIM for Groups not only gives you an alternative way to set up PIM for Microsoft Entra roles and Azure roles, but also allows you to set up PIM for other permissions across Microsoft online services like Intune, Azure Key Vaults, and Azure Information Protection. If the group is configured for app provisioning, activation of group membership triggers provisioning of group membership (and the user account, if it wasnât provisioned) to the application using the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol.

You can assign the following to these roles or groups:
Users- To get just-in-time access to Microsoft Entra roles, Azure roles, and PIM for Groups.
Users- To get just-in-time access to Microsoft Entra roles, Azure roles, and PIM for Groups.
Groups- Anyone in a group to get just-in-time access to Microsoft Entra roles and Azure roles. For Microsoft Entra roles, the group must be a newly created cloud group thatâs marked as assignable to a role while for Azure roles, the group can be any Microsoft Entra security group. We don't recommend assigning/nesting a group to a PIM for Groups.

We don't recommend assigning/nesting a group to a PIM for Groups.
Note
You cannot assign service principals as eligible to Microsoft Entra roles, Azure roles, and PIM for Groups but you can grant a time limited active assignment to all three.
Principle of least privilege
You assign users the role with theleast privileges necessary to perform their tasks. This practice minimizes the number of Global Administrators and instead uses specific administrator roles for certain scenarios.
Note
Microsoft has very few Global Administrators. Learn more athow Microsoft uses Privileged Identity Management.
Type of assignments
There are two types of assignment âeligibleandactive. If a user is eligible for a role, they can activate the role when they need to perform privileged tasks.
You can also set a start and end time for each type of assignment. This addition gives you four possible types of assignments:
Permanent eligible
Permanent eligible
Permanent active
Permanent active
Time-bound eligible, with specified start and end dates for assignment
Time-bound eligible, with specified start and end dates for assignment
Time-bound active, with specified start and end dates for assignment
Time-bound active, with specified start and end dates for assignment
In case the role expires, you canextendorrenewthese assignments.
We recommendyou keep zero permanently active assignments for roles other than youremergency access accounts.
Microsoft recommends that organizations have two cloud-only emergency access accounts permanently assigned theGlobal Administratorrole. These accounts are highly privileged and aren't assigned to specific individuals. The accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass" scenarios where normal accounts can't be used or all other administrators are accidentally locked out. These accounts should be created following theemergency access account recommendations.
Plan the project
When technology projects fail, itâs typically because of mismatched expectations on impact, outcomes, and responsibilities. To avoid these pitfalls,ensure that youâre engaging the right stakeholdersand that stakeholder roles in the project are well understood.
Plan a pilot
At each stage of your deployment ensure that you are evaluating that the results are as expected. Seebest practices for a pilot.
Start with a small set of users (pilot group) and verify that the PIM behaves as expected.

Plan communications
Communication is critical to the success of any new service. Proactively communicate with your users how their experience changes, when it changes, and how to gain support if they experience issues.
Set up time with your internal IT support to walk them through the PIM workflow. Provide them with the appropriate documentations and your contact information.
Plan testing and rollback
Note
For Microsoft Entra roles, organizations often test and roll out Global Administrators first, while for Azure resources, they usually test PIM one Azure subscription at a time.
Plan testing
Create test users to verify PIM settings work as expected before you impact real users and potentially disrupt their access to apps and resources. Build a test plan to have a comparison between the expected results and the actual results.
The following table shows an example test case:
Require MFA
Require approval
Require Conditional Access context (Public preview)
Approver receives notification and can approve
Role expires after preset time
For both Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource role, make sure that you have users represented who will take those roles. In addition, consider the following roles when you test PIM in your staged environment:
Plan rollback
If PIM fails to work as desired in the production environment, you can change the role assignment from eligible to active once again. For each role that youâve configured, select the ellipsis(â¦)for all users with assignment type aseligible. You can then select theMake activeoption to go back and make the role assignmentactive.

Plan and implement PIM for Microsoft Entra roles
Follow these tasks to prepare PIM to manage Microsoft Entra roles.
Discover and mitigate privileged roles
List who has privileged roles in your organization. Review the users assigned, identify administrators who no longer need the role, and remove them from their assignments.
You can useMicrosoft Entra roles access reviewsto automate the discovery, review, and approval or removal of assignments.
Determine roles to be managed by PIM
Prioritize protecting Microsoft Entra roles that have the most permissions. Itâs also important to consider what data and permission are most sensitive for your organization.
First, ensure that all Global Administrator and Security Administrator roles are managed using PIM because theyâre the users who can do the most harm when compromised. Then consider more roles that should be managed that could be vulnerable to attack.

You can use the Privileged label to identify roles with high privileges that you can manage with PIM. Privileged label is present onRoles and Administratorin Microsoft Entra admin center. See the article,Microsoft Entra built-in rolesto learn more.
Configure PIM settings for Microsoft Entra roles
Draft and configure your PIM settingsfor every privileged Microsoft Entra role that your organization uses.
The following table shows example settings:

Assign and activate Microsoft Entra roles
For Microsoft Entra roles in PIM, only a user who is in the Privileged Role Administrator or Global Administrator role can manage assignments for other administrators. Global Administrators, Security Administrators, Global Readers, and Security Readers can also view assignments to Microsoft Entra roles in PIM.
Follow the instructions in each of the following steps:
Give eligible assignments.
Give eligible assignments.
Allow eligible users to activate their Microsoft Entra role just-in-time
Allow eligible users to activate their Microsoft Entra role just-in-time
When role nears its expiration, usePIM to extend or renew the roles. Both user-initiated actions require an approval from a Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator.
When these important events occur in Microsoft Entra roles, PIMsends email notifications and weekly digest emailsto privilege administrators depending on the role, event, and notification settings. These emails might also include links to relevant tasks, such activating or renewing a role.
Note
You can also perform these PIM tasksusing the Microsoft Graph APIs for Microsoft Entra roles.
Approve or deny PIM activation requests
A delegated approver receives an email notification when a request is pending for approval. Follow these steps toapprove or deny requests to activate an Azure resource role.

View audit history for Microsoft Entra roles
View audit history for all role assignments and activationswithin past 30 days for Microsoft Entra roles. You can access the audit logs if you are a Global Administrator or a Privileged Role Administrator.
We recommendyou have at least one administrator read through all audit events on a weekly basis and export your audit events on a monthly basis.

Security alerts for Microsoft Entra roles
Configure security alerts for Microsoft Entra rolesto trigger an alert in the event of suspicious and unsafe activity.
Plan and implement PIM for Azure Resource roles
Follow these tasks to prepare PIM to manage Azure resource roles.
Discover and mitigate privileged roles
Minimize Owner and User Access Administrator assignments attached to each subscription or resource and remove unnecessary assignments.
As a Global Administrator you canelevate access to manage all Azure subscriptions. You can then find each subscription owner and work with them to remove unnecessary assignments within their subscriptions.
Useaccess reviews for Azure resourcesto audit and remove unnecessary role assignments.
Determine roles to be managed by PIM
When deciding which role assignments should be managed using PIM for Azure resource, you must first identify themanagement groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources that are most vital for your organization. Consider using management groups to organize all their resources within their organization.
We recommendyou manage all Subscription Owner and User Access Administrator roles using PIM.
Work with Subscription owners to document resources managed by each subscription and classify the risk level of each resource if compromised. Prioritize managing resources with PIM based on risk level. This also includes custom resources attached to the subscription.
We also recommendyou work with Subscription or Resource owners of critical services to set up PIM workflow for all the roles inside sensitive subscriptions or resources.
For subscriptions or resources that arenât as critical, you wonât need to set up PIM for all roles. However, you should still protect the Owner and User Access Administrator roles with PIM.
Configure PIM settings for Azure Resource roles
Draft and configure settingsfor the Azure Resource roles that youâve planned to protect with PIM.
The following table shows example settings:
Assign and activate Azure Resource role
For Azure resource roles in PIM, only an owner or User Access Administrator can manage assignments for other administrators. Users who are Privileged Role Administrators, Security Administrators, or Security Readers don't by default have access to view assignments to Azure resource roles.
Follow the instructions in the links below:
1.Give eligible assignments
2.Allow eligible users to activate their Azure roles just-in-time
When privileged role assignment nears its expiration,use PIM to extend or renew the roles. Both user-initiated actions require an approval from the resource owner or User Access Administrator.
When these important events occur in Azure resource roles, PIM sendsemail notificationsto Owners and Users Access Administrators. These emails might also include links to relevant tasks, such activating or renewing a role.
Note
You can also perform these PIM tasksusing the Microsoft Azure Resource Manager APIs for Azure resource roles.
Approve or deny PIM activation requests
Approve or deny activation requests for Microsoft Entra role- A delegated approver receives an email notification when a request is pending for approval.
View audit history for Azure Resource roles
View audit history for all assignments and activationswithin past 30 days for Azure resource roles.
Security alerts for Azure Resource roles
Configure security alerts for the Azure resource roleswhich triggers an alert in case of any suspicious and unsafe activity.
Plan and implement PIM for PIM for Groups
Follow these tasks to prepare PIM to manage PIM for Groups.
Discover PIM for Groups
Someone could have five or six eligible assignments to Microsoft Entra roles through PIM. They have to activate each role individually, which can reduce productivity. Worse still, they can also have tens or hundreds of Azure resources assigned to them, which aggravates the problem.
In this case, you should use PIM for Groups. Create a PIM for Groups and grant it permanent active access to multiple roles. SeePrivileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups (preview).
To manage a Microsoft Entra role-assignable group as a PIM for Groups, you mustbring it under management in PIM.
Configure PIM settings for PIM for Groups
Draft and configure settingsfor the PIM for Groups that you plan to protect with PIM.
The following table shows example settings:
Assign eligibility for PIM for Groups
You canassign eligibility to members or owners of PIM for Groups.With just one activation, they have access to all linked resources.
Note
You can assign the group to one or more Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles in the same way as you assign roles to users. A maximum of 500 role-assignable groups can be created in a single Microsoft Entra organization (tenant).

When group assignment nears its expiration, usePIM to extend or renew the group assignment. This operation requires group owner approval.
Approve or deny PIM activation request
Configure PIM for Groups members and owners to require approval for activation and choose users or groups from your Microsoft Entra organization as delegated approvers. We recommend selecting two or more approvers for each group to reduce workload for the Privileged Role Administrator.
Approve or deny role activation requests for PIM for Groups. Delegated approvers receive email notifications when a request is awaiting approval.
View audit history for PIM for Groups
View audit history for all assignments and activationswithin past 30 days for PIM for Groups.
