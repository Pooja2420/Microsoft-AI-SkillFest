This article explains how to manage access (authorization) to Azure Machine Learning workspaces. You can useAzure role-based access control(Azure RBAC) to manage access to Azure resources, giving users the ability to create new resources or use existing ones. Users in your Microsoft Entra ID are assigned specific roles, which grant access to resources. Azure provides both built-in roles and the ability to create custom roles.
Tip
While this article focuses on Azure Machine Learning, individual services provide their own RBAC settings. For example, using the information in this article, you can configure who can submit scoring requests to a model deployed as a web service on Azure Kubernetes Service. But Azure Kubernetes Service provides its own set of Azure roles. For service specific RBAC information that might be useful with Azure Machine Learning, see the following links:
Use Kubernetes role-based access control with Microsoft Entra ID
Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization
Assign an Azure role for access to blob data
Warning
Applying some roles might limit UI functionality in Azure Machine Learning studio for other users. For example, if a user's role doesn't have the ability to create a compute instance, the option to create a compute instance isn't available in studio. This behavior is expected, and prevents the user from attempting operations that would return an access denied error.
Default roles
Azure Machine Learning workspaces have built-in roles that are available by default. When you add users to a workspace, they can be assigned one of the following roles.
In addition,Azure Machine Learning registrieshave an Azure Machine Learning Registry User role that can be assigned to a registry resource to grant user-level permissions to data scientists. For administrator-level permissions to create or delete registries, use the Contributor or Owner role.
You can combine the roles to grant different levels of access. For example, you can grant a workspace user bothAzureML Data ScientistandAzureML Compute Operatorroles to permit the user to perform experiments while creating computes in a self-service manner.
Important
Role access can be scoped to multiple levels in Azure. For example, someone with owner access to a workspace may not have owner access to the resource group that contains the workspace. For more information, seeHow Azure RBAC works.
Azure AI Administrator role (preview)
Prior to 11/19/2024, the system-assigned managed identity created for the workspace was automatically assigned theContributorrole for the resource group that contains the workspace. Workspaces created after this date have the system-assigned managed identity assigned to theAzure AI Administratorrole. This role is more narrowly scoped to the minimum permissions needed for the managed identity to perform its tasks.
TheAzure AI Administratorrole is currently in public preview. If you encounter issues when using the Azure AI Administrator role with your workspace's managed identity, you can tryreverting to the Contributor role.
TheAzure AI Administratorrole is currently in public preview.
Important
This feature is currently in public preview. This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
For more information, seeSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.
TheAzure AI Administratorrole has the following permissions:

Convert an existing system-managed identity to the Azure AI Administrator role
Tip
We recommend that you convert workspaces created before 11/19/2024 to use the Azure AI Administrator role. The Azure AI Administrator role is more narrowly scoped than the previously used Contributor role and follows the principal of least privilege.
You can convert workspaces created before 11/19/2024 by using one of the following methods:
Azure REST API: Use aPATCHrequest to the Azure REST API for the workspace. The body of the request should set{"properties":{"allowRoleAssignmeentOnRG":true}}. The following example shows aPATCHrequest usingcurl. Replace<your-subscription>,<resource-group-name>,<workspace-name>, and<YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>with the values for your scenario. For more information on using REST APIs, visit theAzure REST API documentation.curl -X PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<your-subscription>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace-name>?api-version=2024-04-01-preview -H "Authorization:Bearer <YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>"

Azure CLI: Use theaz ml workspace updatecommand with the--allow-roleassignment-on-rg trueparameter. The following example updates a workspace namedmyworkspace. This command requires the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension version 2.27.0 or later.az ml workspace update --name myworkspace --allow-roleassignment-on-rg true

myworkspace
az ml workspace update --name myworkspace --allow-roleassignment-on-rg true

Azure Python SDK: Set theallow_roleassignment_on_rgproperty of the Workspace object toTrueand then perform an update operation. The following example updates a workspace namedmyworkspace. This operation requires the Azure Machine Learning SDK version 1.17.0 or later.ws = ml_client.workspaces.get(name="myworkspace")
ws.allow_roleassignment_on_rg = True
ws = ml_client.workspaces.begin_update(workspace=ws).result()

ws.allow_roleassignment_on_rg = True
ws = ml_client.workspaces.begin_update(workspace=ws).result()
Manage workspace access
If you're an owner of a workspace, you can add and remove roles for the workspace. You can also assign roles to users. Use the following links to discover how to manage access:
Azure portal UI
PowerShell
Azure CLI
REST API
Azure Resource Manager templates
For example, use theAzure CLIto assignContributorrole tojoe@contoso.comfor resource groupthis-rgwith the following command:
az role assignment create --role "Contributor" --assignee "joe@contoso.com" --resource-group this-rg
az role assignment create --role "Contributor" --assignee "joe@contoso.com" --resource-group this-rg

Use Microsoft Entra security groups to manage workspace access
You can use Microsoft Entra security groups to manage access to workspaces. This approach has following benefits:
Team or project leaders can manage user access to workspace as security group owners, without needing Owner role on the workspace resource directly.
You can organize, manage, and revoke users' permissions on workspace and other resources as a group, without having to manage permissions on user-by-user basis.
Using Microsoft Entra groups helps you to avoid reaching thesubscription limiton role assignments.
To use Microsoft Entra security groups:
Create a security group.
Add a group owner. This user has permissions to add or remove group members. The group owner isn't required to be group member, or have direct RBAC role on the workspace.
Assign the group an RBAC role on the workspace, such asAzureML Data Scientist,Reader, orContributor.
Add group members. The members gain access to the workspace.
Create custom role
If the built-in roles are insufficient, you can create custom roles. Custom roles might possess read, write, delete, and compute resource permissions in that workspace. You can make the role available at a specific workspace level, a specific resource group level, or a specific subscription level.
Note
You must be an owner of the resource at that level to create custom roles within that resource.
To create a custom role, first construct a role definition JSON file that specifies the permission and scope for the role. The following example defines a custom Data Scientist Custom role scoped at a specific workspace level:
data_scientist_custom_role.json:
{
    "Name": "Data Scientist Custom",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Can run experiment but can't create or delete compute.",
    "Actions": ["*"],
    "NotActions": [
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/delete", 
        "Microsoft.Authorization/*/write"
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspaceName>"
    ]
}
{
    "Name": "Data Scientist Custom",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Can run experiment but can't create or delete compute.",
    "Actions": ["*"],
    "NotActions": [
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/write",
        "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/delete", 
        "Microsoft.Authorization/*/write"
    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspaceName>"
    ]
}
Tip
You can change theAssignableScopesfield to set the scope of this custom role at the subscription level, the resource group level, or a specific workspace level.
The previous custom role is just an example, see some suggestedcustom roles for the Azure Machine Learning service.
AssignableScopes
This custom role can do everything in the workspace except for the following actions:
It can't delete the workspace.
It can't create or update the workspace.
It can't create or update compute resources.
It can't delete compute resources.
It can't add, delete, or alter role assignments.
To deploy this custom role, use the following Azure CLI command:
az role definition create --role-definition data_scientist_custom_role.json
az role definition create --role-definition data_scientist_custom_role.json
After deployment, this role becomes available in the specified workspace. Now you can add and assign this role in the Azure portal.
For more information on custom roles, seeAzure custom roles.
Azure Machine Learning operations
For more information on the operations (actions and not actions) usable with custom roles, seeResource provider operations. You can also use the following Azure CLI command to list operations:
az provider operation show ân Microsoft.MachineLearningServices
az provider operation show ân Microsoft.MachineLearningServices
List custom roles
In the Azure CLI, run the following command:
az role definition list --subscription <subscriptionId> --custom-role-only true
az role definition list --subscription <subscriptionId> --custom-role-only true
To view the role definition for a specific custom role, use the following Azure CLI command. The<roleName>should be in the same format returned by the previous command:
<roleName>
az role definition list -n <roleName> --subscription <subscriptionId>
az role definition list -n <roleName> --subscription <subscriptionId>
Update a custom role
In the Azure CLI, run the following command:
az role definition update --role-definition update_def.json --subscription <subscriptionId>
az role definition update --role-definition update_def.json --subscription <subscriptionId>
You need to have permissions on the entire scope of your new role definition. For example if this new role has a scope across three subscriptions, you need to have permissions on all three subscriptions.
Note
Role updates can take 15 minutes to an hour to apply across all role assignments in that scope.
Use Azure Resource Manager templates for repeatability
If you anticipate that you need to recreate complex role assignments, an Azure Resource Manager template can be a significant help. Themachine-learning-dependencies-role-assignment templateshows how role assignments can be specified in source code for reuse.
Common scenarios
The following table is a summary of Azure Machine Learning activities and the permissions required to perform them at the least scope. For example, if an activity can be performed with a workspace scope (Column 4), then all higher scope with that permission also work automatically. For certain activities, the permissions differ between V1 and V2 APIs.

Deploy into a virtual network or subnet
To deploy resources into a virtual network or subnet, your user account must have permissions to the following actions in Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC):"Microsoft.Network/*/read" on the virtual network resource. This permission isn't needed for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deployments."Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/join/action" on the virtual network resource."Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action" on the subnet resource.For more information on Azure RBAC with networking, see theNetworking built-in roles

"Microsoft.Network/*/read" on the virtual network resource. This permission isn't needed for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template deployments.
"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/join/action" on the virtual network resource.
"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action" on the subnet resource.
For more information on Azure RBAC with networking, see theNetworking built-in roles
Differences between actions for V1 and V2 APIs
There are certain differences between actions for V1 APIs and V2 APIs.
You can make custom roles compatible with both V1 and V2 APIs by including both actions, or using wildcards that include both actions, for exampleMicrosoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/datasets/*/read.
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/datasets/*/read
Create a workspace using a customer-managed key
When you use a customer-managed key (CMK), an Azure Key Vault is used to store the key. The user or service principal used to create the workspace must have owner or contributor access to the key vault.
If your workspace is configured with auser-assigned managed identity, the identity must be granted the following roles. These roles allow the managed identity to create the Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Search resources used when using a customer-managed key:
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write
Microsoft.Search/searchServices/write
Microsoft.Search/searchServices/write
Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/write
Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/write
Within the key vault, the user or service principal must havecreate,get,delete, andpurgeaccess to the key through a key vault access policy. For more information, seeAzure Key Vault security.
User-assigned managed identity with Azure Machine Learning compute cluster
To assign a user assigned identity to an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster, you need write permissions to create the compute and theManaged Identity Operator Role. For more information on Azure RBAC with Managed Identities, readHow to manage user assigned identity
MLflow operations
To perform MLflow operations with your Azure Machine Learning workspace, use the following scopes your custom role:
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/experiments/*
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/jobs/*
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/*/read
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/*/write
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/models/*/delete

Troubleshooting
Here are a few things to be aware of while you use Azure RBAC:
When you create a resource in Azure, such as a workspace, you're not directly the owner of the resource. Your role is inherited from the highest scope role that you're authorized against in that subscription. As an example, if you're a Network Administrator and have the permissions to create a Machine Learning workspace, you would be assigned theNetwork Administratorrole against that workspace. Not theOwnerrole.

As an example, if you're a Network Administrator and have the permissions to create a Machine Learning workspace, you would be assigned theNetwork Administratorrole against that workspace. Not theOwnerrole.
To perform quota operations in a workspace, you need subscription level permissions. This means setting either subscription level quota or workspace level quota for your managed compute resources can only happen if you have write permissions at the subscription scope.

Revert to the Contributor role
If you create a new workspace and encounter errors with the new default role assignment of Azure AI Administrator for the workspace managed identity, use the following steps to revert to the Contributor role:
Important
We don't recommend reverting to the Contributor role unless you encounter problems. If reverting a workspace does solve the problems that you are encountering, please log a support incident with information on the problems that reverting solved so that we can invesitage further.
If you would like to revert to the Contributor role as thedefaultfor new workspaces, open asupport requestwith your Azure subscription details and request that your subscription be changed to use the Contributor role as the default for the system-assigned managed identity of new workspaces.
