In YAML pipelines, you can rerun a successful stage, but it triggers all stages that depend on it to rerun as well.
One use case for rerunning a stage is to roll back to a previous version of your system.
That is, you can choose an older version of the pipeline and wish to rerun a particular stage, and only that one.
Today, you can achieve simulate rerunning a single stage by making use of environments and approvals or theManualValidationtask, but doing so is tedious.
We plan to give you the ability to rerun a single stage, without causing following stages to rerun too.
