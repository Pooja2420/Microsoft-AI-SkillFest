Microsoft Defender for Cloud generates detailed security alerts and recommendations. To analyze the information that's in these alerts and recommendations, you can export them to Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, to Azure Event Hubs, or to another Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR), or IT classicdeployment model solution. You can stream the alerts and recommendations as they're generated or define a schedule to send periodic snapshots of all new data.
This article describes how to set up continuous export to a Log Analytics workspace or to an event hub in Azure.
Tip
Defender for Cloud also offers the option to do a onetime, manual export to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Learn how todownload a CSV file.

UnderExport target, choose where you'd like the data saved. Data can be saved in a target of a different subscription (for example, in a central Event Hubs instance or in a central Log Analytics workspace).You can also send the data to anevent hub or Log Analytics workspace in a different tenant
