Standard Public Azure Load Balancer frontend IPv4 and IPv6 addresses support testing reachability using ping and traceroute. Testing reachability of a load balancer frontend is useful for troubleshooting inbound connectivity issues to Azure resources. In this article, you learn how to use ping and traceroute for testing a frontend of an existing Standard public load balancer. It can be completed from an Azure Virtual Machine or from a device outside of Azure.

Note
Testing inbound connectivity to Azure Load Balancer frontends is only supported for public load balancers. Testing inbound connectivity to internal load balancer frontends is not supported.
Testing from a device outside of Azure

Test the load balancer's frontend
Choose either ping or traceroute to test reachability of a standard load balancer frontend from a device outside of Azure.
Ping

Traceroute
Traceroute
Follow these steps to test reachability of a standard public load balancer frontend usingpingfrom a Windows device outside of Azure:
ping
From your Windows device, open theSearch taskbarand entercmd. SelectCommand Prompt.
cmd
In the command prompt, type the following command:
ping <Input your load balancer public IP address>
ping <Input your load balancer public IP address>
Review ping's output.
Follow these steps to test reachability of a standard public load balancer frontend usingpingfrom a Linux device outside of Azure:
ping
Open Terminal.
Type the following command:
ping <Input your load balancer public IP address>
ping <Input your load balancer public IP address>
Review ping's output.
Follow these steps to test reachability of a standard public load balancer frontend usingtracertfrom a Windows device outside of Azure:
tracert
From your Windows device, open theSearch taskbarand entercmd. SelectCommand Prompt.
cmd
In the command prompt, type the following command:
tracert <Input your load balancer public IP address>
tracert <Input your load balancer public IP address>
Review tracert's output.
Follow these steps to test reachability of a standard public load balancer frontend usingtraceroutefrom a Linux device outside of Azure:
traceroute
Open Terminal.
Type the following command:
traceroute -I <Input your load balancer public IP address>
traceroute -I <Input your load balancer public IP address>
Review traceroute's output.
Testing from an Azure Virtual Machine
This section describes how to test reachability of a standard public load balancer frontend from an Azure Virtual Machine. First, you create an inbound Network Security Group (NSG) rule on the virtual machine to allow ICMP traffic. Then, you test reachability of the frontend of the load balancer from the virtual machine with ping or traceroute.
Configure inbound NSG rule
Sign in to theâ¯Azure portal.
Sign in to theâ¯Azure portal.
In the Search bar at the top of the portal, enterVirtual machinesand select Virtual machines.

InVirtual machines, select your virtual machine from the list.
In the virtual machineâs menu, selectNetworkingand then selectAdd inbound port rule.
In the virtual machineâs menu, selectNetworkingand then selectAdd inbound port rule.

Expected replies with ping
Based on the current health probe state of your backend instances, you receive different replies when testing the Load Balancerâs frontend with ping. Review the following scenarios for the expected reply:
Usage considerations
ICMP pings can't be disabled and are allowed by default on Standard Public Load Balancers.
ICMP pings with packet sizes larger than 64 bytes will be dropped, leading to timeouts.
Outbound ICMP pings are not supported on a Load Balancer.
Note
ICMP ping requests are not sent to the backend instances; they are handled by the Load Balancer.
