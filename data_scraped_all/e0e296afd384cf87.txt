Management groups are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple
subscriptions. Create these containers to build an effective and efficient hierarchy that can be
used withAzure PolicyandAzure Role Based Access
Controls. For more information on management groups,
seeOrganize your resources with Azure management groups.
The first management group created in the directory could take up to 15 minutes to complete. There
are processes that run the first time to set up the management groups service within Azure for your
directory. You receive a notification when the process is complete. For more information, seeinitial setup of management groups.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afreeaccount before you begin.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afreeaccount before you begin.
Before you start, make sure that the latest version of Azure PowerShell is installed. SeeInstall Azure PowerShell modulefor detailed information.

Any Microsoft Entra ID user in the tenant can create a management group without the management group write
permission assigned to that user ifhierarchy protectionisn't enabled. This new management group becomes a child of the Root Management Group or thedefault management groupand the creator is given an Owner role assignment. Management group service allows this ability
so that role assignments aren't needed at the root level. When the Root
Management Group is created, users don't have access to it. To start using management groups, the service allows the creation of the initial management groups at the root level. For more information, seeRoot management group for each directory.

Azure Cloud Shell
Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.
To start Azure Cloud Shell:

Create in Azure PowerShell
For PowerShell, use theNew-AzManagementGroupcmdlet to create a
new management group. In this example, the management groupGroupNameisContoso.
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso'
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso'
TheGroupNameis a unique identifier being created. This ID is used by other commands to
reference this group and it can't be changed later.
If you want the management group to show a different name within the Azure portal, add theDisplayNameparameter. For example, to create a management group with the GroupName of Contoso
and the display name of "Contoso Group", use the following cmdlet:
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso' -DisplayName 'Contoso Group'
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso' -DisplayName 'Contoso Group'
In the preceding examples, the new management group is created under the root management group. To
specify a different management group as the parent, use theParentIdparameter.
$parentGroup = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupName Contoso
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'ContosoSubGroup' -ParentId $parentGroup.id
$parentGroup = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupName Contoso
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'ContosoSubGroup' -ParentId $parentGroup.id
Clean up resources
To remove the management group created above, use theRemove-AzManagementGroupcmdlet:
Remove-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso'
Remove-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso'
Next steps
In this quickstart, you created a management group to organize your resource hierarchy. The
management group can hold subscriptions or other management groups.
