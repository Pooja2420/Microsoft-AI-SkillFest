Map a custom domain to an Azure Blob Storage endpoint

In this article
You can map a custom domain to a blob service endpoint or astatic websiteendpoint.
Note
This mapping works only for subdomains (for example:www.contoso.com). If you want your web endpoint to be available on the root domain (for example:contoso.com), then you'll have to use Azure CDN. For guidance, see theMap a custom domain with HTTPS enabledsection of this article. Because you're going to that section of this article to enable the root domain of your custom domain, the step within that section for enabling HTTPS is optional.
www.contoso.com
contoso.com

Map a custom domain with only HTTP enabled
This approach is easier, but enables only HTTP access. If the storage account is configured torequire secure transferover HTTPS, then you must enable HTTPS access for your custom domain.
To enable HTTPS access, see theMap a custom domain with HTTPS enabledsection of this article.

Map a custom domain
Important
Your custom domain will be briefly unavailable to users while you complete the configuration. If your domain currently supports an application with a service-level agreement (SLA) that requires zero downtime, then follow the steps in theMap a custom domain with zero downtimesection of this article to ensure that users can access your domain while the DNS mapping takes place.
If you are unconcerned that the domain is briefly unavailable to your users, follow these steps.
âï¸ Step 1: Get the host name of your storage endpoint.
âï¸ Step 2: Create a canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider.
âï¸ Step 3: Register the custom domain with Azure.
âï¸ Step 4: Test your custom domain.

The host name is the storage endpoint URL without the protocol identifier and the trailing slash.
In theAzure portal, go to your storage account.

In the menu pane, underSettings, selectEndpoints.

Copy the value of theBlob serviceendpoint or theStatic websiteendpoint to a text file.NoteThe Data Lake storage endpoint is not supported (For example:https://mystorageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/).

Create a CNAME record to point to your host name. A CNAME record is a type of Domain Name System (DNS) record that maps a source domain name to a destination domain name.

After the CNAME record has propagated through the Domain Name Servers (DNS), and if your users have the appropriate permissions, they can view blob data by using the custom domain.
To confirm that your custom domain is mapped to your blob service endpoint, create a blob in a public container within your storage account. Then, in a web browser, access the blob by using a URI in the following format:http://<subdomain.customdomain>/<mycontainer>/<myblob>
http://<subdomain.customdomain>/<mycontainer>/<myblob>
For example, to access a web form in themyformscontainer in thephotos.contoso.comcustom subdomain, you might use the following URI:http://photos.contoso.com/myforms/applicationform.htm
myforms
http://photos.contoso.com/myforms/applicationform.htm

Map a custom domain with zero downtime
Note
If you are unconcerned that the domain is briefly unavailable to your users, then consider using the steps in theMap a custom domainsection of this article. It's a simpler approach with fewer steps.
If your domain currently supports an application with a service-level agreement (SLA) that requires zero downtime, then follow these steps to ensure that users can access your domain while the DNS mapping takes place.
âï¸ Step 1: Get the host name of your storage endpoint.

âï¸ Step 3: Pre-register the custom domain with Azure.
âï¸ Step 4: Create a CNAME record with your domain provider.
âï¸ Step 5: Test your custom domain.

The host name is the storage endpoint URL without the protocol identifier and the trailing slash.

When you pre-register your custom domain with Azure, you permit Azure to recognize your custom domain without having to modify the DNS record for the domain. That way, when you do modify the DNS record for the domain, it will be mapped to the blob endpoint with no downtime.
