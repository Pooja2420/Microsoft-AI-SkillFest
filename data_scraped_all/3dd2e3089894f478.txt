If your organization is secured with a firewall or proxy server, you must add certain internet protocol (IP) addresses and domain uniform resource locators (URLs) to theallowlist. Adding these IPs and URLs to the allowlist helps to ensure that you have the best experience with Azure DevOps. You know that you need to update your allowlist if you can't access Azure DevOps on your network. See the following sections in this article:
Allowed domain URLs
IP addresses and range restrictions
Tip
So that Visual Studio and Azure Services work well with no network issues, open select ports and protocols. For more information, seeInstall and use Visual Studio behind a firewall or proxy server, Use Visual Studio and Azure Services.

IP addresses and range restrictions
Outbound connections
Outbound connectionstarget other dependent sites. Examples of such connections include:
Browsers connecting to Azure DevOps website as users go to and use features of Azure DevOps
Azure Pipelines agents installed on your organization's network connecting to Azure DevOps to poll for pending jobs
CI events sent from a source code repository hosted within your organization's network to Azure DevOps
Ensure the following IP addresses are allowed for outbound connections, so your organization works with any existing firewall or IP restrictions. The endpoint data in the following chart lists requirements for connectivity from a machine in your organization to Azure DevOps Services.

If you're currently allowing the13.107.6.183and13.107.9.183IP addresses, leave them in place, as you don't need to remove them.
13.107.6.183
13.107.9.183
Note
Azure Service Tagsaren't supported foroutboundconnections.
Inbound connections
Inbound connectionsoriginate from Azure DevOps and target resources within your organization's network. Examples of such connections include:
Azure DevOps Services connecting to endpoints forService Hooks
Azure DevOps Services connecting to customer-controlled SQL Azure VMs forData Import
Azure Pipelines connecting to on-premises source code repositories such asGitHub EnterpriseorBitbucket Server
Azure DevOps ServicesAudit Streamingconnecting to on-premises or cloud-based Splunk
Ensure the following IP addresses are allowed for inbound connections, so your organization works with any existing firewall or IP restrictions. The endpoint data in the following chart lists requirements for connectivity from Azure DevOps Services to your on-premises or other cloud services.
Azure Service Tags are supported only forinboundconnections. Instead of allowing the previously listed IP ranges, you may use theAzureDevOpsservice tag for Azure Firewall and Network Security Group (NSG) or on-premises firewall via a JSON file download.
Note
The Service Tag or previously mentioned inbound IP addresses don't apply to Microsoft Hosted agents. Customers are still required to allow theentire geography for the Microsoft Hosted agents.  If allowing the entire geography is a concern, we recommend using theMicrosoft Managed DevOps Pools. Alternatively, you can also useAzure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents. Managed DevOps Pools and Scale Set agents are a form of self-hosted agents that can be auto-scaled to meet your demands.Hosted macOS agents are hosted in GitHub's macOS cloud. IP ranges can be retrieved using theGitHub metadata APIusing the instructions providedhere.

https://*.visualstudio.com
https://*.dedup.microsoft.com
https://*.blob.core.windows.net
https://*.visualstudio.com

Also allow all IP addresses in the "name": "Storage.{region}" section of the following file (updated weekly):Azure IP ranges and Service Tags - Public Cloud. {region} is the same Azure Geography as your organization.
NuGet connections
Ensure the following domain URLs are allowed for NuGet connections:
https://*.azurewebsites.net
https://*.nuget.org
https://*.azurewebsites.net
https://*.nuget.org
Note
Privately owned NuGet server URLs might not be included in the previous list. You can check the NuGet servers you're using by opening%APPData%\Nuget\NuGet.Config.

If you need to connect to Git repositories on Azure DevOps with SSH, allow requests to port 22 for the following hosts:
ssh.dev.azure.com
vs-ssh.visualstudio.com
ssh.dev.azure.com
vs-ssh.visualstudio.com
Also allow IP addresses in the "name": "AzureDevOps" section ofthis downloadable file(updated weekly) named:Azure IP ranges and Service Tags - Public Cloud
Azure Pipelines Microsoft-hosted agents
If you use Microsoft-hosted agent to run your jobs and you need the information about what IP addresses are used, seeMicrosoft-hosted agents IP ranges. See allMicrosoft Managed DevOps PoolsandAzure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents.
For more information about hosted Windows, Linux, and macOS agents, seeMicrosoft-hosted agent IP ranges.
Azure Pipelines self-hosted agents
If you're running a firewall and your code is in Azure Repos, seeSelf-hosted Linux agents FAQs,Self-hosted macOS agents FAQsorSelf-hosted Windows agents FAQs. This article has information about which domain URLs and IP addresses your private agent needs to communicate with.
Important
Edgio CDN for Azure DevOps is being retired, which requires a new domain URL to be allow-listed in firewall rules for agent software download.
The new domain to allow-list for agent download ishttps://*.dev.azure.com. If your firewall rules don't allow wildcards, usehttps://download.agent.dev.azure.com.
https://*.dev.azure.com
https://download.agent.dev.azure.com
The Azure DevOps team recommends to make this change by the following date:
May 1, 2025 for Azure DevOps Services
May 15, 2025 for Azure DevOps Server
For more information, seeCDN Domain URL change for Agents in Pipelines.
Azure DevOps import service
During the import process, we highly recommend that you restrict access to your virtual machine (VM) to only IP addresses from Azure DevOps. To restrict access, allow only connections from the set of Azure DevOps IP addresses,  which were involved in the collection database import process. For information about identifying the correct IP addresses, see(Optional) Restrict access to Azure DevOps Services IPs only.
Note
Azure DevOps doesn't natively support allowlisting directly within its settings. However, you can manage allowlisting at the network level using your organization's firewall or proxy settings.
