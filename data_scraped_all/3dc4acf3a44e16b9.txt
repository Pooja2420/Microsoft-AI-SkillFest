APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
This quickstart describes the steps for creating a new API Management instance using the Azure portal. After creating an instance, you can use the Azure portal for common management tasks such as importing APIs in your API Management instance.
Azure API Managementhelps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. API Management provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. With API Management, create and manage modern API gateways for existing backend services hosted anywhere.
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.

The name can't be changed later. The service name refers to both the service and the corresponding Azure resource.The service name is used to generate a default domain name:<name>.azure-api.net.If you would like to configure a custom domain name later, seeConfigure a custom domain.Organization nameThe name of your organization. This name is used in many places, including the title of the developer portal and sender of notification emails.Administrator emailThe email address to which all system notifications fromAPI Managementwill be sent.Pricing tierSelect atierwith the features you need.

On theMonitor + securetab, optionally select one or more recommended add-in services to use with API Management. These services incur extra costs. For example, selectLog Analyticsto define a Log Analytics workspace you can target for API Management logs.

On theManaged identitytab, we recommend selecting the checkbox to enable a system-assigned identity for your API Management instance. A managed identity generated by Microsoft Entra ID allows your API Management instance to easily and securely access other Microsoft Entra protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault. Azure manages this identity, so you don't have to provision or rotate any credentials.

Optionally, on theTagstab, add tags to your API Management instance. Tags are key-value pairs that help you organize and manage your Azure resources.
