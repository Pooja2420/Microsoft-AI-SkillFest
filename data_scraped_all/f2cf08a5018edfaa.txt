Azure OpenAI Service lets you tailor our models to your personal datasets by using a process known asfine-tuning. This customization step lets you get more out of the service by providing:
Higher quality results than what you can get just fromprompt engineering
The ability to train on more examples than can fit into a model's max request context limit.
Token savings due to shorter prompts
Lower-latency requests, particularly when using smaller models.
In contrast to few-shot learning, fine tuning improves the model by training on many more examples than can fit in a prompt, letting you achieve better results on a wide number of tasks. Because fine tuning adjusts the base modelâs weights to improve performance on the specific task, you wonât have to include as many examples or instructions in your prompt. This means less text sent and fewer tokens processed on every API call, potentially saving cost, and improving request latency.
We use LoRA, or low rank adaptation, to fine-tune models in a way that reduces their complexity without significantly affecting their performance. This method works by approximating the original high-rank matrix with a lower rank one, thus only fine-tuning a smaller subset ofimportantparameters during the supervised training phase, making the model more manageable and efficient. For users, this makes training faster and more affordable than other techniques.
There are two unique fine-tuning experiences in the Azure AI Foundry portal:
Hub/Project view- supports fine-tuning models from multiple providers including Azure OpenAI, Meta Llama, Microsoft Phi, etc.
Azure OpenAI centric view- only supports fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models, but has support for additional features like theWeights & Biases (W&B) preview integration.
If you are only fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models, we recommend the Azure OpenAI centric fine-tuning experience which is available by navigating tohttps://ai.azure.com/resource/overview.

Optionally,choose your validation data.
Optionally,configure task parametersfor your fine-tuning job.
Review your choices and train your new custom model.
Check the status of your custom fine-tuned model.
Deploy your custom model for use.
Use your custom model.
Optionally, analyze your custom model for performance and fit.
Prepare your training and validation data
Your training data and validation data sets consist of input and output examples for how you would like the model to perform.
The training and validation data you usemustbe formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document and must be formatted in the conversational format that is used by theChat completionsAPI.
It's generally recommended to use the instructions and prompts that you found worked best in every training example. This will help you get the best results, especially if you have fewer than a hundred examples.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Datasets size consideration
The more training examples you have, the better. Fine-tuning jobs will not proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number isn't enough to noticeably influence model responses. It is best practice to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples to be successful. It's recommended to start with 50 well-crafted training data.
In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind, low quality examples can negatively impact performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data, without first pruning the dataset for only the highest quality examples you could end up with a model that performs much worse than expected.
Use the Create custom model wizard
Azure AI Foundry portal provides theCreate custom modelwizard, so you can interactively create and train a fine-tuned model for your Azure resource.
Go to the Azure AI Foundry portal athttps://ai.azure.com/and sign in with credentials that have access to your Azure OpenAI resource. During the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

Note
Training data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Choose your validation data
The next step provides options to configure the model to use validation data in the training process. If you don't want to use validation data, you can chooseNextto continue to the advanced options for the model. Otherwise, if you have a validation dataset, you can either choose existing prepared validation data or upload new prepared validation data to use when customizing your model.

Similar to training data files, validation data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Configure task parameters
TheCreate custom modelwizard shows the parameters for training your fine-tuned model on theTask parameterspane. The following parameters are available:
batch_size
learning_rate_multiplier
n_epochs
seed
Beta

SelectDefaultto use the default values for the fine-tuning job, or selectCustomto display and edit the hyperparameter values. When defaults are selected, we determine the correct value algorithmically based on your training data.
After you configure the advanced options, selectNexttoreview your choices and train your fine-tuned model.
Review your choices and train your model
Review your choices and selectSubmitto start training your new fine-tuned model.
Check the status of your custom model
After you submit your fine-tuning job, you will see a page with details about your fine-tuned model. You can find the status and more information about your fine-tuned model on theFine-tuningpage in Azure AI Foundry portal.
Your job might be queued behind other jobs on the system. Training your model can take minutes or hours depending on the model and dataset size.
Checkpoints
When each training epoch completes a checkpoint is generated. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model which can both be deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, as they may provide snapshots prior to overfitting. When a fine-tuning job completes you will have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy.
Analyze your custom model
Azure OpenAI attaches a result file namedresults.csvto each fine-tuning job after it completes. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your custom model. The file ID for the result file is listed for each custom model in theResult file Idcolumn on theModelspane for Azure AI Foundry portal. You can use the file ID to identify and download the result file from theData filespane of Azure AI Foundry portal.
The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step performed by the fine-tuning job. The result file contains the following columns:
step
train_loss
train_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
valid_loss
validation_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
full_valid_loss
full_valid_mean_token_accuracy
You can also view the data in your results.csv file as plots in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the link for your trained model, and you will see three charts: loss, mean token accuracy, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets will appear on the same plot.
Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If you see a divergence between your training and validation data, that may indicate that you are overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs, or a smaller learning rate multiplier.
Deploy a fine-tuned model
When the fine-tuning job succeeds, you can deploy the custom model from theModelspane. You must deploy your custom model to make it available for use with completion calls.
Important
After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for greater than fifteen (15) days,
the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model isinactiveif the model was deployed more than fifteen (15) days ago
and no completions or chat completions calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.
The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model,
and the customized model can be redeployed at any time.
As described inAzure OpenAI Service pricing,
each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether completions
or chat completions calls are being made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI,
refer to the guidance inPlan to manage costs for Azure OpenAI Service.
To deploy your custom model, select the custom model to deploy, and then selectDeploy.
TheDeploy modeldialog box opens. In the dialog box, enter yourDeployment nameand then selectCreateto start the deployment of your custom model.
You can monitor the progress of your deployment on theDeploymentspane in Azure AI Foundry portal.
Use a deployed fine-tuned model
After your fine-tuned model deploys, you can use it like any other deployed model. You can use thePlaygroundinAzure AI Foundryto experiment with your new deployment. You can also use the REST API to call your fine-tuned model from your own application. You can even begin to use this new fine-tuned model in your prompt flow to build your generative AI application.
Note
For chat models, thesystem message that you use to guide your fine-tuned model(whether it's deployed or available for testing in the playground) must be the same as the system message you used for training. If you use a different system message, the model might not perform as expected.
Continuous fine-tuning
Once you have created a fine-tuned model you may wish to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples.
To perform fine-tuning on a model that you have previously fine-tuned you would use the same process as described increate a customized modelbut instead of specifying the name of a generic base model you would specify your already fine-tuned model. A custom fine-tuned model would look likegpt-35-turbo-0125.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7
gpt-35-turbo-0125.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7

We also recommend including thesuffixparameter to make it easier to distinguish between different iterations of your fine-tuned model.suffixtakes a string, and is set to identify the fine-tuned model. With the OpenAI Python API a string of up to 18 characters is supported that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.

Clean up your deployments, custom models, and training files
When you're done with your custom model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files you uploaded to the service, if needed.
Delete your model deployment
Important
After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for greater than fifteen (15) days,
the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model isinactiveif the model was deployed more than fifteen (15) days ago
and no completions or chat completions calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.
The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model,
and the customized model can be redeployed at any time.
As described inAzure OpenAI Service pricing,
each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether completions
or chat completions calls are being made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI,
refer to the guidance inPlan to manage costs for Azure OpenAI Service.
You can delete the deployment for your custom model on theDeploymentspane in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the deployment to delete, and then selectDeleteto delete the deployment.
Delete your custom model
You can delete a custom model on theModelspane in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the custom model to delete from theCustomized modelstab, and then selectDeleteto delete the custom model.
Note
You can't delete a custom model if it has an existing deployment. You must firstdelete your model deploymentbefore you can delete your custom model.
Delete your training files
You can optionally delete training and validation files that you uploaded for training, and result files generated during training, on theManagement>Data + indexespane in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the file to delete, and then selectDeleteto delete the file.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Datasets size consideration
The more training examples you have, the better. Fine tuning jobs will not proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number isn't enough to noticeably influence model responses. It is best practice to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples to be successful. It's recommended to start with 50 well-crafted training data.
In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind, low quality examples can negatively impact performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data, without first pruning the dataset for only the highest quality examples you could end up with a model that performs much worse than expected.
Create your fine-tuned model

Then selectNext.
Then selectNext.

Choose your training data
The next step is to either choose existing prepared training data or upload new prepared training data to use when customizing your model. TheTraining datapane displays any existing, previously uploaded datasets and also provides options to upload new training data.

If your training data is already in your project, selectData in Azure AI Foundry.Select the file from the list shown in theTraining datapane.

If your training data is already uploaded to the Azure OpenAI service, select your Azure OpenAI connection underConnected AI resource.
To upload training data to fine-tune your model, selectUpload dataand then selectUpload file.Make sure all your training examples follow the expected format for inference. To fine-tune models effectively, ensure a balanced and diverse dataset. This involves maintaining data balance, including various scenarios, and periodically refining training data to align with real-world expectations, ultimately leading to more accurate and balanced model responses. Seedata preparationfor more information.For large data files, we recommend that you import from an Azure Blob store. Large files can become unstable when uploaded through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed. For more information about Azure Blob Storage, seeWhat is Azure Blob Storage?

Note
Training data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
After uploading files, you will see a preview of your training data. SelectNextto continue.

Choose your validation data
Optionally, you can choose to provide validation data to fine-tune your model. If you don't want to use validation data, you can selectNoneand selectNextto continue to the advanced options for the model.
Otherwise, if you have a validation dataset, you can either choose from previously uploaded data or upload newly prepared validation data to use for fine-tuning your model.
Note
Similar to training data files, validation data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Configure your parameters
Optionally, configure parameters for your fine-tuning job. The following are available:
batch_size
learning_rate_multiplier
n_epochs
seed
Beta
You can choose to leave the default configuration or customize the values to your preference. After you finish making your configurations, selectNext.
Review your choices and train your model
Review your choices and selectSubmitto start training your new fine-tuned model.
Check the status of your fine-tuned model
After you submit your fine-tuning job, you see a page with details about your fine-tuned model. You can find the status and more information about your fine-tuned model on theFine-tuningpage in Azure AI Foundry portal.
Your job might be queued behind other jobs on the system. Training your model can take minutes or hours depending on the model and dataset size.
Checkpoints
When each training epoch completes a checkpoint is generated. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model which can both be deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, as they may provide snapshots prior to overfitting. When a fine-tuning job completes you will have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy.

Analyze your fine-tuned model
After fine-tuning is successfully completed, you can download a result file namedresults.csvfrom the fine-tuned model page under theDetailstab. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your custom model.
The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step performed by the fine-tuning job. The result file contains the following columns:
step
train_loss
train_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
valid_loss
validation_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
full_valid_loss
full_valid_mean_token_accuracy
You can also view the data in your results.csv file as plots in Azure AI Foundry portal under theMetricstab of your fine-tuned model. Select the link for your trained model, and you will see two charts: loss, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets will appear on the same plot.

Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If you see a divergence between your training and validation data that may indicate that you are overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs, or a smaller learning rate multiplier.
Deploy a fine-tuned model
Once your model is fine-tuned, you can deploy the model and can use it in your own application.
When you deploy the model, you make the model available for inferencing, and that incurs an hourly hosting charge. Fine-tuned models, however, can be stored in Azure AI Foundry portal at no cost until you're ready to use them.
Important
After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for greater than fifteen (15) days,
the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model isinactiveif the model was deployed more than fifteen (15) days ago
and no completions or chat completions calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.
The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model,
and the customized model can be redeployed at any time.
As described inAzure OpenAI Service pricing,
each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether completions
or chat completions calls are being made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI,
refer to the guidance inPlan to manage costs for Azure OpenAI Service.
You can monitor the progress of your deployment on theDeploymentspage in Azure AI Foundry portal.
Use a deployed fine-tuned model
After your fine-tuned model deploys, you can use it like any other deployed model. You can use thePlaygroundinAzure AI Foundryto experiment with your new deployment. You can also use the REST API to call your fine-tuned model from your own application. You can even begin to use this new fine-tuned model in your prompt flow to build your generative AI application.
Note
For chat models, thesystem message that you use to guide your fine-tuned model(whether it's deployed or available for testing in the playground) must be the same as the system message you used for training. If you use a different system message, the model might not perform as expected.
Clean up your deployments, fine-tuned models, and training files
When you're done with your fine-tuned model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files you uploaded to the service, if needed.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Create your training and validation datasets
The more training examples you have, the better. Fine tuning jobs will not proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number is not enough to noticeably influence model responses. It is best practice to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples to be successful.
In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind, low quality examples can negatively impact performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data, without first pruning the dataset for only the highest quality examples you could end up with a model that performs much worse than expected.
Upload your training data
The next step is to either choose existing prepared training data or upload new prepared training data to use when customizing your model. After you prepare your training data, you can upload your files to the service. There are two ways to upload training data:
From a local file
Import from an Azure Blob store or other web location
For large data files, we recommend that you import from an Azure Blob  store. Large files can become unstable when uploaded through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed. For more information about Azure Blob storage, seeWhat is Azure Blob storage?
Note
Training data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
The following Python example uploads local training and validation files by using the Python SDK, and retrieves the returned file IDs.
# Upload fine-tuning files

import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version="2024-10-21"  # This API version or later is required to access seed/events/checkpoint capabilities
)

training_file_name = 'training_set.jsonl'
validation_file_name = 'validation_set.jsonl'

# Upload the training and validation dataset files to Azure OpenAI with the SDK.

training_response = client.files.create(
    file=open(training_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune"
)
training_file_id = training_response.id

validation_response = client.files.create(
    file=open(validation_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune"
)
validation_file_id = validation_response.id

print("Training file ID:", training_file_id)
print("Validation file ID:", validation_file_id)
# Upload fine-tuning files

import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version="2024-10-21"  # This API version or later is required to access seed/events/checkpoint capabilities
)

training_file_name = 'training_set.jsonl'
validation_file_name = 'validation_set.jsonl'

# Upload the training and validation dataset files to Azure OpenAI with the SDK.

training_response = client.files.create(
    file=open(training_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune"
)
training_file_id = training_response.id

validation_response = client.files.create(
    file=open(validation_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune"
)
validation_file_id = validation_response.id

print("Training file ID:", training_file_id)
print("Validation file ID:", validation_file_id)
Create a customized model
After you upload your training and validation files, you're ready to start the fine-tuning job.
The following Python code shows an example of how to create a new fine-tune job with the Python SDK:
In this example we are also passing the seed parameter. The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but may differ in rare cases. If a seed isn't specified, one will be generated for you.
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file=training_file_id,
    validation_file=validation_file_id,
    model="gpt-35-turbo-0125", # Enter base model name. Note that in Azure OpenAI the model name contains dashes and cannot contain dot/period characters. 
    seed = 105  # seed parameter controls reproducibility of the fine-tuning job. If no seed is specified one will be generated automatically.
)

job_id = response.id

# You can use the job ID to monitor the status of the fine-tuning job.
# The fine-tuning job will take some time to start and complete.

print("Job ID:", response.id)
print("Status:", response.id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file=training_file_id,
    validation_file=validation_file_id,
    model="gpt-35-turbo-0125", # Enter base model name. Note that in Azure OpenAI the model name contains dashes and cannot contain dot/period characters. 
    seed = 105  # seed parameter controls reproducibility of the fine-tuning job. If no seed is specified one will be generated automatically.
)

job_id = response.id

# You can use the job ID to monitor the status of the fine-tuning job.
# The fine-tuning job will take some time to start and complete.

print("Job ID:", response.id)
print("Status:", response.id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
You can also pass additional optional parameters like hyperparameters to take greater control of the fine-tuning process. For initial training we recommend using the automatic defaults that are present without specifying these parameters.
The current supported hyperparameters for fine-tuning are:
batch_size
learning_rate_multiplier
n_epochs
seed
To set custom hyperparameters with the 1.x version of the OpenAI Python API:
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version="2024-10-21"  # This API version or later is required
)

client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
  training_file="file-abc123", 
  model="gpt-35-turbo-0125", # Enter base model name. Note that in Azure OpenAI the model name contains dashes and cannot contain dot/period characters. 
  hyperparameters={
    "n_epochs":2
  }
)
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version="2024-10-21"  # This API version or later is required
)

client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
  training_file="file-abc123", 
  model="gpt-35-turbo-0125", # Enter base model name. Note that in Azure OpenAI the model name contains dashes and cannot contain dot/period characters. 
  hyperparameters={
    "n_epochs":2
  }
)
Check fine-tuning job status
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id)

print("Job ID:", response.id)
print("Status:", response.status)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id)

print("Job ID:", response.id)
print("Status:", response.status)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
List fine-tuning events
To examine the individual fine-tuning events that were generated during training, you might need to upgrade your OpenAI client library to the latest version withpip install openai --upgradeto run this command.
pip install openai --upgrade
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(fine_tuning_job_id=job_id, limit=10)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(fine_tuning_job_id=job_id, limit=10)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
Checkpoints
When each training epoch completes a checkpoint is generated. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model which can both be deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, as they may provide snapshots prior to overfitting. When a fine-tuning job completes you will have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy. The final epoch will be represented by your fine-tuned model, the previous two epochs will be available as checkpoints.
You can run the list checkpoints command to retrieve the list of checkpoints associated with an individual fine-tuning job. You might need to upgrade your OpenAI client library to the latest version withpip install openai --upgradeto run this command.
pip install openai --upgrade
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.checkpoints.list(job_id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.checkpoints.list(job_id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
Analyze your customized model
Azure OpenAI attaches a result file namedresults.csvto each fine-tune job after it completes. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your customized model. The file ID for the result file is listed for each customized model, and you can use the Python SDK to retrieve the file ID and download the result file for analysis.
The following Python example retrieves the file ID of the first result file attached to the fine-tuning job for your customized model, and then uses the Python SDK to download the file to your working directory for analysis.
# Retrieve the file ID of the first result file from the fine-tuning job
# for the customized model.
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id)
if response.status == 'succeeded':
    result_file_id = response.result_files[0]

retrieve = client.files.retrieve(result_file_id)

# Download the result file.
print(f'Downloading result file: {result_file_id}')

with open(retrieve.filename, "wb") as file:
    result = client.files.content(result_file_id).read()
    file.write(result)
# Retrieve the file ID of the first result file from the fine-tuning job
# for the customized model.
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id)
if response.status == 'succeeded':
    result_file_id = response.result_files[0]

retrieve = client.files.retrieve(result_file_id)

# Download the result file.
print(f'Downloading result file: {result_file_id}')

with open(retrieve.filename, "wb") as file:
    result = client.files.content(result_file_id).read()
    file.write(result)
The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step performed by the fine-tuning job. The result file contains the following columns:
step
train_loss
train_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
valid_loss
validation_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
full_valid_loss
full_valid_mean_token_accuracy
You can also view the data in your results.csv file as plots in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the link for your trained model, and you will see three charts: loss, mean token accuracy, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets will appear on the same plot.
Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If you see a divergence between your training and validation data that can indicate that you are overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs, or a smaller learning rate multiplier.
Deploy a fine-tuned model
When the fine-tuning job succeeds, the value of thefine_tuned_modelvariable in the response body is set to the name of your customized model. Your model is now also available for discovery from thelist Models API. However, you can't issue completion calls to your customized model until your customized model is deployed. You must deploy your customized model to make it available for use with completion calls.
fine_tuned_model
Unlike the previous SDK commands, deployment must be done using the control plane API which requires separate authorization, a different API path, and a different API version.

Continuous fine-tuning
Once you have created a fine-tuned model you might want to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples.
To perform fine-tuning on a model that you have previously fine-tuned you would use the same process as described increate a customized modelbut instead of specifying the name of a generic base model you would specify your already fine-tuned model's ID. The fine-tuned model ID looks likegpt-35-turbo-0125.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7

We also recommend including thesuffixparameter to make it easier to distinguish between different iterations of your fine-tuned model.suffixtakes a string, and is set to identify the fine-tuned model. With the OpenAI Python API a string of up to 18 characters is supported that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.

If you are unsure of the ID of your existing fine-tuned model this information can be found in theModelspage of Azure AI Foundry, or you can generate alist of modelsfor a given Azure OpenAI resource using the REST API.
Clean up your deployments, customized models, and training files
When you're done with your customized model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files you uploaded to the service, if needed.
Delete your model deployment
Important
After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for greater than fifteen (15) days,
the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model isinactiveif the model was deployed more than fifteen (15) days ago
and no completions or chat completions calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.
The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model,
and the customized model can be redeployed at any time.
As described inAzure OpenAI Service pricing,
each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether completions
or chat completions calls are being made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI,
refer to the guidance inPlan to manage costs for Azure OpenAI Service.
You can use various methods to delete the deployment for your customized model:
Azure AI Foundry
TheAzure CLI
Delete your customized model
Similarly, you can use various methods to delete your customized model:
Azure AI Foundry
Note
You can't delete a customized model if it has an existing deployment. You must firstdelete your model deploymentbefore you can delete your customized model.
Delete your training files
You can optionally delete training and validation files that you uploaded for training, and result files generated during training, from your Azure OpenAI subscription. You can use the following methods to delete your training, validation, and result files:
Azure AI Foundry
TheREST APIs
The Python SDK
The following Python example uses the Python SDK to delete the training, validation, and result files for your customized model:
print('Checking for existing uploaded files.')
results = []

# Get the complete list of uploaded files in our subscription.
files = openai.File.list().data
print(f'Found {len(files)} total uploaded files in the subscription.')

# Enumerate all uploaded files, extracting the file IDs for the
# files with file names that match your training dataset file and
# validation dataset file names.
for item in files:
    if item["filename"] in [training_file_name, validation_file_name, result_file_name]:
        results.append(item["id"])
print(f'Found {len(results)} already uploaded files that match our files')

# Enumerate the file IDs for our files and delete each file.
print(f'Deleting already uploaded files.')
for id in results:
    openai.File.delete(sid = id)
print('Checking for existing uploaded files.')
results = []

# Get the complete list of uploaded files in our subscription.
files = openai.File.list().data
print(f'Found {len(files)} total uploaded files in the subscription.')

# Enumerate all uploaded files, extracting the file IDs for the
# files with file names that match your training dataset file and
# validation dataset file names.
for item in files:
    if item["filename"] in [training_file_name, validation_file_name, result_file_name]:
        results.append(item["id"])
print(f'Found {len(results)} already uploaded files that match our files')

# Enumerate the file IDs for our files and delete each file.
print(f'Deleting already uploaded files.')
for id in results:
    openai.File.delete(sid = id)

Review the workflow for the REST API
Take a moment to review the fine-tuning workflow for using the REST APIS and Python with Azure OpenAI:
Prepare your training and validation data.
Select a base model.
Upload your training data.
Train your new customized model.
Check the status of your customized model.
Deploy your customized model for use.
Use your customized model.
Optionally, analyze your customized model for performance and fit.
Prepare your training and validation data
Your training data and validation data sets consist of input and output examples for how you would like the model to perform.
The training and validation data you usemustbe formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document and must be formatted in the conversational format that is used by theChat completionsAPI.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.
Create your training and validation datasets
The more training examples you have, the better. Fine tuning jobs will not proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number is not enough to noticeably influence model responses. It is best practice to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples to be successful.
In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind, low quality examples can negatively impact performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data without first pruning the dataset for only the highest quality examples, you could end up with a model that performs much worse than expected.
Upload your training data
The next step is to either choose existing prepared training data or upload new prepared training data to use when fine-tuning your model. After you prepare your training data, you can upload your files to the service. There are two ways to upload training data:
For large data files, we recommend that you import from an Azure Blob store. Large files can become unstable when uploaded through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed. For more information about Azure Blob storage, seeWhat is Azure Blob storage?
Note
Training data files must be formatted as JSONL files, encoded in UTF-8 with a byte-order mark (BOM). The file must be less than 512 MB in size.

  -F "file=@C:\\fine-tuning\\validation_set.jsonl;type=application/json"
Create a customized model
After you uploaded your training and validation files, you're ready to start the fine-tuning job. The following code shows an example of how tocreate a new fine-tuning jobwith the REST API.
In this example we are also passing the seed parameter. The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but can differ in rare cases. If a seed is not specified, one will be generated for you.
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-35-turbo-0125", 
    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>", 
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "seed": 105
}'
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-35-turbo-0125", 
    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>", 
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "seed": 105
}'
You can also pass additional optional parameters likehyperparametersto take greater control of the fine-tuning process. For initial training we recommend using the automatic defaults that are present without specifying these parameters.
The current supported hyperparameters for fine-tuning are:
batch_size
learning_rate_multiplier
n_epochs
seed
Check the status of your customized model
After you start a fine-tune job, it can take some time to complete. Your job might be queued behind other jobs in the system. Training your model can take minutes or hours depending on the model and dataset size. The following example uses the REST API to check the status of your fine-tuning job. The example retrieves information about your job by using the job ID returned from the previous example:
curl -X GET $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/<YOUR-JOB-ID>?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
curl -X GET $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/<YOUR-JOB-ID>?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
List fine-tuning events
To examine the individual fine-tuning events that were generated during training:
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/events?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/events?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
Checkpoints
When each training epoch completes a checkpoint is generated. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model which can both be deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, as they may provide snapshots prior to overfitting. When a fine-tuning job completes you will have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy. The final epoch will be represented by your fine-tuned model, the previous two epochs will be available as checkpoints.
You can run the list checkpoints command to retrieve the list of checkpoints associated with an individual fine-tuning job:
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/checkpoints?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/checkpoints?api-version=2024-10-21 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
Analyze your customized model
Azure OpenAI attaches a result file namedresults.csvto each fine-tune job after it completes. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your customized model. The file ID for the result file is listed for each customized model, and you can use the REST API to retrieve the file ID and download the result file for analysis.
The following Python example uses the REST API to retrieve the file ID of the first result file attached to the fine-tuning job for your customized model, and then downloads the file to your working directory for analysis.
curl -X GET "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/<JOB_ID>?api-version=2023-12-01-preview" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
curl -X GET "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs/<JOB_ID>?api-version=2023-12-01-preview" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
curl -X GET "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/files/<RESULT_FILE_ID>/content?api-version=2023-12-01-preview" \
    -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" > <RESULT_FILENAME>
curl -X GET "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/files/<RESULT_FILE_ID>/content?api-version=2023-12-01-preview" \
    -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" > <RESULT_FILENAME>
The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step performed by the fine-tuning job. The result file contains the following columns:
step
train_loss
train_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
valid_loss
validation_mean_token_accuracy
[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]
full_valid_loss
full_valid_mean_token_accuracy
You can also view the data in your results.csv file as plots in Azure AI Foundry portal. Select the link for your trained model, and you will see three charts: loss, mean token accuracy, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets will appear on the same plot.
Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If you see a divergence between your training and validation data that may indicate that you are overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs, or a smaller learning rate multiplier.
Deploy a fine-tuned model
Important
After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for greater than fifteen (15) days,
the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model isinactiveif the model was deployed more than fifteen (15) days ago
and no completions or chat completions calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.
The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model,
and the customized model can be redeployed at any time.
As described inAzure OpenAI Service pricing,
each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether completions
or chat completions calls are being made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI,
refer to the guidance inPlan to manage costs for Azure OpenAI Service.
The following example shows how to use the REST API to create a model deployment for your customized model. The REST API generates a name for the deployment of your customized model.

Continuous fine-tuning
Once you have created a fine-tuned model, you might want to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples.
To perform fine-tuning on a model that you have previously fine-tuned, you would use the same process as described increate a customized modelbut instead of specifying the name of a generic base model you would specify your already fine-tuned model's ID. The fine-tuned model ID looks likegpt-35-turbo-0125.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7
gpt-35-turbo-0125.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7

  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-35-turbo-0125.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7", 
    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>", 
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "suffix": "<additional text used to help identify fine-tuned models>"
}'
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs?api-version=2023-12-01-preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>", 
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "suffix": "<additional text used to help identify fine-tuned models>"
}'
We also recommend including thesuffixparameter to make it easier to distinguish between different iterations of your fine-tuned model.suffixtakes a string, and is set to identify the fine-tuned model. The suffix can contain up to 40 characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9,- and _) that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.
