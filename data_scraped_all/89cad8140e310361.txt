In this article
To start using the Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere features, you need to connect your VMware vCenter Server instance to Azure Arc. This quickstart shows you how to connect your VMware vCenter Server instance to Azure Arc by using a helper script.
First, the script deploys a virtual appliance calledAzure Arc resource bridgein your vCenter environment. Then, it installs a VMware cluster extension to provide a continuous connection between vCenter Server and Azure Arc.
Important
This article describes a way to connect a generic vCenter Server to Azure Arc. If you're trying to enable Arc for Azure VMware Solution (AVS) private cloud, follow this guide instead -Deploy Arc-enabled VMware vSphere for Azure VMware Solution private cloud. With the Arc for AVS onboarding process you need to provide fewer inputs and Arc capabilities are better integrated into the AVS private cloud portal experience.
Prerequisites
Azure
An Azure subscription.

Azure Arc Resource Bridge

vCenter Server
vCenter Server version 7 or 8.
vCenter Server version 7 or 8.
A virtual network that can provide internet access, directly or through a proxy. It must also be possible for VMs on this network to communicate with the vCenter server on TCP port (usually 443).

At least three free static IP addresses on the above network.

A resource pool or a cluster with a minimum capacity of 8 GB of RAM and 4 vCPUs.
A datastore with a minimum of 200 GB of free disk space or 400 GB for High Availability deployment, available through the resource pool or cluster.
A datastore with a minimum of 200 GB of free disk space or 400 GB for High Availability deployment, available through the resource pool or cluster.
Note
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere supports vCenter Server instances with a maximum of 9,500 virtual machines (VMs). If your vCenter Server instance has more than 9,500 VMs, we don't recommend that you use Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere with it at this point.
vSphere account
You need a vSphere account that can:
Read all inventory.
Deploy and update VMs to all the resource pools (or clusters), networks, and VM templates that you want to use with Azure Arc.
Important
As part of the Azure Arc-enabled VMware onboarding script, you will be prompted to provide a vSphere account to deploy the Azure Arc resource bridge VM on the ESXi host. This account will be stored locally within the Azure Arc resource bridge VM and encrypted as a Kubernetes secret at rest. The vSphere account allows Azure Arc-enabled VMware to interact with VMware vSphere. If your organization practices routine credential rotation, you mustupdate the credentials in Azure Arc-enabled VMwareto maintain the connection between Azure Arc-enabled VMware and VMware vSphere.
Workstation
You need a Windows or Linux machine that can access both your vCenter Server instance and the internet, directly or through a proxy. The workstation must also have outbound network connectivity to the ESXi host backing the datastore. Datastore connectivity is needed for uploading the Arc resource bridge image to the datastore as part of the onboarding.
Prepare vCenter Server
Create a resource pool with a reservation of at least 16 GB of RAM and four vCPUs. It should also have access to a datastore with at least 100 GB of free disk space.

Run the script
Use the following instructions to run the script, depending on which operating system your machine is using.
Windows
Open a PowerShell window as an Administrator and go to the folder where you've downloaded the PowerShell script.NoteOn Windows workstations, the script must be run in PowerShell window and not in PowerShell Integrated Script Editor (ISE) as PowerShell ISE doesn't display the input prompts from Azure CLI commands. If the script is run on PowerShell ISE, it could appear as though the script is stuck while it is waiting for input.

Run the following command to allow the script to run, because it's an unsigned script. (If you close the session before you complete all the steps, run this command again for the new session.)Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Run the script by using the following command:

Inputs for the script
A typical onboarding that uses the script takes 30 to 60 minutes. During the process, you're prompted for the following details:
After the command finishes running, your setup is complete. You can now use the capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere.
Important
After the successful installation of Azure Arc Resource Bridge, it's recommended to retain a copy of the resource bridge config.yaml files in a place that facilitates easy retrieval. These files could be needed later to run commands to perform management operations (e.g.az arcappliance upgrade) on the resource bridge. You can find the three .yaml files (config files) in the same folder where you ran the script.
Recovering from failed deployments
If the Azure Arc resource bridge deployment fails, consult theAzure Arc resource bridge troubleshooting document. While there can be many reasons why the Azure Arc resource bridge deployment fails, one of them is KVA timeout error. For more information about the KVA timeout error and how to troubleshoot it, seeKVA timeout error.
To clean up the installation and retry the deployment, use the following commands.
Retry command - Windows
Run the command with-Forceto clean up the installation and onboard again.
-Force
./resource-bridge-onboarding-script.ps1 -Force
./resource-bridge-onboarding-script.ps1 -Force
Retry command - Linux
Run the command with--forceto clean up the installation and onboard again.
--force
bash resource-bridge-onboarding-script.sh --force
bash resource-bridge-onboarding-script.sh --force
