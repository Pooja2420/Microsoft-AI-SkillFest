An ongoing replication (withcross-zoneorcross-region replication) between the source and the destination volumes prepares you for a disaster recovery event.
When such an event occurs, you canfail over to the destination volume, enabling the client to read and write to the destination volume.
After disaster recovery, you can perform aresyncoperation to fail back to the source volume. You thenreestablish the source-to-destination replicationand remount the source volume for the client to access.
Note
When performing a disaster recovery test in Azure NetApp Files, you have tomanually delete the common snapshotafter completing the test.
Fail over to destination volume
Failover is a manual process. When you need to activate the destination volume (for example, when you want to fail over to the destination region), you need to break replication peering then mount the destination volume.
To break replication peering, select the destination volume. SelectReplicationunder Storage Service.

Resync volumes after disaster recovery
After disaster recovery, you can reactivate the source volume by performing a reverse resync operation.  The reverse resync operation reverses the replication process and synchronizes data from the destination volume to the source volume.
Important
The reverse resync operation synchronizes the source and destination volumes by incrementally updating the source volume with the latest updates from the destination volume, based on the last available common snapshots. This operation avoids the need to synchronize the entire volume in most cases because only changes to the destination volumeafterthe most recent common snapshot will have to be replicated to the source volume.
The reverse resync operation overwrites any newer data (than the most common snapshot) in the source volume with the updated destination volume data. The UI warns you about the potential for data loss. You will be prompted to confirm the resync action before the operation starts.
In case the source volume did not survive the disaster and therefore no common snapshot exists, all data in the destination will be resynchronized to a newly created source volume.

Reestablish source-to-destination replication
After the resync operation from destination to source is complete, you need to break replication peering again to reestablish source-to-destination replication. You should also remount the source volume so that the client can access it.
