Migrate AIX workloads to Azure with Skytap
Skytap on Azure simplifies cloud migration for applications that run on IBM Power Systems. This example illustrates a migration of AIX logical partitions (LPARs) to Skytap on Azure and is based on best practices from recent customer experiences. A web app on Microsoft Azure gives users a modern interface for the resources running in LPARs on Skytap on Azure.

Workflow
The numbers in the diagram correspond to the following data flow.
A user on-premises uses a web browser to connect to Azure throughAzure ExpressRoute, which creates a private connection. This web-based app provides a modern interface for the services that run on the AIX LPARs in Skytap on Azure.

Azure Data Box Gateway is deployed on-premises next to the datacenter's existing AIX infrastructure, which includes an AIX Network Installation Management (NIM) server. Data Box Gateway loads the data and completes the system restoration on Azure. AIX backups run using the operating system's nativemksybandsavevgcommands.

The AIX LPAR is rebooted. Any data volume groups are restored through the Data Box Gateway via the Network File System (NFS) protocol. This process is repeated for each LPAR to be restored.

Alternatives
For access to the AIX instances running in Skytap on Azure, you can connect over a virtual private network (VPN) or the internet. For example, you can use SSH (Secure Shell) to access your AIX systems on Azure.

To maximize security and minimize the number of open ports, you can use VMs as bastion hosts for administrative access to the LPARs. The bastion host runs within the VNet on Azure.

Scenario details
Since its introduction in 1986, the AIX operating system has been a top choice for large, mission-critical applications. AIX was designed for virtualization from the ground up using multiple LPARs that run in isolation on a given IBM Power System server. Until now, your choice was to rearchitect applications to move them to the cloud or bear the expense of maintaining them on-premises or in a co-located facility.
Skytap on Azure is dedicated hardware that provides a native IBM Power9 infrastructure with the AIX operating system. Full, cloud-based backup and recovery are provided with Azure Storage. You don't need to refactor or rearchitect applications to run them in Skytap on Azure, and the way you manage existing IBM Power applications on-premises changes very little.
After migration, you can start taking advantage of native Azure services to modernize applications, if desired, or continue to run systems on AIX. Either way, you immediately gain the resilience, flexibility, high availability, and scalability of Azure.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Skytap on Azure has high reliability built on IBM Power9 Systems backed by SSD RAID 6+1 storage and 10 Gb/sec backplane networking.
Skytap on Azure is supported by a service-level agreement (SLA) of 99.95 percent availability.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
Skytap on Azure meets industry cloud security requirements, including System and Organization Controls for Service Organizations 2 (SOC 2) and SOC 3 attestations and compliance with ISO 27001 and PCI DSS 3.2.

Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
Running your AIX-based workloads in Skytap on Azure helps optimize costs compared to on-premises deployments. The consumption-based usage plans let you deploy AIX LPARs only as needed and scale them on demand to meet the needs of your workloads.
See more pricing information on thePlans + Pricingtab of Skytap on Azure in Azure Marketplace.
Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
Skytap on Azure provides high performance and efficiency that support demanding workloads up to 16 vCPUs and 512 GB of memory, while providing the benefits of cloud scale. With capacity on demand and pay-as-you-go pricing, you save the expense of adding hardware on premises to support higher demands. You can use smaller LPARs instead of a few large ones and configure resources as needed.
Skytap on Azure promotes operational excellence through its native support for AIX on IBM Power9 systems that are hosted within Azure datacenters and managed by Microsoft.
One of the advantages of an Azureâbased solution is the ability to scale out. Scaling makes nearly limitless compute capacity available to an application. Azure supports multiple methods to scale out compute power, such asvirtual machine scale setsandload balancingacross a cluster. Other platform as a service (PaaS) options scale compute resources dynamically. In addition, applications on Azure can also useKubernetes clustersas compute services for specified resources.
To scale up on Azure, choose alarger VM sizefor your workload.
