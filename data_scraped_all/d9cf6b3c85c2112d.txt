Automatic device management in Azure IoT Hub automates many of the repetitive and complex tasks of managing large device fleets. With automatic device management, you can target a set of devices based on their properties, define a desired configuration, and then let IoT Hub update the devices when they come into scope. This update is done using anautomatic device configurationorautomatic module configuration, which lets you summarize completion and compliance, handle merging and conflicts, and roll out configurations in a phased approach.
Note
The features described in this article are available only in the standard tier of IoT Hub. For more information about the basic and standard/free IoT Hub tiers, seeChoose the right IoT Hub tier and size for your solution.
Automatic device management works by updating a set of device twins or module twins with desired properties and reporting a summary that's based on twin reported properties.  It introduces a new class and JSON document called aConfigurationthat has three parts:
Thetarget conditiondefines the scope of device twins or module twins to be updated. The target condition is specified as a query on twin tags and/or reported properties.

Thetarget contentdefines the desired properties to be added or updated in the targeted device twins or module twins. The content includes a path to the section of desired properties to be changed.

Themetricsdefine the summary counts of various configuration states such asSuccess,In Progress, andError. Custom metrics are specified as queries on twin reported properties.  System metrics are the default metrics that measure twin update status, such as the number of twins that are targeted and the number of twins that have been successfully updated.

System metrics are the default metrics that measure twin update status, such as the number of twins that are targeted and the number of twins that have been successfully updated.
Automatic configurations run for the first time shortly after the configuration is created and then at five minute intervals. Metrics queries run each time the automatic configuration runs. A maximum of 100 automatic configurations is supported on standard tier IoT hubs; ten on free tier IoT hubs. Throttling limits also apply. To learn more, seeQuotas and Throttling.
Implement twins
Automatic device configurations require the use of device twins to synchronize state between the cloud and devices.  For more information, seeUnderstand and use device twins in IoT Hub.
Automatic module configurations require the use of module twins to synchronize state between the cloud and modules. For more information, seeUnderstand and use module twins in IoT Hub.
Use tags to target twins
Before you create a configuration, you must specify which devices or modules you want to affect. Azure IoT Hub identifies devices using tags in the device twin, and identifies modules using tags in the module twin. Each device or modules can have multiple tags, and you can define them any way that makes sense for your solution. For example, if you manage devices in different locations, add the following tags to a device twin:
"tags": {
	"location": {
		"state": "Washington",
		"city": "Tacoma"
    }
},
"tags": {
	"location": {
		"state": "Washington",
		"city": "Tacoma"
    }
},
Create a configuration
You can create a maximum of 100 automatic configurations on standard tier IoT hubs; ten on free tier IoT hubs. To learn more, seeQuotas and Throttling.
In theAzure portal, go to your IoT hub.

There are five steps to create a configuration. The following sections walk through each one.
Name and label
Give your configuration a unique name that is up to 128 characters long. Lowercase letters and the following special characters are allowed:-+%_*!'. Spaces are not allowed.

Twin settings
This section defines the content to be set in targeted device twin or module twin desired properties. There are two inputs for each set of settings. The first is the twin path, which is the path to the JSON section within the twin desired properties that will be set. The second is the JSON content to be inserted in that section.
For example, you could set the twin path toproperties.desired.chiller-waterand then provide the following JSON content:
properties.desired.chiller-water
{
  "temperature": 66,
  "pressure": 28
}
{
  "temperature": 66,
  "pressure": 28
}

You can also set individual settings by specifying the entire twin path and providing the value with no brackets. For example, with the twin pathproperties.desired.chiller-water.temperature, set the content to66. Then create a new twin setting for the pressure property.
properties.desired.chiller-water.temperature
66
If two or more configurations target the same twin path, the content from the highest priority configuration will apply (priority is defined in step 4).
If you wish to remove an existing property, specify the property value tonull.
null
You can add additional settings by selectingAdd Device Twin SettingorAdd Module Twin Setting.
Target devices or modules
Use the tags property from your twins to target the specific devices or modules that should receive this configuration. You can also target twin reported properties.
Automatic device configurations can only target device twin tags, and automatic module configurations can only target module twin tags.
Since multiple configurations may target the same device or module, each configuration needs a priority number. If there's ever a conflict, the configuration with the highest priority wins.
Enter a positive integer for the configurationPriority. The highest numerical value is considered the highest priority. If two configurations have the same priority number, the one that was created most recently wins.
Enter a positive integer for the configurationPriority. The highest numerical value is considered the highest priority. If two configurations have the same priority number, the one that was created most recently wins.
Enter aTarget conditionto determine which devices or modules will be targeted with this configuration. The condition is based on twin tags or twin reported properties and should match the expression format.For automatic device configuration, you can specify just the tag or reported property to target. For example,tags.environment='test'orproperties.reported.chillerProperties.model='4000x'. You can specify*to target all devices.For automatic module configuration, use a query to specify tags or reported properties from the modules registered to the IoT hub. For example,from devices.modules where tags.environment='test'orfrom devices.modules where properties.reported.chillerProperties.model='4000x'. The wildcard cannot be used to target all modules.

Metrics
Metrics provide summary counts of the various states that a device or module may report back after applying configuration content. For example, you may create a metric for pending settings changes, a metric for errors, and a metric for successful settings changes.
Each configuration can have up to five custom metrics.
Enter a name forMetric Name.
Enter a name forMetric Name.
Enter a query forMetric Criteria.  The query is based on device twin reported properties.  The metric represents the number of rows returned by the query.For example:SELECT deviceId FROM devices 
  WHERE properties.reported.chillerWaterSettings.status='pending'You can include a clause that the configuration was applied, for example:/* Include the double brackets. */
SELECT deviceId FROM devices 
  WHERE configurations.[[yourconfigname]].status='Applied'If you're building a metric to report on configured modules, selectmoduleIdfromdevices.modules. For example:SELECT deviceId, moduleId FROM devices.modules
  WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200

If you're building a metric to report on configured modules, selectmoduleIdfromdevices.modules. For example:
moduleId
devices.modules
SELECT deviceId, moduleId FROM devices.modules
  WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200
SELECT deviceId, moduleId FROM devices.modules
  WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200

Modify a configuration
When you modify a configuration, the changes immediately replicate to all targeted devices or modules.
If you update the target condition, the following updates occur:
If a twin didn't meet the old target condition, but meets the new target condition and this configuration is the highest priority for that twin, then this configuration is applied.
If a twin didn't meet the old target condition, but meets the new target condition and this configuration is the highest priority for that twin, then this configuration is applied.
If a twin currently running this configuration no longer meets the target condition, the settings from the configuration will be removed and the twin will be modified by the next highest priority configuration.
If a twin currently running this configuration no longer meets the target condition, the settings from the configuration will be removed and the twin will be modified by the next highest priority configuration.
If a twin currently running this configuration no longer meets the target condition and doesn't meet the target condition of any other configurations, then the settings from the configuration will be removed and no other changes will be made on the twin.
