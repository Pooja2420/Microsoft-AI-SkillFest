Starting June 1, 2024, newly created App Service apps can generate a unique default host name that uses the naming convention<app-name>-<random-hash>.<region>.azurewebsites.net. For example:myapp-ds27dh7271aah175.westus-01.azurewebsites.net. Existing app names remain unchanged.
<app-name>-<random-hash>.<region>.azurewebsites.net
myapp-ds27dh7271aah175.westus-01.azurewebsites.net
For more information, see theblog post about creating a web app with a unique default host name.
Azure App Serviceprovides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. This guide shows you how to map an existing custom Domain Name System (DNS) name to App Service. To migrate a live site and its DNS domain name to App Service with no downtime, seeMigrate an active DNS name to Azure App Service.
The DNS record type you need to add with your domain provider depends on the domain you want to add to App Service.
Note
For an end-to-end tutorial that shows you how to configure awwwsubdomain and a managed certificate, seeTutorial: Secure your Azure App Service app with a custom domain and a managed certificate.

Prerequisites
Create an App Service app, or use an app that you created for another tutorial. The web app'sApp Service planmust be a paid tier, not the Free (F1) tier. SeeScale up an appto update the tier.
Make sure you can edit the DNS records for your custom domain. To edit DNS records, you need access to the DNS registry for your domain provider, such as GoDaddy. For example, to add DNS entries forcontoso.comandwww.contoso.com, you must be able to configure the DNS settings for thecontoso.comroot domain. Your custom domains must be in a public DNS zone; private DNS zones are not supported.
contoso.com
www.contoso.com
contoso.com
If you don't have a custom domain yet, you canpurchase an App Service domaininstead.
Configure a custom domain
In theAzure portal, navigate to your app's management page.
In theAzure portal, navigate to your app's management page.
In the left menu for your app, selectCustom domains.

ForTLS/SSL certificate, selectApp Service Managed Certificateif your app is in the Basic tier or higher. If you want to remain in the Shared tier, or if you want to use your own certificate, selectAdd certificate later.

ForTLS/SSL type, select the binding type you want.SettingDescriptionCustom domainThe domain name for which you're adding the TLS/SSL binding.Private Certificate ThumbprintThe certificate to bind.TLS/SSL TypeSNI SSL: Multiple Server Name Indication (SNI) SSL bindings might be added. This option allows multiple TLS/SSL certificates to secure multiple domains on the same IP address. Most modern browsers (including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera) support SNI (for more information, seeServer Name Indication).IP SSL: Only one IP SSL binding can be added. This option allows only one TLS/SSL certificate to secure a dedicated public IP address. After you configure the binding, follow the steps inRemap records for IP-based SSL.IP-based SSL is supported only in Standard tier or above.
ForTLS/SSL type, select the binding type you want.
ForDomain, specify a fully qualified domain name you want based on the domain you own. TheHostname record typebox defaults to the recommended DNS record to use, depending on whether the domain is a root domain (likecontoso.com), a subdomain (likewww.contoso.com), or a wildcard domain (like*.contoso.com).

For each custom domain in App Service, you need two DNS records with your domain provider. TheDomain validationsection shows you two DNS records that you must add with your domain provider. You can use the copy buttons to copy the value or values that you need in the next section.The following screenshot shows the default selections for awww.contoso.comdomain. It shows a CNAME record and a TXT record to add.WarningWhile it's not absolutely required to add the TXT record, it's highly recommended for security. The TXT record is adomain verification IDthat helps avoid subdomain takeovers from other App Service apps. For custom domains you previously configured without this verification ID, you should protect them from the same risk by adding the verification ID (the TXT record) to your DNS configuration. For more information on this common high-severity threat, seeSubdomain takeover.

Create the DNS records
Sign in to the website of your domain provider.You can use Azure DNS to manage DNS records for your domain and configure a custom DNS name for Azure App Service. For more information, seeTutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS.

Find the page for managing DNS records.Every domain provider has its own DNS records interface, so consult the provider's documentation. Look for areas of the site labeledDomain Name,DNS, orName Server Management.Often, you can find the DNS records page by viewing your account information and then looking for a link likeMy domains. Go to that page, and then look for a link that's named something likeZone file,DNS Records, orAdvanced configuration.The following screenshot is an example of a DNS records page:

Select the type of record to create and follow the instructions. You can use either aCNAME recordor anA recordto map a custom DNS name to App Service. When your function app is hosted in aConsumption plan, only the CNAME option is supported.
Root domain (for example, contoso.com)
Subdomain (for example, www.contoso.com)
Wildcard (CNAME)

Validate domain ownership and complete the mapping
Back in theAdd custom domaindialog in the Azure portal, selectValidate.
Back in theAdd custom domaindialog in the Azure portal, selectValidate.

If theDomain validationsection shows green check marks next to both domain records, you've configured them correctly. SelectAdd. If you see any errors or warnings, resolve them in the DNS record settings on your domain provider's website.NoteIf you configured the TXT record but not the A or CNAME record, App Service treats the change as adomain migrationscenario and allows the validation to succeed, but you won't see green check marks next to the records.

You should see the custom domain added to the list. You might also see a red X and the textNo binding.If you selectedApp Service Managed Certificateearlier, wait a few minutes for App Service to create the managed certificate for your custom domain. When the process is complete, the red X becomes a green check mark and you see the wordSecured. If you selectedAdd certificate later, the red X will remain until youadd a private certificate for the domainandconfigure the binding.NoteUnless you configure a certificate binding for your custom domain, any HTTPS request from a browser to the domain will receive an error or warning, depending on the browser.

Test the DNS resolution
Browse to the DNS names that you configured.


If you receive an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error when you browse to the URL of your custom domain, the two most likely causes are:
The browser client has cached the old IP address of your domain. Clear the cache and test the DNS resolution again. On a Windows machine, you can clear the cache withipconfig /flushdns.
ipconfig /flushdns
You configured an IP-based certificate binding, and the app's IP address has changed because of it.Remap the A recordin your DNS entries to the new IP address.
If you receive aPage not securewarning or error, it's because your domain doesn't have a certificate binding yet.Add a private certificate for the domainandconfigure the binding.
Page not secure
(Optional) Automate with scripts
You can automate management of custom domains with scripts by using theAzure CLIorAzure PowerShell.
