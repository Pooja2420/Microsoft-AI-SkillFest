Within the Profiler page, you can configure and view the .NET Profiler. TheApplication Insights Profiler for .NETpage has the following features.

Profile now
SelectProfile nowto start a profiling session on demand. When you select this link, all Profiler agents that are sending data to this Application Insights instance start to capture a profile. After 5 to 10 minutes, the profile session is shown in the list.
To manually trigger a Profiler session, you need, at minimum,writeaccess on your role for the Application Insights component. In most cases, you get write access automatically. If you're having issues, you need theApplication Insights Component Contributorsubscription scope role added. For more information, seeRoles, permissions, and security in Azure Monitor.
Trigger settings
SelectTriggersto open theTrigger Settingspane that has theCPU,Memory, andSamplingtrigger tabs.
CPU or Memory triggers
You can set up a trigger to start profiling when the percentage of CPU or memory use hits the level you set.

Sampling trigger
Unlike CPU or Memory triggers, an event doesn't trigger the Sampling trigger. Instead, it's triggered randomly to get a truly random sample of your application's performance.
You can:
Turn this trigger off to disable random sampling.
Set how often profiling occurs and the duration of the profiling session.

TheNormalsetting collects data 5% of the time, which is about 2 minutes per hour.
TheHighsetting profiles 50% of the time.
TheMaximumsetting profiles 75% of the time.
Recent profiling sessions
This section of theProfilerpage displays recent profiling session information. A profiling session represents the time taken by the Profiler agent while profiling one of the machines that hosts your application. Open the profiles from a session by selecting one of the rows. For each session, we show the following settings.
