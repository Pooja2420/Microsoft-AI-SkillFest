APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
When you create an Azure API Management service instance in the Azure cloud, Azure assigns it aazure-api.netsubdomain (for example,apim-service-name.azure-api.net). You can also expose your API Management endpoints using your own custom domain name, such ascontoso.com. This article shows you how to map an existing custom DNS name to endpoints exposed by an API Management instance.
azure-api.net
apim-service-name.azure-api.net
contoso.com
Important
API Management only accepts requests withhost headervalues matching:
The Gateway's default domain name
Any of the Gateway's configured custom domain names
Note
Currently, custom domain names aren't supported in aworkspace gateway.
Important
Changes to your API Management service's infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration.
While the service is updating, other service infrastructure changes can't be made. However, you can configure APIs, products, policies, and user settings. The service will not experience gateway downtime (except in the Developer tier).

Endpoints for custom domains
There are several API Management endpoints to which you can assign a custom domain name. Currently, the following endpoints are available:
<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net
<apim-service-name>.developer.azure-api.net
<apim-service-name>.management.azure-api.net
<apim-service-name>.configuration.azure-api.net
<apim-service-name>.scm.azure-api.net
Considerations
You can update any of the endpoints supported in your service tier. Typically, customers updateGateway(this URL is used to call the APIs exposed through API Management) andDeveloper portal(the developer portal URL).
The defaultGatewayendpoint remains available after you configure a custom Gateway domain name and cannot be deleted. For other API Management endpoints (such asDeveloper portal) that you configure with a custom domain name, the default endpoint is no longer available.
Only API Management instance owners can useManagementandSCMendpoints internally. These endpoints are less frequently assigned a custom domain name.
ThePremiumandDevelopertiers support setting multiple hostnames for theGatewayendpoint.
Wildcard domain names, like*.contoso.com, are supported in all tiers except the Consumption tier. A specific subdomain certificate (for example, api.contoso.com) would take precedence over a wildcard certificate (*.contoso.com) for requests to api.contoso.com.
*.contoso.com
Domain certificate options
API Management supports custom TLS certificates or certificates imported from Azure Key Vault. You can also enable a free, managed certificate.
Warning
If you require certificate pinning, please use a custom domain name and either a custom or Key Vault certificate, not the default certificate or the free, managed certificate. We don't recommend taking a hard dependency on a certificate that you don't manage.
Custom
Key Vault
Managed
If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it to your API Management instance. It must meet the following requirements. (If you enable the free certificate managed by API Management, it already meets these requirements.)
Exported as a PFX file, encrypted using triple DES, and optionally password protected.
Contains private key at least 2048 bits long
Contains all intermediate certificates and the root certificate in the certificate chain.
We recommend using Azure Key Vault tomanage your certificatesand setting them toautorenew.
autorenew
If you use Azure Key Vault to manage a custom domain TLS certificate, make sure the certificate is inserted into Key Vaultas acertificate, not asecret.
Caution
When using a key vault certificate in API Management, be careful not to delete the certificate, key vault, or managed identity used to access the key vault.
To fetch a TLS/SSL certificate, API Management must have the list and get secrets permissions on the Azure Key Vault containing the certificate.
When you use the Azure portal to import the certificate, all the necessary configuration steps are completed automatically.

If the certificate is set toautorenewand your API Management tier has an SLA (that is, in all tiers except the Developer tier), API Management will pick up the latest version automatically, without downtime to the service.
autorenew
For more information, seeUse managed identities in Azure API Management.
API Management offers a free, managed TLS certificate for your domain, if you don't wish to purchase and manage your own certificate. The certificate is autorenewed automatically.
Note
The free, managed TLS certificate is in preview. Currently, it's unavailable in the v2 service tiers.

DNS configuration
Configure a CNAME record for your custom domain.
When using API Management's free, managed certificate, also configure a TXT record to establish your ownership of the domain.
Note
The free certificate is issued by DigiCert. For some domains, you must explicitly allow DigiCert as a certificate issuer by creating aCAA domain recordwith the value:0 issue digicert.com.
0 issue digicert.com
CNAME record
Configure a CNAME record that points from your custom domain name (for example,api.contoso.com) to your API Management service hostname (for example,<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net). A CNAME record is more stable than an A-record in case the IP address changes. For more information, seeIP addresses of Azure API Managementand theAPI Management FAQ.
api.contoso.com
<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net
Note
Some domain registrars only allow you to map subdomains when using a CNAME record, such aswww.contoso.com, and not root names, such ascontoso.com. For more information on CNAME records, see the documentation provided by your registrar orIETF Domain Names - Implementation and Specification.
www.contoso.com
contoso.com
Caution
When you use the free, managed certificate and configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider, make sure that it resolves to the default API Management service hostname (<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net). Currently, API Management doesn't automatically renew the certificate if the CNAME record doesn't resolve to the default API Management hostname. For example, if you're using the free, managed certificate and you use Cloudflare as your DNS provider, make sure that DNS proxy isn't enabled on the CNAME record.
<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net
TXT record
When enabling the free, managed certificate for API Management, also configure a TXT record in your DNS zone to establish your ownership of the domain name.
The name of the record is your custom domain name prefixed byapimuid. Example:apimuid.api.contoso.com.
apimuid
apimuid.api.contoso.com
The value is a domain ownership identifier provided by your API Management instance.
When you use the portal to configure the free, managed certificate for your custom domain, the name and value of the necessary TXT record are automatically displayed.
You can also get a domain ownership identifier by calling theGet Domain Ownership IdentifierREST API.
How API Management proxy server responds with SSL certificates in the TLS handshake
When configuring a custom domain for the Gateway endpoint, you can set additional properties that determine how API Management responds with a server certificate, depending on the client request.
Clients calling with Server Name Indication (SNI) header
If you have one or multiple custom domains configured for the Gateway endpoint, API Management can respond to HTTPS requests from either:
Custom domain (for example,contoso.com)
contoso.com
Default domain (for example,apim-service-name.azure-api.net).
apim-service-name.azure-api.net
Based on the information in the SNI header, API Management responds with the appropriate server certificate.
Clients calling without SNI header
If you are using a client that does not send theSNIheader, API Management creates responses based on the following logic:
If the service has just one custom domain configured for Gateway, the default certificate is the certificate issued to the Gateway's custom domain.
If the service has just one custom domain configured for Gateway, the default certificate is the certificate issued to the Gateway's custom domain.
If the service has configured multiple custom domains for Gateway (supported in theDeveloperandPremiumtier), you can designate the default certificate by setting thedefaultSslBindingproperty to true ("defaultSslBinding":"true"). In the portal, select theDefault SSL bindingcheckbox.If you do not set the property, the default certificate is the certificate issued to the default Gateway domain hosted at*.azure-api.net.
If the service has configured multiple custom domains for Gateway (supported in theDeveloperandPremiumtier), you can designate the default certificate by setting thedefaultSslBindingproperty to true ("defaultSslBinding":"true"). In the portal, select theDefault SSL bindingcheckbox.
"defaultSslBinding":"true"
If you do not set the property, the default certificate is the certificate issued to the default Gateway domain hosted at*.azure-api.net.
*.azure-api.net
Support for PUT/POST request with large payload
API Management proxy server supports requests with large payloads (>40 KB) when using client-side certificates in HTTPS. To prevent the server's request from freezing, you can set thenegotiateClientCertificateproperty to true ("negotiateClientCertificate": "true") on the Gateway hostname. In the portal, select theNegotiate client certificatecheckbox.
"negotiateClientCertificate": "true"
If the property is set to true, the client certificate is requested at SSL/TLS connection time, before any HTTP request exchange. Since the setting applies at theGateway hostnamelevel, all connection requests ask for the client certificate. You can work around this limitation and configure up to 20 custom domains for Gateway (only supported in thePremiumtier).
