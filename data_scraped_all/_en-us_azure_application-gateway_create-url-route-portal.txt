You can use the Azure portal to configureURL path-based routing ruleswhen you create anapplication gateway. In this tutorial, you create backend pools using virtual machines. You then create routing rules that make sure web traffic arrives at the appropriate servers in the pools.
In this article, you learn how to:
Create an application gateway
Create virtual machines for backend servers
Create backend pools with the backend servers
Create a backend listener
Create a path-based routing rule

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription
Create virtual machines
In this example, you create three virtual machines to be used as backend servers for the application gateway. You also install IIS on the virtual machines to verify that the application gateway works as expected.

Note
You don't need to add a custom/* path rule to handle default cases. This is automatically handled by the default backend pool.
Note
Wildcard delimiter*is only honored at the end of the rule. For more information and supported path based rules examples, seeURL Path Based Routing overview.

Review the settings on theReview + createtab, and then selectCreateto create the virtual network, the public IP address, and the application gateway. It may take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully before moving on to the next section.

Change the URL tohttp://<ip-address>:8080/images/test.htm, replacing <ip-address> with the public IP address ofmyAppGateway, and you should see something like the following example:The listener on port 8080 routes this request to theImagesbackend pool.

Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the resource group and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group and selectDelete resource group.
