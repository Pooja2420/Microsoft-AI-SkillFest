To manage access to Azure resources, you must have the appropriate administrator role. Azure has an authorization system calledAzure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)with several built-in roles you can choose from. You can assign these roles at different scopes, such as management group, subscription, or resource group. By default, the person who creates a new Azure subscription can assign other users administrative access to a subscription.
This article describes how to add or change the administrator role for a user using Azure RBAC at the subscription scope.
This article applies to a Microsoft Online Service Program (pay-as-you-go) account or a Visual Studio account. If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (Azure plan) account, seeUnderstand Microsoft Customer Agreement administrative roles in Azure. If you have an Azure Enterprise Agreement, seeManage Azure Enterprise Agreement roles.
Microsoft recommends that you manage access to resources using Azure RBAC. Classic administrative roles are retired. For more information, seePrepare for Azure classic administrator roles retirement.

If you don't seeAccount Admin, you might have a Microsoft Customer Agreement. Instead,check your access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
Assign a subscription administrator

To make a user an administrator of an Azure subscription, an existing billing administrator assigns them theOwnerrole (an Azure role) at the subscription scope. The Owner role gives the user full access to all resources in the subscription, including the right to delegate access to others. These steps are the same as any other role assignment.
If you're not sure who the account billing administrator is for a subscription, use the following steps to find out.
Open theSubscriptions page in the Azure portal.
Select the subscription you want to check, and then look underSettings.
SelectProperties. The account billing administrator of the subscription is displayed in theAccount Adminbox.
