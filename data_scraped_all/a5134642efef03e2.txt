Note
Microsoft Entra Connect Health is not available in the China sovereign cloud.
Requirements
The following table lists requirements for using Microsoft Entra Connect Health:
https://login.microsoftonline.com
https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com
https://login.windows.net
https://aadcdn.msftauth.net
https://sts.contoso.com
Important
Windows Server Core doesn't support installing the Microsoft Entra Connect Health agent.
Note
If you have a highly locked-down and restricted environment, you need to add more URLs than the URLs the table lists for Internet Explorer enhanced security. Also add URLs that are listed in the table in the next section.
Important
If you installed Microsoft Entra Connect Sync using an account with the Hybrid Identity Administrator role, the agent will be in a disabled state.  To activate the agent, you will need to re-install it using an account that is a Global Administrator.
New versions of the agent and auto upgrade
If a new version of the health agent is released, any existing, installed agents are automatically updated.

Outbound connectivity to Azure service endpoints
During installation and runtime, the agent needs connectivity to Microsoft Entra Connect Health service endpoints. If firewalls block outbound connectivity, make sure that the URLs in the following table aren't blocked by default.
Don't disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs. Instead, allow them as you would allow other internet traffic.
These URLs allow communication with Microsoft Entra Connect Health service endpoints. Later in this article, you'll learn how tocheck outbound connectivityby usingTest-MicrosoftEntraConnectHealthConnectivity.
