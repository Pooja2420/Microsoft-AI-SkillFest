Amazon RDS and Azure relational database services
Azure provides several different relational database services that are the equivalent of AWS' Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). These include:
SQL Database
Azure Database for MySQL
Azure Database for PostgreSQL
Azure Database for MariaDB
Other database engines such asSQL Server,Oracle, andMySQLcan be deployed using Azure VM Instances.
Costs for Amazon RDS are determined by the amount of hardware resources that your instance uses, like CPU, RAM, storage, and network bandwidth. In the Azure database services, cost depends on your database size, concurrent connections, and throughput levels.
