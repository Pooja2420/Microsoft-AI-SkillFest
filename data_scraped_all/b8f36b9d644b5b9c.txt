Note
The "Run user flow" experience is not currently compatible with the SPA reply URL type using authorization code flow. To use the "Run user flow" experience with these kinds of apps, register a reply URL of type "Web" and enable the implicit flow as describedhere.
Create a sign-up and sign-in policy
Custom policies are a set of XML files you upload to your Azure AD B2C tenant to define user journeys. We provide starter packs with several pre-built policies including: sign-up and sign-in, password reset, and profile editing policy. For more information, seeGet started with custom policies in Azure AD B2C.
