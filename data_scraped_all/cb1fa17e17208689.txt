IoT Edge 1.5 LTS is thesupported release. IoT Edge 1.4 LTS is end of life as of November 12, 2024. If you are on an earlier release, seeUpdate IoT Edge.
You can visually explore metrics collected from IoT Edge devices using Azure Monitor workbooks. Curated monitoring workbooks for IoT Edge devices are provided in the form of public templates:
For devices connected to IoT Hub, from theIoT Hubpage in the Azure portal, navigate to theWorkbookspage in theMonitoringsection.
For devices connected to IoT Central, from theIoT Centralpage in the Azure portal, navigate to theWorkbookspage in theMonitoringsection.
Curated workbooks usebuilt-in metricsfrom the IoT Edge runtime. They first need metrics to beingestedinto a Log Analytics workspace. These views don't need any metrics instrumentation from the workload modules.
Access curated workbooks
Azure Monitor workbooks for IoT are a set of templates that you can use to visualize your device metrics. They can be customized to fit your solution.
To access the curated workbooks, use the following steps:
Sign in to theAzure portaland navigate to your IoT Hub or IoT Central application.

Fleet view workbook

By default, this view shows the health of devices associated with the current IoT cloud resource. You can select multiple IoT resources using the dropdown control on the top left.
Use theSettingstab to adjust the various thresholds to categorize the device as Healthy or Unhealthy.
Select theDetailsbutton to see the device list with a snapshot of aggregated, primary metrics. Select the link in theStatuscolumn to view the trend of an individual device's health metrics or the device name to view its detailed metrics.
Device details workbook
The device details workbook has three views:
TheMessagingview visualizes the message routes for the device and reports on the overall health of the messaging system.
TheModulesview shows how the individual modules on a device are performing.
TheHostview shows information about the host device including version information for host components and resource use.
Switch between the views using the tabs at the top of the workbook.
The device details workbook also integrates with the IoT Edge portal-based troubleshooting experience. You can pullLive logsfrom your device using this feature. Access this experience by selecting theTroubleshoot <device name> livebutton above the workbook.
Messaging
Modules
Host
Live logs

TheMessagingview includes three subsections: routing details, a routing graph, and messaging health. Drag and let go on any time chart to adjust the global time range to the selected range.
TheRoutingsection shows message flow between sending modules and receiving modules. It presents information such as message count, rate, and number of connected clients. Select a sender or receiver to drill in further. Clicking a sender shows the latency trend chart experienced by the sender and number of messages it sent. Clicking a receiver shows the queue length trend for the receiver and number of messages it received.
TheGraphsection shows a visual representation of message flow between modules. Drag and zoom to adjust the graph.
TheHealthsection presents various metrics related to overall health of the messaging subsystem. Progressively drill-in to details if any errors are noted.

TheModulesview presents metrics collected from the edgeAgent module, which reports on the status of all running modules on the device. It includes information such as:
Module availability
Per-module CPU and memory use
CPU and memory use across all modules
Modules restart count and restart timeline

TheHostview presents metrics from the edgeAgent module. It includes information such as:
Host component version information
Uptime
CPU, memory, and disk space use at the host-level

This workbook integrates directly with the portal-based troubleshooting experience. Click on theTroubleshoot livebutton to go to the troubleshoot screen. Here, you can easily view module logs pulled from the device, on-demand. The time range is automatically set to the workbook's time range, so you're immediately in temporal context. You can also restart any module from this experience.
Alerts workbook
See the generated alerts frompre-created alert rulesin theAlertsworkbook. This view lets you see alerts from multiple IoT Hubs or IoT Central applications.

Select a severity row to see alerts details. TheAlert rulelink takes you to the alert context and theDevicelink opens the detailed metrics workbook. When opened from this view, the device details workbook is automatically adjusted to the time range around when the alert fired.
Customize workbooks
Azure Monitor workbooksare very customizable. You can edit the public templates to suit your requirements. All the visualizations are driven by resource-centricKusto Query Languagequeries on theInsightsMetricstable.
To begin customizing a workbook, first enter editing mode. Select theEditbutton in the menu bar of the workbook. Curated workbooks make extensive use of workbook groups. You may need to selectEditon several nested groups before being able to view a visualization query.
Save your changes as a new workbook. You cansharethe saved workbook with your team ordeploy them programmaticallyas part of your organization's resource deployments.
