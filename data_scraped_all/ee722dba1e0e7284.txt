This article describes how to restoreAzure Managed Disksfrom a restore point created by Azure Backup. You can alsorestore Managed Disk using REST API.
Currently, the Original-Location Recovery (OLR) option of restoring by replacing existing the source disk from where the backups were taken isn't supported. You can restore from a recovery point to create a new disk either in the same resource group as that of the source disk from where the backups were taken or in any other resource group. This is known as Alternate-Location Recovery (ALR) and this helps to keep both the source disk and the restored (new) disk.
In this article, you'll learn how to:

Restore to create a new disk
Backup Vault uses Managed Identity to access other Azure resources. To restore from backup, Backup vaultâs managed identity requires a set of permissions on the resource group where the disk is to be restored.
Backup vault uses a system assigned managed identity, which is restricted to one per resource and is tied to the lifecycle of this resource. You can grant permissions to the managed identity by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). Managed identity is a service principal of a special type that may only be used with Azure resources. Learn more aboutManaged Identities.
The following pre-requisites are required to perform a restore operation:
Assign theDisk Restore Operatorrole to the Backup Vaultâs managed identity on the Resource group where the disk will be restored by the Azure Backup service.NoteYou can choose the same resource group as that of the source disk from where backups are taken or to any other resource group within the same or a different subscription.Go to the resource group where the disk is to be restored to. For example, the resource group isTargetRG.Go toAccess control (IAM)and selectAdd role assignmentsOn the right context pane, selectDisk Restore Operatorin theRoledropdown list. Select the backup vaultâs managed identity andSave.TipType the backup vault's name to select the vaultâs managed identity.

Type the backup vault's name to select the vaultâs managed identity.

Verify that the backup vault's managed identity has the right set of role assignments on the resource group where the disk will be restored.Go toBackup vault - > Identityand selectAzure role assignmentsVerify that the role, resource name, and resource type appear correctly.NoteWhile the role assignments are reflected correctly on the portal, it may take approximately 15 minutes for the permission to be applied on the backup vaultâs managed identity.During scheduled backups or an on-demand backup operation, Azure Backup stores the disk incremental snapshots in the Snapshot Resource Group provided during configuring backup of the disk. Azure Backup uses these incremental snapshots during the restore operation. If the snapshots are deleted or moved from the Snapshot Resource Group or if the Backup vault role assignments are revoked on the Snapshot Resource Group, the restore operation will fail.

If the disk to be restored is encrypted withcustomer-managed keys (CMK)or usingdouble encryption using platform-managed keys and customer-managed keys, then assign theReaderrole permission to the Backup Vaultâs managed identity on theDisk Encryption Setresource.

Once the prerequisites are met, follow these steps to perform the restore operation.
In theAzure portal, go toBackup center. SelectBackup instancesunder theManagesection. From the list of backup instances, select the disk backup instance for which you want to perform the restore operation.Alternately, you can perform this operation from the Backup vault you used to configure backup for the disk.

In theRestore parameterstab, select theTarget subscriptionandTarget resource groupwhere you want to restore the backup to. Provide the name of the disk to be restored. SelectNext: Review + restore.TipDisks being backed up by Azure Backup using the Disk Backup solution can also be backed up by Azure Backup using the Azure VM backup solution with the Recovery Services vault. If you have configured protection of the Azure VM to which this disk is attached, you can also use the Azure VM restore operation. You can choose to restore the VM, or disks and files or folders from the recovery point of the corresponding Azure VM backup instance. For more information, seeAzure VM backup.

Once the validation is successful, selectRestoreto start the restore operation.NoteValidation might take few minutes to complete before you can trigger restore operation. Validation may fail if:a disk with the same name  provided inRestored disk namealready exists in theTarget resource groupthe Backup vault's managed identity doesn't have valid role assignments on theTarget resource groupthe Backup vault's managed identity role assignments are revoked on theSnapshot resource groupwhere incremental snapshots are storedIf incremental snapshots are deleted or moved from the snapshot resource group

Note
Validation might take few minutes to complete before you can trigger restore operation. Validation may fail if:

If incremental snapshots are deleted or moved from the snapshot resource group
Restore will create a new disk from the selected recovery point in the target resource group that was provided during the restore operation. To use the restored disk on an existing virtual machine, you'll need to perform more steps:
If the restored disk is a data disk, you can attach an existing disk to a virtual machine. If the restored disk is OS disk, you can swap the OS disk of a virtual machine from the Azure portal under theVirtual machinepane - >Disksmenu in theSettingssection.

It's recommended that you revoke theDisk Restore Operatorrole assignment from the Backup vault's managed identity on theTarget resource groupafter the successful completion of restore operation.
Track a restore operation
After you trigger the restore operation, the backup service creates a job for tracking. Azure Backup displays notifications about the job in the portal. To view the restore job progress:
Go to theBackup instancescreen. It shows the jobs dashboard with operation and status for the past seven days.
