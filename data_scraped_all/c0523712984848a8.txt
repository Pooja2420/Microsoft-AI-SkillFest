A snapshot is a full, read-only copy of a virtual hard disk (VHD). You can use a snapshot as a point-in-time backup, or to help troubleshoot virtual machine (VM) issues. You can take a snapshot of both operating system (OS) or data disk VHDs. With snapshots, you can back up your managed disks at any point in time. These snapshots exist independently of the source disk, and you can use them to create new managed disks.
Snapshots are billed based on the used size. For example, if you create a snapshot of a managed disk with provisioned capacity of 64 GiB and an actual used data size of 10 GiB, that snapshot is billed only for the used data size of 10 GiB. You can see the used size of your snapshots by checking theAzure usage report. For example, if the used data size of a snapshot is 10 GiB, thedailyusage report shows 10 GiB/(31 days) = 0.3226 as the consumed quantity. Snapshots are billed separately from their original disk. For details, see thepricing page.
Create a snapshot of a VHD
If you want to use a snapshot to create a new VM, ensure that you first cleanly shut down the VM. This action clears any processes that are in progress.
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
To create a snapshot using the Azure portal, complete these steps.
In theAzure portal, selectCreate a resource.
Search for and selectSnapshot.
In theSnapshotwindow, selectCreate. TheCreate snapshotwindow appears.
ForResource group, select an existingresource groupor enter the name of a new one.
Enter aName, then select aRegionandSnapshot typefor the new snapshot. If you would like to store your snapshot in zone-resilient storage, you need to select a region that supportsavailability zones. For a list of supporting regions, seeAzure regions with availability zones.
ForSource subscription, select the subscription that contains the managed disk to be backed up.
ForSource disk, select the managed disk to snapshot.
ForStorage type, selectStandard HDD, unless you require zone-redundant storage or high-performance storage for your snapshot.
If needed, configure settings on theEncryption,Networking, andTagstabs. Otherwise, default settings are used for your snapshot.
SelectReview + create.
This example requires that you useCloud Shellor install theAzure PowerShell module.
Follow these steps to take a snapshot with theNew-AzSnapshotConfigandNew-AzSnapshotcmdlets. This example assumes that you have a VM calledmyVMin themyResourceGroupresource group. The code sample provided creates a snapshot in the same resource group and within the same region as your source VM.

First, you'll use theNew-AzSnapshotConfigcmdlet to create a configurable snapshot object. You can then use theNew-AzSnapshotcmdlet to take a snapshot of the disk.

Create the snapshot configuration. In the example, the snapshot is of the OS disk. By default, the snapshot uses locally redundant standard storage. We recommend that you store your snapshots in standard storage instead of premium storage whatever the storage type of the parent disk or target disk. Premium snapshots incur additional cost.$snapshot =  New-AzSnapshotConfig `
    -SourceUri $vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk.ManagedDisk.Id `
    -Location $location `
    -CreateOption copyIf you want to store your snapshot in zone-resilient storage, you must create the snapshot in a region that supportsavailability zonesand include the-SkuName Standard_ZRSparameter. For a list of regions that support availability zones, seeAzure regions with availability zones.

Next steps
To recover using a snapshot, you must create a new disk from the snapshot, then either deploy a new VM, and use the managed disk as the OS disk, or attach the disk as a data disk to an existing VM.
