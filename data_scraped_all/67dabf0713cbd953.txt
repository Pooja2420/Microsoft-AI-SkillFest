Azure VMware Solution private clouds are provisioned with a vCenter Server and NSX Manager. You use vCenter Server to manage virtual machine (VM) workloads and NSX Manager to manage and extend the private cloud. The CloudAdmin role is used for vCenter Server and the CloudAdmin role (with restricted permissions) is used for NSX Manager.
vCenter Server access and identity
In Azure VMware Solution, VMware vCenter Server has a built-in local user account calledCloudAdminthat's assigned the CloudAdmin role. You can configure users and groups in Windows Server Active Directory with the CloudAdmin role for your private cloud. In general, the CloudAdmin role creates and manages workloads in your private cloud. But in Azure VMware Solution, the CloudAdmin role has vCenter Server privileges that are different from other VMware cloud solutions and on-premises deployments.
Important
The local CloudAdmin user account should be used as an emergency access account for "break glass" scenarios in your private cloud. It's not intended to be used for daily administrative activities or for integration with other services.
In a vCenter Server and ESXi on-premises deployment, the administrator has access to the vCenter Server administrator@vsphere.local account and the ESXi root account. The administrator might also be assigned to more Windows Server Active Directory users and groups.
In a vCenter Server and ESXi on-premises deployment, the administrator has access to the vCenter Server administrator@vsphere.local account and the ESXi root account. The administrator might also be assigned to more Windows Server Active Directory users and groups.
In an Azure VMware Solution deployment, the administrator doesn't have access to the Administrator user account or the ESXi root account. But the administrator can assign Windows Server Active Directory users and groups the CloudAdmin role in vCenter Server. The CloudAdmin role doesn't have permissions to add an identity source like an on-premises Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Secure LDAP (LDAPS) server to vCenter Server. However, you can use Run commands to add an identity source and assign the CloudAdmin role to users and groups.

A user account in a private cloud can't access or manage specific management components that Microsoft supports and manages. Examples include clusters, hosts, datastores, and distributed virtual switches.
Note
In Azure VMware Solution, the vsphere.local single sign-on (SSO) domain is provided as a managed resource to support platform operations. You can't use it to create or manage local groups and users except for the ones that are provided by default with your private cloud.
Important
Azure VMware Solution offers custom roles on vCenter Server but currently doesn't offer them on the Azure VMware Solution portal. For more information, see theCreate custom roles on vCenter Serversection later in this article.
View the vCenter Server privileges
Use the following steps to view the privileges granted to the Azure VMware Solution CloudAdmin role on your Azure VMware Solution private cloud vCenter.
Sign in to the vSphere Client and go toMenu>Administration.

The CloudAdmin role in Azure VMware Solution has the following privileges on vCenter Server. For more information, see theVMware product documentation.
Create custom roles on vCenter Server
Azure VMware Solution supports the use of custom roles with equal or lesser privileges than the CloudAdmin role. Use the CloudAdmin role to create, modify, or delete custom roles with privileges less than or equal to their current role.
Note
You can create roles with privileges greater than CloudAdmin. However, you can't assign the role to any users or groups or delete the role. Roles that have privileges greater than that of CloudAdmin is unsupported.
To prevent creating roles that can't be assigned or deleted, clone the CloudAdmin role as the basis for creating new custom roles.
Sign in to vCenter Server with cloudadmin@vsphere.local or a user with the CloudAdmin role.

VMware NSX Manager access and identity
When a private cloud is provisioned using Azure portal, software-defined data center (SDDC) management components like vCenter Server and VMware NSX Manager are provisioned for customers.
Microsoft is responsible for the lifecycle management of NSX appliances like, VMware NSX Manager and VMware NSX Edge appliances. They're responsible for bootstrapping network configuration, like creating the Tier-0 gateway.
You're responsible for VMware NSX software-defined networking (SDN) configuration, for example:
Network segments
Other Tier-1 gateways
Distributed firewall rules
Stateful services like gateway firewall
Load balancer on Tier-1 gateways
You can access VMware NSX Manager using the built-in local user "cloudadmin" assigned to a custom role that gives limited privileges to a user to manage VMware NSX. While Microsoft manages the lifecycle of VMware NSX, certain operations aren't allowed by a user. Operations not allowed include editing the configuration of host and edge transport nodes or starting an upgrade. For new users, Azure VMware Solution deploys them with a specific set of permissions needed by that user. The purpose is to provide a clear separation of control between the Azure VMware Solution control plane configuration and Azure VMware Solution private cloud user.
For new private cloud deployments, VMware NSX access is provided with a built-in local user cloudadmin assigned to thecloudadminrole with a specific set of permissions to use VMware NSX functionality for workloads.
VMware NSX cloudadmin user permissions
The following permissions are assigned to thecloudadminuser in Azure VMware Solution NSX.
Note
VMware NSX cloudadmin useron Azure VMware Solution is not the same as thecloudadmin usermentioned in the VMware product documentation.
The following permissions apply to the VMware NSX Policy API.  Manager API functionality may be limited.
You can view the permissions granted to the Azure VMware Solution cloudadmin role on your Azure VMware Solution private cloud VMware NSX.
Sign in to the NSX Manager.
Navigate toSystemsand locateUsers and Roles.
Select and expand thecloudadminrole, found underRoles.
Select a category like, Networking or Security, to view the specific permissions.
Note
Private clouds created before June 2022will switch fromadminrole tocloudadminrole. You'll receive a notification through Azure Service Health that includes the timeline of this change so you can change the NSX credentials you've used for other integration.
NSX LDAP integration for role-based access control (RBAC)
In an Azure VMware Solution deployment, the VMware NSX can be integrated with external LDAP directory service to add remote directory users or group, and assign them a VMware NSX RBAC role, like on-premises deployment.  For more information on how to enable VMware NSX LDAP integration, see theVMware product documentation.
Unlike on-premises deployment, not all predefined NSX RBAC roles are supported with Azure VMware solution to keep Azure VMware Solution IaaS control plane config management separate from tenant network and security configuration. For more information, see the next section, Supported NSX RBAC roles.
Note
VMware NSX LDAP Integration is supported only with SDDCâs with VMware NSX âcloudadminâ user.
Supported and unsupported NSX RBAC roles
In an Azure VMware Solution deployment, the following VMware NSX predefined RBAC roles are supported with LDAP integration:
Auditor
Cloudadmin
LB Admin
LB Operator
VPN Admin
Network Operator
In an Azure VMware Solution deployment, the following VMware NSX predefined RBAC roles aren't supported with LDAP integration:
Enterprise Admin
Network Admin
Security Admin
NetX Partner Admin
GI Partner Admin
You can create custom roles in NSX with permissions lesser than or equal to CloudAdmin role created by Microsoft. Following are examples on how to create a supported "Network Admin" and "Security Admin" role.
Note
Custom role creation will fail if you assign a permission not allowed by CloudAdmin role.
Use the following steps to create this custom role.
Navigate toSystem>Users and Roles>Roles.
Navigate toSystem>Users and Roles>Roles.

Note
The VMware NSXSystem>Identity Firewall ADconfiguration option isn't supported by the NSX custom role. The recommendation is to assign theSecurity Operatorrole to the user with the custom role to allow managing the Identity Firewall (IDFW) feature for that user.
Note
The VMware NSX Traceflow feature isn't supported by the VMware NSX custom role. The recommendation is to assign theAuditorrole to the user along with the custom role to enable Traceflow feature for that user.
Note
VMware Aria Operations Automation integration with the NSX component of the Azure VMware Solution requires the âauditorâ role to be added to the user with the NSX Manager cloudadmin role.
