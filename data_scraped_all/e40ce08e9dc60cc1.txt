The need for access to privileged Azure resource and Microsoft Entra roles by your users changes over time. To reduce the risk associated with stale role assignments, you should regularly review access. You can use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to create access reviews for privileged access to Azure resource and Microsoft Entra roles. You can also configure recurring access reviews that occur automatically. This article describes how to create one or more access reviews.
Prerequisites
Using Privileged Identity Management requires licenses. For more information on licensing, seeMicrosoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals.
For more information about licenses for PIM, seeLicense requirements to use Privileged Identity Management.
To create access reviews for Azure resources, you must be assigned to theOwneror theUser Access Administratorrole for the Azure resources. To create access reviews for Microsoft Entra roles, you must be assigned at least thePrivileged Role Administratorrole.
Using Access Reviews forService Principalsrequires a Microsoft Entra Workload ID Premium plan in addition to a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license.
Workload Identities Premium licensing: You can view and acquire licenses on theWorkload Identities bladein the Microsoft Entra admin center.
Note
Access reviews capture a snapshot of access at the beginning of each review instance. Any changes made during the review process will be reflected in the subsequent review cycle. Essentially, with the commencement of each new recurrence, pertinent data regarding the users, resources under review, and their respective reviewers is retrieved.

Set theStart date. By default, an access review occurs once. It starts at creation time, and it ends in one month. You can change the start and end dates to have an access review start in the future and last however many days you want.

To make the access review recurring, change theFrequencysetting fromOne timetoWeekly,Monthly,Quarterly,Annually, orSemi-annually. Use theDurationslider or text box to specify review duration. For example, the maximum duration that you can set for a monthly review is 27 days, to avoid overlapping reviews.

Use theEndsetting to specify how to end the recurring access review series. The series can end in three ways: it runs continuously to start reviews indefinitely, until a specific date, or after a defined number of occurrences completes. You, or another administrator who can manage reviews, can stop the series after creation by changing the date inSettings, so that it ends on that date.

Or, you can create access reviews only for inactive users. In theUsers scopesection, set theInactive users (on tenant level) onlytotrue. If the toggle is set totrue, the scope of the review focuses on inactive users only. Then, specifyDays inactive. You can specify up to 730 days (two years). Users inactive for the specified number of days are the only users in the review.

SetShow recommendationstoEnableto show the reviewers the system recommendations based the user's access information. Recommendations are based on a 30-day interval period. Users who have logged in the past 30 days are shown with recommended approval of access, while users who haven't logged in are shown with recommended denial of access. These sign-ins are irrespective of whether they were interactive. The last sign-in of the user is also displayed along with the recommendation.

The content of the email sent to reviewers is autogenerated based on the review details, such as review name, resource name, due date, and so on. If you need a way to communicate additional information such as more instructions or contact information, you can specify these details in theAdditional content for reviewer emailare included in the invitation and reminder emails sent to assigned reviewers.

Manage the access review
You can track the progress as the reviewers complete their reviews on theOverviewpage of the access review. No access rights are changed in the directory until the review is completed.
After the access review, follow the steps inComplete an access review of Azure resource and Microsoft Entra rolesto see and apply the results.
If you are managing a series of access reviews, navigate to the access review, and you find upcoming occurrences in Scheduled reviews, and edit the end date or add/remove reviewers accordingly.
Based on your selections inUpon completion settings, auto-apply will be executed after the review's end date or when you manually stop the review. The status of the review changes fromCompletedthrough intermediate states such asApplyingand finally to stateApplied. You should expect to see denied users, if any, being removed from roles in a few minutes.

Impact of groups assigned to Microsoft Entra roles and Azure resource roles in access reviews
â¢	ForMicrosoft Entra roles, role-assignable groups can be assigned to the role usingrole-assignable groups. When a review is created on a Microsoft Entra role with role-assignable groups assigned, the group name shows up in the review without expanding the group membership. The reviewer can approve or deny access of the entire group to the role. Denied groups lose their assignment to the role when review results are applied.
â¢	ForAzure resource roles, any security group can be assigned to the role. When a review is created on an Azure resource role with a security group assigned, role reviewers can see a fully expanded view of the group's membership. When a reviewer denies a user that was assigned to the role via the security group, the user won't be removed from the group. This is because a group may be shared with other Azure or non-Azure resources. Administrators must implement the changes resulting from an access denial.
Note
It is possible for a security group to have other groups assigned to it. In this case, only the users assigned directly to the security group assigned to the role will appear in the review of the role.
Update the access review
After one or more access reviews have been started, you may want to modify or update the settings of your existing access reviews. Here are some common scenarios that you might want to consider:
Adding and removing reviewers- When updating access reviews, you may choose to add a fallback reviewer in addition to the primary reviewer. Primary reviewers may be removed when updating an access review. However, fallback reviewers aren't removable by design.NoteFallback reviewers can only be added when reviewer type is manager. Primary reviewers can be added when reviewer type is selected user.

Reminding the reviewers- When updating access reviews, you may choose to enable the reminder option under Advanced Settings. Once enabled, users receive an email notification at the midpoint of the review period. Reviewers receive notifications regardless of whether they have completed the review or not.

Updating the settings- If an access review is recurring, there are separate settings under "Current" versus under "Series". Updating the settings under "Current" will only apply changes to the current access review while updating the settings under "Series" will update the setting for all future recurrences.
