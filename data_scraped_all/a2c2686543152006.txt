In this article
Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB (preview) can assist with authoring Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL queries by generating queries based on your natural English-language prompts. Copilot is available to use in the API for NoSQL's query editor within the Data Explorer. With Copilot in the API for NoSQL, you can:
Ask questions about your data as you would in text or conversation to generate a NoSQL query.
Learn to write queries faster through detailed explanations of the generated query.
Note
You may see the databaseCopilotSampleDbappear in Data Explorer. This is a completely separate database managed by Microsoft and access is provided to you (at no cost) as a testbed to become familiar with Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB. This database consists of 100% synthetic data created by Microsoft and has has no interaction or relationships to any data you may have in Azure Cosmos DB.

Warning
Copilot is a preview feature that is powered by large language models (LLMs). Output produced by Copilot may contain inaccuracies, biases, or other unintended content. This occurs because the model powering Copilot was trained on information from the internet and other sources. As with any generative AI model, humans should review the output produced by Copilot before use.

Generate a query
You can use Copilot to generate NoSQL queries from natural language text on any container in your database.
Make sure the Copilot interface is enabled. You can enable the interface by selecting theCopilotbutton in the Data Explorer's menu.

Give feedback
We use feedback on generated queries to help improve and train Copilot. This feedback is crucial to improving the quality of the suggestions from Copilot.
To send feedback on queries, use the feedback mechanism within the query editor.

Select either thepositiveornegativefeedback option.Positive feedback triggers the tooling to send the generated query to Microsoft as a data point for where the Copilot was successful.Negative feedback triggers a dialog, which requests more information. The tooling sends this information, and the generated query, to Microsoft to help improve Copilot.

Write effective prompts
Here are some tips for writing effective prompts.
When crafting prompts for Copilot, be sure to start with a clear and concise description of the specific information you're looking. If you're unsure of your data's structure, run theSELECT TOP 1 - FROM cquery to see the first item in the container.

Use keywords and context that are relevant to the structure of items in your container. This context helps Copilot generate accurate queries. Specify properties and any filtering criteria as explicitly as possible. Copilot should be able to correct typos or understand context given the properties of the existing items in your container.

Avoid ambiguous or overly complex language in your prompts. Simplify the question while maintaining its clarity. This editing ensures Copilot can effectively translate it into a meaningful NoSQL query that retrieves the desired data from the container.

The following example prompts are clear, specific, and tailored to the properties of your data items, making it easier for Copilot to generate accurate NoSQL queries:Show me a productShow all products that have the word "ultra" in the name or descriptionFind the products from JapanCount all the products, group by each categoryShow me all names and prices of products that reviewed by someone with a username that contains "Mary"
