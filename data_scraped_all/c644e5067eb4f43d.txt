In thecustomer-managed keys concepts article, you learned about the encryption capabilities that Azure Machine Learning provides. Now learn how to use customer-managed keys with Azure Machine Learning.
Azure Machine Learning relies on the following services that use customer-managed keys:
You use the same key to help secure Azure Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, and Azure Storage. You can use a different key for Azure Kubernetes Service.
When you use a customer-managed key with Azure Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, and Azure Storage, the key is provided when you create your workspace. The key that you use with Azure Kubernetes Service is provided when you configure that resource.

Prerequisites
An Azure subscription.
An Azure subscription.
The following Azure resource providers must be registered:Resource providerWhy it's neededMicrosoft.MachineLearningServicesCreating the Azure Machine Learning workspace.Microsoft.StorageStorage Account is used as the default storage for the workspace.Microsoft.KeyVaultAzure Key Vault is used by the workspace to store secrets.Microsoft.DocumentDBAzure Cosmos DB instance that logs metadata for the workspace.Microsoft.SearchAzure AI Search provides indexing capabilities for the workspace.For information on registering resource providers, seeResolve errors for resource provider registration.
The following Azure resource providers must be registered:
For information on registering resource providers, seeResolve errors for resource provider registration.
Limitations
After workspace creation, the customer-managed encryption key for resources that the workspace depends on can only be updated to another key in the original Azure Key Vault resource..
Resources managed by Microsoft in your subscription can't transfer ownership to you.
You can't delete Microsoft-managed resources used for customer-managed keys without also deleting your workspace.
The key vault that contains your customer-managed key must be in the same Azure subscription as the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
OS disk of machine learning compute can't be encrypted with customer-managed key, but can be encrypted with Microsoft-managed key if the workspace is created withhbi_workspaceparameter set toTRUE. For more details, seeData encryption.
hbi_workspace
TRUE
Important
When using a customer-managed key, the costs for your subscription will be higher because of the additional resources in your subscription. To estimate the cost, use theAzure pricing calculator.
Create Azure Key Vault
To create the key vault, seeCreate a key vault. When creating Azure Key Vault, you must enablesoft deleteandpurge protection.
Important
The key vault must be in the same Azure subscription that will contain your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
Create a key
Tip
If you have problems creating the key, it may be caused by Azure role-based access controls that have been applied in your subscription. Make sure that the security principal (user, managed identity, service principal, etc.) you are using to create the key has been assigned theContributorrole for the key vault instance. You must also configure anAccess policyin key vault that grants the security principalCreate,Get,Delete, andPurgeauthorization.
If you plan to use a user-assigned managed identity for your workspace, the managed identity must also be assigned these roles and access policies.
For more information, see the following articles:

Create a workspace that uses a customer-managed key
Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace. When creating the workspace, you must select theAzure Key Vaultand thekey. Depending on how you create the workspace, you specify these resources in different ways:
Warning
The key vault that contains your customer-managed key must be in the same Azure subscription as the workspace.
Azure portal: Select the key vault and key from a dropdown input box when configuring the workspace.
Azure portal: Select the key vault and key from a dropdown input box when configuring the workspace.
SDK, REST API, and Azure Resource Manager templates: Provide the Azure Resource Manager ID of the key vault and the URL for the key. To get these values, use theAzure CLIand the following commands:# Replace `mykv` with your key vault name.
# Replace `mykey` with the name of your key.

# Get the Azure Resource Manager ID of the key vault
az keyvault show --name mykv --query id
# Get the URL for the key
az keyvault key show --vault-name mykv -n mykey --query key.kidThe key vault ID value will be similar to/subscriptions/{GUID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/mykv. The URL for the key will be similar tohttps://mykv.vault.azure.net/keys/mykey/{GUID}.
SDK, REST API, and Azure Resource Manager templates: Provide the Azure Resource Manager ID of the key vault and the URL for the key. To get these values, use theAzure CLIand the following commands:
# Replace `mykv` with your key vault name.
# Replace `mykey` with the name of your key.

# Get the Azure Resource Manager ID of the key vault
az keyvault show --name mykv --query id
# Get the URL for the key
az keyvault key show --vault-name mykv -n mykey --query key.kid
# Replace `mykv` with your key vault name.
# Replace `mykey` with the name of your key.

# Get the Azure Resource Manager ID of the key vault
az keyvault show --name mykv --query id
# Get the URL for the key
az keyvault key show --vault-name mykv -n mykey --query key.kid
The key vault ID value will be similar to/subscriptions/{GUID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/mykv. The URL for the key will be similar tohttps://mykv.vault.azure.net/keys/mykey/{GUID}.
/subscriptions/{GUID}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/mykv
https://mykv.vault.azure.net/keys/mykey/{GUID}
For examples of creating the workspace with a customer-managed key, see the following articles:
Once the workspace has been created, you'll notice that Azure resource group is created in your subscription. This group is in addition to the resource group for your workspace. This resource group will contain the Microsoft-managed resources that your key is used with. The resource group will be named using the formula of<Azure Machine Learning workspace resource group name><GUID>. It will contain an Azure Cosmos DB instance, Azure Storage Account, and Azure AI Search.
<Azure Machine Learning workspace resource group name><GUID>
Tip
TheRequest Unitsfor the Azure Cosmos DB instance automatically scale as needed.
If your Azure Machine Learning workspace uses a private endpoint, this resource group will also contain a Microsoft-managed Azure Virtual Network. This VNet is used to secure communications between the managed services and the workspace. Youcannot provide your own VNet for use with the Microsoft-managed resources. You alsocannot modify the virtual network. For example, you cannot change the IP address range that it uses.
Important
If your subscription does not have enough quota for these services, a failure will occur.
Warning
Don't delete the resource groupthat contains this Azure Cosmos DB instance, or any of the resources automatically created in this group. If you need to delete the resource group or Microsoft-managed services in it, you must delete the Azure Machine Learning workspace that uses it. The resource group resources are deleted when the associated workspace is deleted.
For more information on customer-managed keys with Azure Cosmos DB, seeConfigure customer-managed keys for your Azure Cosmos DB account.
Azure Container Instance
Important
Deploying to Azure Container Instances is not available in SDK or CLI v2. Only through SDK & CLI v1.
Important
This article provides information on using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1. The SDK v1 is deprecated as of March 31, 2025 and support for it will end on June 30, 2026. You're able to install and use the SDK v1 until that date.
We recommend that you transition to the SDK v2 before June 30, 2026. For more information on the SDK v2, seeWhat is the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2and theSDK v2 reference.
Important
Some of the Azure CLI commands in this article use theazure-cli-ml, or v1, extension for Azure Machine Learning. Support for the v1 extension will end on September 30, 2025. You're able to install and use the v1 extension until that date.
azure-cli-ml
We recommend that you transition to theml, or v2, extension before September 30, 2025. For more information on the v2 extension, seeAzure Machine Learning CLI extension and Python SDK v2.

Whendeployinga trained model to an Azure Container instance (ACI), you can encrypt the deployed resource using a customer-managed key. For information on generating a key, seeEncrypt data with a customer-managed key.
To use the key when deploying a model to Azure Container Instance, create a new deployment configuration usingAciWebservice.deploy_configuration(). Provide the key information using the following parameters:
AciWebservice.deploy_configuration()
cmk_vault_base_url: The URL of the key vault that contains the key.
cmk_vault_base_url
cmk_key_name: The name of the key.
cmk_key_name
cmk_key_version: The version of the key.
cmk_key_version
For more information on creating and using a deployment configuration, see the following articles:
