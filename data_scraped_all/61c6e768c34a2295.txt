Azure Key Vault is integrated with Azure Stack Edge resource for secret management. This article provides details on how an Azure Key Vault is created for Azure Stack Edge resource during device activation and is then used for secret management.
About key vault and Azure Stack Edge
Azure Key Vault cloud service is used to securely store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets. Key Vault also makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
For Azure Stack Edge service, the integration with key vault provides the following benefits:
Stores customer secrets. One of the secrets used for the Azure Stack Edge service is Channel Integrity Key (CIK). This key allows you to encrypt your secrets and is securely stored in the key vault. Device secrets such as BitLocker recovery key and Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) user password are also stored in the key vault.For more information, seeSecurely store secrets and keys.

Generate activation key and create key vault
A key vault is created for Azure Stack Edge resource during the process of activation key generation. The key vault is created in the same resource group where the Azure Stack Edge resource is present. Contributor permission is required on the key vault.
Prerequisites for key vault
Prior to the key vault creation during activation, the following prerequisites must be satisfied:
Register theMicrosoft.KeyVaultresource provider before you create the Azure Stack Edge resource. The resource provider is automatically registered if you have owner or contributor access to the subscription. The key vault is created in the same subscription and the resource group as the Azure Stack Edge resource.

The resource provider is automatically registered if you have owner or contributor access to the subscription. The key vault is created in the same subscription and the resource group as the Azure Stack Edge resource.
When you create an Azure Stack Edge resource, a system-assigned managed identity is also created that persists for the lifetime of the resource and communicates with the resource provider on the cloud.When the managed identity is enabled, Azure creates a trusted identity for the Azure Stack Edge resource.

When the managed identity is enabled, Azure creates a trusted identity for the Azure Stack Edge resource.
Key vault creation
After you have created the resource, you need to activate the resource with the device. To do so, you'll generate an activation key from the Azure portal.
When you generate an activation key, the following events occur:

You request an activation key in the Azure portal. The request is then sent to key vault resource provider.
A standard tier key vault with access policy is created and is locked by default.This key vault uses the default name or a 3 to 24 character long custom name that you specified. You cannot use a key vault that is already in use.The key vault details are stored in the service. This key vault is used for secret management and persists for as long as the Azure Stack Edge resource exists.

A resource lock is enabled on the key vault to prevent accidental deletion. A soft-delete is also enabled on the key vault that allows the key vault to be restored within 90 days if there is an accidental deletion. For more information, seeAzure Key Vault soft-delete overview.
A system-assigned managed identity that was created when you created the Azure Stack Edge resource, is now enabled.
A channel integrity key (CIK) is generated and placed in the key vault. The CIK details are displayed in the service.
A Zone redundant storage account (ZRS) is also created in the same scope as the Azure Stack Edge resource and a lock is placed on the account.This account is used to store the audit logs.The storage account creation is a long running process and takes a few minutes.The storage account is tagged with the key vault name.
This account is used to store the audit logs.
The storage account creation is a long running process and takes a few minutes.
The storage account is tagged with the key vault name.
A diagnostics setting is added to the key vault and the logging is enabled.
The managed identity is added to the key vault access policy to allow access to the key vault as the device uses the key vault to store and retrieve secrets.
The key vault authenticates the request with managed identity to generate activation key. The activation key is returned to the Azure portal. You can then copy this key and use it in the local UI to activate your device.
Note
If you had an existing Azure Stack Edge resource before the Azure Key Vault was integrated with Azure Stack Edge resource, you are not affected. You can continue to use your existing Azure Stack Edge resource.
The creation of key vault and storage account adds to the overall resource cost. For more information about allowed transactions and corresponding charges, seePricing for Azure Key VaultandPricing for Storage account.
If you run into any issues related to key vault and device activation, seeTroubleshoot device activation issues.
