Restore page is shown with an option to chooseGeo-redundant restore. If you have configured your server for geographically redundant backups, the server can be restored to the corresponding Azure paired region and the geo-redundant restore option can be enabled. Geo-redundant restore option restores the server to Latest UTC Now timestamp and hence after selection of Geo-redundant restore, the point-in-time restore options can't be selected simultaneously.

When primary region is down, one can't create geo-redundant servers in the respective geo-paired region as storage can't be provisioned in the primary region. One must wait for the primary region to be up to provision geo-redundant servers in the geo-paired region. With the primary region down one can still geo-restore the source server to the geo-paired region by disabling the geo-redundancy option in the Compute + Storage Configure Server settings in the restore portal experience and restore as a locally redundant server to ensure business continuity.

The new server created by geo restore has the same server admin sign-in name and password that was valid for the existing server at the time the restore was initiated. The password can be changed from the new server's Overview page. Additionally during a restore,Networkingsettings such as virtual network settings and firewall rules can be configured as described in the below section.

It means that only Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server instances can use that subnet.

Perform post-restore tasks
After the restore is completed, you should perform the following tasks to get your users and applications back up and running:
If the new server is meant to replace the original server, redirect clients and client applications to the new server.
Ensure appropriate virtual network rules are in place for users to connect. These rules aren't copied over from the original server.
Ensure appropriate logins and database level permissions are in place.
Configure alerts as appropriate for the newly restored server.
Common Errors:
Restore to same server name is currently unsupported. It's recommended to use a different name when initiating the restore process, otherwise restore operations will fail.
