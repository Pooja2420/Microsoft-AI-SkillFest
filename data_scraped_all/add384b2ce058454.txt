Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes allows you to attach Kubernetes clusters running anywhere so that you can manage and configure them in Azure. By managing all of your Kubernetes resources in a single control plane, you can enable a more consistent development and operation experience, helping you run cloud-native apps anywhere and on any Kubernetes platform.
When theAzure Arc agents are deployed to the cluster, an outbound connection to Azure is initiated, using industry-standard SSL to secure data in transit.
Clusters that you connect to Azure are represented as their own resources in Azure Resource Manager, and they can be organized using resource groups and tagging.
Supported Kubernetes distributions
Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes works with any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters. This includes clusters running on other public cloud providers (such as GCP or AWS) and clusters running on your on-premises data center (such as VMware vSphere or Azure Local).
The Azure Arc team has worked with key industry partners tovalidate conformance of their Kubernetes distributions with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.
Scenarios and enhanced functionality
Once your Kubernetes clusters are connected to Azure, at scale you can:
View all connected Kubernetes clusters for inventory, grouping, and tagging, along with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.
