Release triggers are an automation tool that can be used in your deployment workflow to initiate actions when specific conditions are met. after certain conditions are met. Classic release pipelines support several types of triggers, which we'll cover in this article:

Continuous deployment triggers
Continuous deployment triggers enable you to automatically create a release whenever a new artifact becomes available. By Using the build branch filters you can trigger deployment for a specific target branch. A release is triggered only for pipeline artifacts originating from one of the selected branches.
For example, selectingmainwill trigger a release every time a new artifact becomes available from the main branch. To trigger a release for any build under 'features/', enter 'features/'. To trigger a release for all builds, use ''. Note that all specified filters will be OR'ed meaning any artifact matching at least one filter condition will trigger a release.

Pull request triggers
If you chose to enable the pull-request triggers, a release will be triggered whenever a new version of the selected artifact is created by the pull request pipeline workflow. To use a pull request trigger, you must also enable it for specific stages (covered in the next section). You may also want to set upbranch policiesfor your branches.
