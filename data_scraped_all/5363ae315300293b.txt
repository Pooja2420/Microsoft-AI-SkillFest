To create anintegrated multicloud experience, Microsoft and Oracle offer direct interconnection between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) throughExpressRouteandFastConnect. Through the ExpressRoute and FastConnect interconnection, you can experience low latency, high throughput, private direct connectivity between the two clouds.
Important
Oracle has certified these applications to run in Azure when using the Azure / Oracle Cloud interconnect solution:
E-Business Suite
JD Edwards EnterpriseOne
PeopleSoft
Oracle Retail applications
Oracle Hyperion Financial Management
The following image shows a high-level overview of the interconnection:

Note
The ExpressRoute connection seen in the diagram is a regularExpressRoute circuitand supports all fuctionality, such as Global Reach.
Prerequisites
To establish connectivity between Azure and OCI, you must have an active Azure subscription and an active OCI tenancy.

Connectivity is only possible where an Azure ExpressRoute peering location is in proximity to or in the same peering location as the OCI FastConnect. SeeRegion Availability.

The first IP address space is theprimary address spaceand the second IP address space is thesecondary address space. You need these addresses when you configure your FastConnect circuit.

Connect virtual network to ExpressRoute
Create a virtual network and virtual network gateway, if you haven't already. For more information, seeConfigure a virtual network gateway for ExpressRoute using the Azure portal.
Set up the connection between the virtual network gateway and your ExpressRoute circuit by using theTerraform scriptor by using the PowerShell command toConfigure ExpressRoute FastPath.
Once you completed the network configuration, you can verify your configuration by selectingGet ARP RecordsandGet route tableunder the ExpressRoute Private peering page in the Azure portal.
Automation
Microsoft created Terraform scripts to enable automated deployment of the network interconnect. The Terraform scripts need to authenticate with Azure before they run, because they require adequate permissions on the Azure subscription. Authentication can be performed using anMicrosoft Entra service principalor using the Azure CLI. For more information, seeCLI Authentication.
For the Terraform scripts and related documentation to deploy the inter-connect, seeAzure-OCI Cloud Inter-Connect.
Monitoring
Installing agents on both the clouds, you can use AzureNetwork Performance Monitorto monitor the performance of the end-to-end network. Network Performance Monitor helps you to readily identify network issues, and helps eliminate them.
Delete the interconnect link
To delete the interconnect, perform these steps in the order given. Failure to do so results in afailed stateExpressRoute circuit.
Delete the ExpressRoute connection. Delete the connection by selecting theDeleteicon on the page for your connection. For more information, seeClean up resources.
Delete the Oracle FastConnect from the Oracle Cloud Console.
Once the Oracle FastConnect circuit is deleted, you can delete the Azure ExpressRoute circuit.
The delete and deprovisioning process is complete.
