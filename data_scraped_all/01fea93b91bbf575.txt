User profile management for Azure Virtual Desktop with FSLogix profile containers
Article

A user profile contains data elements about an individual, including configuration information like desktop settings, persistent network connections, and application settings. By default, Windows creates a local user profile that is tightly integrated with the operating system.
If you configure a user profile to be remote, it provides a partition between user data and the operating system. You can change or replace the operating system without affecting the user data. With a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solution, such as Azure Virtual Desktop, the operating system might be replaced for the following reasons:
An upgrade of the operating system.
A replacement of an existing session host.
A user is assigned to a pooled host pool where they might connect to a different session host each time they sign in.
We recommend usingFSLogix profile containerswith Azure Virtual Desktop to manage and roam user profiles and personalization. FSLogix profile containers store a complete user profile in a single container. At sign in, this container is dynamically attached to the remote session as a natively supported Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX or VHD) file. The user profile is immediately available and appears in the system exactly like a native user profile. This article describes how FSLogix profile containers work with Azure Virtual Desktop.

FSLogix profile containers
Existing and legacy Microsoft solutions for user profiles came with various challenges. No previous solution handled all the user profile needs of a VDI environment.
FSLogix profile containers address many user profile challenges. Key among them are:
Performance:FSLogix profile containersare high performance and can resolve performance issues that historically blocked cached Exchange mode in Microsoft Outlook.

Best practices for Azure Virtual Desktop
Azure Virtual Desktop offers full control over size, type, and count of VMs that are being used by customers. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Virtual Desktop?.
To ensure your Azure Virtual Desktop environment follows best practices:
We recommend you use Azure Files or Azure NetApp Files to store profile containers. To compare the different FSLogix Profile Container storage options on Azure, seeStorage options for FSLogix profile containers.The storage account must be in the same region as the session host VMs.Azure Files permissions should match permissions described inConfigure SMB Storage Permissions for FSLogix.Azure Files has limits on the number of open handles per root directory, directory, and file. For more information on the limits and sizing guidance, seeAzure Files scalability and performance targetsandAzure Files sizing guidance for Azure Virtual Desktop.
