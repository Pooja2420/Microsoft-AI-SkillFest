Batch service quotas and limits

As with other Azure services, there are limits on certain resources associated with Azure Batch. For example, if your pool doesn't reach your target number of compute nodes, you might have reached the core quota limit for your Batch account. Many limits are default quotas, which Azure applies at the subscription or account level.
Keep these quotas in mind as you design and scale up your Batch workloads. You can run multiple Batch workloads in a single Batch account. Or, you can distribute your workloads among Batch accounts in the same subscription but different Azure regions. If you plan to run production workloads in Batch, you might need to increase one or more of the quotas above the default. To raise a quota,request a quota increaseat no charge.
Resource quotas
A quota is a limit, not a capacity guarantee. If you have large-scale capacity needs, contact Azure support.
Also note that quotas aren't guaranteed values. Quotas can vary based on changes from the Batch service or a user request to change a quota value.
1For capacity management purposes, the default quotas for new Batch accounts in some regions and for some subscription
types have been reduced from the above range of values. In some cases, these limits have been reduced to zero. When you create a
new Batch account,check your quotasandrequest an appropriate core or service quota increase, if necessary.
Alternatively, consider reusing Batch accounts that already have sufficient quota or user subscription pool allocation
Batch accounts to maintain core and VM family quota across all Batch accounts on the subscription. Service quotas like
active jobs or pools apply to each distinct Batch account even for user subscription pool allocation Batch accounts.
2To request an increase beyond this limit, contact Azure Support.
Note
Default limits vary depending on the type of subscription you use to create a Batch account. Cores quotas shown are for Batch
accounts in Batch service mode.View the quotas in your Batch account.
Core quotas
Core quotas in Batch service mode
Core quotas exist for each virtual machine (VM) series supported by Batch. These core quotas are displayed on theQuotaspage in the Azure portal. To update VM series quota limits,open a support request.
For dedicated nodes, Batch enforces a core quota limit for each VM series, and a total core quota limit for the entire Batch account.
For Spot nodes, Batch enforces only a total core quota for the Batch account without any distinction between different VM series.
Core quotas in user subscription mode
If you created aBatch accountwith pool allocation mode set touser subscription, Batch VMs and other resources are created directly in your subscription when a pool is created or resized. The Azure Batch core quotas don't apply and the quotas in your subscription for regional compute cores, per-series compute cores, and other resources are used and enforced.
To learn more about these quotas, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints.
Pool size limits
Pool size limits are set by the Batch service. Unlikeresource quotas, these values can't be changed. Only pools with inter-node communication and custom images have restrictions different from the standard quota.
1For pools that aren't inter-node communication enabled.
Other limits
The Batch service sets the following other limits. Unlikeresource quotas, it's not possible to change these values.
1The maximum lifetime of a task, from when it's added to the job to when it completes, is 180 days. By default, data is retained for completed tasks for seven days if the compute node where it ran is still available. Data for tasks not completed within the maximum lifetime isn't accessible. Completed task data retention times are configurable on a per task basis.

Increase a quota
You can request a quota increase for your Batch account or your subscription using theAzure portalor by using theAzure Quota REST API.
The type of quota increase depends on the pool allocation mode of your Batch account. To request a quota increase, you must include the VM series for which you would like to increase the quota. When the quota increase is applied, it's applied to all series of VMs.
Once you've submitted your support request, Azure support will contact you. Quota requests may be completed within a few minutes or up to two business days.
Quota types
You can select from two quota types when youcreate your support request.
SelectPer Batch accountto request quota increases for a single Batch account. These quota increases can include dedicated and Spot cores, and the number of jobs and pools. If you select this option, specify the Batch account to which this request applies. Then, select the quota(s) you'd like to update. Provide the new limit you're requesting for each resource. The Spot quota is a single value across all VM series. If you need constrained SKUs, selectSpot coresand include the VM families to request.
SelectAll accounts in this regionto request quota increases that apply to all Batch accounts in a region. For example, use this option to increase the number of Batch accounts per region per subscription.

Request through Azure Quota REST API
You can use the Azure Quota REST API to request a quota increase at the subscription level or at the Batch account level.
For details and examples, seeRequest a quota increase using the Azure Support REST API.
Related quotas for VM pools
Batch pools in a VM configuration deployed in an Azure virtual networkautomatically allocate more Azure networking resources. These resources are created in the subscription that contains the virtual network supplied when creating the Batch pool.
The following resources are created for each 100 pool nodes in a virtual network:
Onenetwork security group
Onepublic IP address
Oneload balancer
These resources are limited by the subscription'sresource quotas. If you plan large pool deployments in a virtual network, you may need to request a quota increase for one or more of these resources.
