Public endpoints forAzure SQL Managed Instanceenable data access to your managed instance from outside thevirtual network. You're able to access your managed instance from multitenant Azure services like Power BI, Azure App Service, or an on-premises network. By using the public endpoint on a managed instance, you don't need to use a VPN, which can help avoid VPN throughput issues.
In this article, you learn how to:
Enable or disable a public endpoint for your managed instance
Configure your managed instance network security group (NSG) to allow traffic to the managed instance public endpoint
Obtain the managed instance public endpoint connection string
Permissions
Due to the sensitivity of data in a managed instance, the configuration to enable managed instance public endpoint requires a two-step process. This security measure adheres to separation of duties (SoD):
The managed instance admin needs to enable the public endpoint on the managed instance. The managed instance admin can be found on theOverviewpage for your managed instance resource.
A network admin needs to allow traffic to the managed instance using a network security group (NSG). For more information, reviewnetwork security group permissions.
Enable public endpoint
You can enable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.
Azure portal
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
To enable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance in the Azure portal, follow these steps:
Go to theAzure portal.
Open the resource group with the managed instance, and select theSQL managed instancethat you want to configure public endpoint on.
On theSecuritysettings, select theNetworkingtab.
In the Virtual network configuration page, selectEnableand then theSaveicon to update the configuration.

To enable the public endpoint with PowerShell, set-PublicDataEndpointEnabledtotruewhen you update instance properties withSet-AzSqlInstance.
-PublicDataEndpointEnabled
Use the sample PowerShell script to enable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance. Replace the following values:
subscription-idwith your subscription ID
rg-namewith the resource group of your managed instance
mi-namewith the name of your managed instance
To enable the public endpoint by using PowerShell, run the following script:
Install-Module -Name Az

Import-Module Az.Accounts
Import-Module Az.Sql

Connect-AzAccount

# Use your subscription ID in place of subscription-id below

Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId {subscription-id}

# Replace rg-name with the resource group for your managed instance, and replace mi-name with the name of your managed instance

$mi = Get-AzSqlInstance -ResourceGroupName {rg-name} -Name {mi-name}

$mi = $mi | Set-AzSqlInstance -PublicDataEndpointEnabled $true -force
Install-Module -Name Az

Import-Module Az.Accounts
Import-Module Az.Sql

Connect-AzAccount

# Use your subscription ID in place of subscription-id below

Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId {subscription-id}

# Replace rg-name with the resource group for your managed instance, and replace mi-name with the name of your managed instance

$mi = Get-AzSqlInstance -ResourceGroupName {rg-name} -Name {mi-name}

$mi = $mi | Set-AzSqlInstance -PublicDataEndpointEnabled $true -force
To enable the public endpoint with the Azure CLI,  set--public-data-endpoint-enabledtotruewhen you update instance properties withaz sql mi update.
--public-data-endpoint-enabled
Use the sample Azure CLI command to enable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance. Replace the following values:
subscriptionwith your subscription ID
rg-namewith the resource group of your managed instance
mi-namewith the name of your managed instance
To enable the public endpoint by using the Azure CLI, run the following command:
az sql mi update --subscription {subscription-id} --resource-group {rg-name} --name {mi-name} --public-data-endpoint-enabled true
az sql mi update --subscription {subscription-id} --resource-group {rg-name} --name {mi-name} --public-data-endpoint-enabled true
Disable public endpoint
You can disable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure CLI.
Azure portal
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
To disable the public endpoint by using the Azure portal, follow these steps:
Go to theAzure portal.
Open the resource group with the managed instance, and select theSQL managed instancethat you want to configure public endpoint on.
On theSecuritysettings, select theNetworkingtab.
In the Virtual network configuration page, selectDisableand then theSaveicon to update the configuration.
To disable the public endpoint with PowerShell, set-PublicDataEndpointEnabledtofalsewhen you update instance properties withSet-AzSqlInstance.
-PublicDataEndpointEnabled
Use Azure PowerShell to disable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance. Remember to also close the inbound security rule for port 3342 in your network security group (NSG) if you'veconfigured it.
To disable the public endpoint, use the following command:
Set-AzSqlInstance -PublicDataEndpointEnabled $false -force
Set-AzSqlInstance -PublicDataEndpointEnabled $false -force
To disable the public endpoint with the Azure CLI,  set--public-data-endpoint-enabledtofalsewhen you update instance properties withaz sql mi update.
--public-data-endpoint-enabled
Use the Azure CLI to disable the public endpoint for your SQL Managed Instance. Replace the following values:
subscriptionwith your subscription ID
rg-namewith the resource group of your managed instance
mi-namewith the name of your managed instance.
Remember to also close the inbound security rule for port 3342 in your network security group (NSG) if you'veconfigured it.
To disable the public endpoint, use the following command:
az sql mi update --subscription {subscription-id} --resource-group {rg-name} --name {mi-name} --public-data-endpoint-enabled false
az sql mi update --subscription {subscription-id} --resource-group {rg-name} --name {mi-name} --public-data-endpoint-enabled false
Allow public endpoint traffic in the network security group
Use the Azure portal to allow public traffic within the network security group. Follow these steps:
Go to theOverviewpage for your SQL Managed Instance in theAzure portal.
Go to theOverviewpage for your SQL Managed Instance in theAzure portal.
Select theVirtual network/subnetlink, which takes you to theVirtual network configurationpage.
Select theVirtual network/subnetlink, which takes you to theVirtual network configurationpage.

Select theSubnetstab on the configuration pane of your Virtual network, and make note of theSECURITY GROUPname for your managed instance.
Select theSubnetstab on the configuration pane of your Virtual network, and make note of theSECURITY GROUPname for your managed instance.

Go back to the resource group that contains your managed instance. You should see theNetwork security groupname noted previously. Select theNetwork security groupname to open theNetwork Security Groupconfiguration page.

Confirm that routing is properly configured
A route with the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix instructs Azure how to route traffic destined for an IP address that is not within the address prefix of any other route in a subnet's route table. When a subnet is created, Azure creates a default route to the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix, with theInternetnext hop type.
Overriding this default route without adding the necessary route(s) to ensure the public endpoint traffic is routed directly toInternetmay cause asymmetric routing issues since incoming traffic does not flow via the Virtual appliance/Virtual network gateway. Ensure that all traffic reaching the managed instance over public internet goes back out over public internet as well by either adding specific routes for each source or setting the default route to the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix back toInternetas next hop type.
See more the details about impact of changes on this default route at0.0.0.0/0 address prefix.
Obtain the public endpoint connection string
Navigate to the managed instance configuration page that has been enabled for public endpoint. Select theConnection stringstab under theSettingsconfiguration.
Navigate to the managed instance configuration page that has been enabled for public endpoint. Select theConnection stringstab under theSettingsconfiguration.
The public endpoint host name comes in the format <mi_name>.public.<dns_zone>.database.windows.net and that the port used for the connection is 3342. Here's an example of a server value of the connection string denoting the public endpoint port that can be used in SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio connections:<mi_name>.public.<dns_zone>.database.windows.net,3342
