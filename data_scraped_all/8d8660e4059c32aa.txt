VM watch is a standardized, lightweight, and adaptable service offering for virtual machines (VMs) and virtual machine scale sets. It runs health checks within a VM at configurable intervals and sends the results via a uniform data model to Azure. The AI operations (AIOps) engines for production monitoring in Azure consume these health results for regression detection and prevention.
VM watch is delivered via theApplication Health VM extensionto provide ease of deployment and manageability for customers. In addition, VM watch is offered at no extra cost.
