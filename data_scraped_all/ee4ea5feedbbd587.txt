A number of tools and clients connect to Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server, the on-premises platform. Here you can learn which versions of browsers and clients can interface with Azure DevOps, as well as the on-premises Azure DevOps build server.
To learn more about supported clients, seeWhich tools and clients connect to Azure DevOps.

Web portal supported browsers
To connect with the web portal, you can use the following browsers with Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps on-premises. Edge, Firefox, and Chrome automatically update themselves,
so Azure DevOps supports the most recent version.

Visual Studio and Team Explorer
There are three levels of client support for different versions of Visual Studio and Team Explorer.
Only the latest version has full compatibility with the latest Azure DevOps on-premises server because it's the only client:
That includes components that can interface with new features for that release.
You can use to run certain administrative tasks such as creating new projects.
Previous versions have varying levels of support based on how old they are.
The following table describes the level of support that's guaranteed with each client version. Additional functionality other than what's listed here might continue to work if you use older clients. It often does work, but it's outside the scope of what's officially tested and supported.
Any Azure DevOps functionality exposed in the UI of Visual Studio and Team Explorer should work. We guarantee full feature support between client and server of the same version.
Note
If you use the latest version of Visual Studio but plan to continue to use the most recent previous version of Azure DevOps Server, either temporarily or permanently, you can expect a high level of compatibility.
All non-administrative scenarios are supported.
High level of support
If you're on Azure DevOps Server 2019 and you run the most recent previous version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer, for example, Visual Studio 2019, you can expect support from Visual Studio for most features.
You might need to install the latest update. After installation, mainline scenarios for all non-administrative tasks are supported.
This support is for features that developers and testers need to continue their daily work. These features are used to queue builds, run queries, view documents, and get, edit, and check in files. Program managers also should be able to continue to use most features relevant to them. They might need to rely on web access for some scenarios. These scenarios occur when they manage areas and iterations and write new queries.
If you use newer versions of Visual Studio against older versions of Team Foundation Server, you can similarly expect most features to be supported.
Older process templates that were in use with the previous version of Team Foundation Server should continue to be compatible with the new server.
General support
If a client is two versions older than your server, you can expect general support after you install a compatibility GDR. This support is similar to the high level of support you see when Visual Studio is one release older than Azure DevOps Server. The experience for some non-mainline scenarios might be degraded but not entirely blocked. Non-admins should be able to continue unimpeded in their daily work. Older process templates should remain compatible with the new server.
Azure DevOps Office integration
Office integration with Azure DevOps supportsExcel.
Important
Starting with Azure DevOps Server 2019 and Visual Studio 2019, the Azure DevOps Office Integration plug-in has deprecated support for Microsoft Project and Microsoft PowerPoint with Storyboarding. Project integration and theTFSFieldMappingcommand are not supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions, nor for Azure DevOps Services. The plug-in continues to support Microsoft Excel.
TFS Build agents and controllers
A newscriptable build systemis web based and cross-platform.
You might want to use an older version of Build if you plan to continue to use:
The XAML Build system.
Build servers against multiple versions of TFS.
Servers with older operating systems in your TFS deployment.
