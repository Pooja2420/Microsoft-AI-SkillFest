Create manual test cases to check that each deliverable meets your users' needs. Manual test cases define individual steps testers perform, including steps that are shared across test cases. To test different data, you specify parameters for the test steps. For more information, seeShare steps between test casesandRepeat a test with different data. For an overview of test artifacts, seeTest objects and terms.
Organize your test cases by adding them to test plans and test suites, and then assign testers to run the tests. For more information, seeTest objects and terms.
Note
Test iterations are designed to support data-driven scenarios, not workflow-driven scenarios.
From a best practice perspective, if you have two test scenarios where the workflows are
different, consider creating separate test cases. Also seeFAQs for manual testing.
Prerequisites
For more information, seeManual test access and permissions.

Create test cases
If you haven't already,create a test plan and requirement-based test suites.

Select a requirement-based test suite and selectNew Test Case.NoteThetest suiteshown here was created from a User Story work item in the team's backlog board. When you add a test case to this kind of suite, the test case automatically links to the backlog item. To create test cases this way, open the context menu for the work item and chooseAdd test.
Select a requirement-based test suite and selectNew Test Case.

In the new work item, enter a title and selectClick or type here to add a step.

Add test steps with a description of the action required to carry out the test and the expected results so that any team member can run the test. You can add attachments to a step if you want. Repeat until you add all the steps for the test.A test case that you can run gets created.For more information, seeShare stepsandCopy or clone stories, issues and other work items.

Assign configurations to test cases
You can specify configurations, such as different operating systems, web browsers, and other variations for your tests.
Select the test suite >More options>Assign configurations, and in the dialog box, select your configurations.

You can also assign configurations to individual test cases. Select one or more test cases, selectMore options>Assign configuration.
Make your changes and thenSave.
For more information, seeTest different configurations.
Reorder test cases
You can reorder manual test cases in static suites, requirement-based suites, and query-based suites.
Open a test case, and then use the up and down arrows to change the order.

Add existing test cases to a test suite
Add existing test cases to a test suite with the following actions.
Select a test suite. From theNew Test Casemenu, selectAdd existing test cases.
Select a test suite. From theNew Test Casemenu, selectAdd existing test cases.

Add search clauses, as needed, and then selectRun query.
Add search clauses, as needed, and then selectRun query.

When you find the test cases you want, highlight them and selectAdd test cases.
When you find the test cases you want, highlight them and selectAdd test cases.
Tip
You can create a test case that automatically links to a requirementâUser Story (Agile), Product Backlog Item (Scrum), Requirement (CMMI), or Issue (Basic)âwhen you create a test from the board. For more information, seeAdd, run, and update inline tests.
Use the Grid view to edit test cases
Do the following steps to copy and paste test cases into theGridview.
Select theGrid Viewicon.
Select theGrid Viewicon.

Select one to several test cases, and then selectEdit test case(s) in grid.
Select one to several test cases, and then selectEdit test case(s) in grid.

Add, delete, or clear rows.

Optional. To add multiple test cases to the test suite, selectAdd test cases using grid.In theListview, use the column options to select the fields in the test case work item.View and edit these fields when you switch to theGridview.
Optional. To add multiple test cases to the test suite, selectAdd test cases using grid.

In theListview, use the column options to select the fields in the test case work item.

View and edit these fields when you switch to theGridview.
Use Excel to copy information into a Grid view
You can copy test cases and test steps from an existing Excel worksheet.
Copy the columns from Excel that you want to use for the title, action, and expected results fields.
Copying doesn't copy column formatting, other than multiline, from the worksheet.
Paste these columns into theGridview, edit if necessary, and save them.

You can copy the data from theGridview and paste it into your Excel worksheet.
Copying doesn't copy test step formatting, other than multiline, into the worksheet.
Note
Don't use the Teams plugin for Excel to add or update test case work items.
Excel can't parse the format used to store test steps, and in some cases this may affect the formatting of the test case work items.

Assign testers
You can reassign test cases so that a different tester can run them.
You can assign all the test cases in a test suite to multiple testers, which is useful for acceptance testing.
Testers needBasic accessto run tests from Azure Test Plans.
In the context menu for a test suite, selectAssign testers to run all tests.TheSelect testers to run all the tests in suitedialog box opens.
In the context menu for a test suite, selectAssign testers to run all tests.

TheSelect testers to run all the tests in suitedialog box opens.
Add or remove testers from the list. After you select the testers, selectSend emailand edit the message as required so they know that tests are ready for them to run.The email contains a link that testers can open to see the list of assigned tests.

The email contains a link that testers can open to see the list of assigned tests.
You can assign an individual test case to a tester.
In theExecutetab for a test suite, select a test, and then open the context menu.
In theExecutetab for a test suite, select a test, and then open the context menu.

SelectAssign tester. Search for and select a tester.

Manage test cases
You can open a test case to view it or edit it.
To open a test case in a test suite, in theDefinetab, double-select the name of the test case to open.
In theExecutetab, select a test case, open its context menu, and selectEdit test case.

A test case can be linked to test suites, requirements, and bugs.
To see linked items, in theDefinetab, open the context menu for a test case, and selectView Linked Items.

In theLinked Itemsdialog box, you can viewTest Suites,Requirements, andBugs.
Bulk edit test cases
You can edit more than one test case at a time. Select several test cases in a test suite and selectEdit test case(s).

Select aFieldand enter aValue. SelectAdd new fieldto add another field-value pair.
Use tags for test cases
You can tag test cases and view only the ones with specific tags.
For example, tag all the tests related to signing in so that you can rerun these tests if a bug is fixed for that page.
You can filter on that tag from theTest Plansweb portal.
To add new tags to add to work items, have at leastBasicaccess and have the project-levelCreate new tag definition permissionsset toAllow. for more information, seeAdd work item tags.
You can add and edit tags when you edit a test case, or bulk edit tags in theGridview.
You can also create suites based on queries when you use tags.

Rename or remove test cases
You can rename or remove test cases. Open the test case from its context menu.

Here you can rename the test case.

Or you can remove the test case from the test suite. From the context menu for the test case, selectRemove.

To permanently delete test plans and test suites, be a member of the Project Administrators group or have the Area Path node-levelManage test plansorManage test suitespermission set toAllow. To manage or delete test artifacts, you must also have youraccess levelset toBasic + Test PlansorVisual Studio Enterprise. For more information, seeDelete test artifacts in Azure Boards.
