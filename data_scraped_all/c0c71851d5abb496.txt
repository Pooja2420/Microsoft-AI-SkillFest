By default, when a Grafana workspace is created, it comes with a Monitoring Reader role granted on all Azure Monitor data and Log Analytics resources within the subscription.
This means that the new Grafana workspace can access and search all monitoring data in the subscription. It can view the Azure Monitor metrics and logs from all resources, and any logs stored in Log Analytics workspaces in the subscription.
In this article, learn how to manually grant permission for Azure Managed Grafana to access an Azure resource using a managed identity.

az role assignment create --assignee "<assignee>" \
--role "<roleNameOrId>" \
--scope "<scope>"
az role assignment create --assignee "<assignee>" \
--role "<roleNameOrId>" \
--scope "<scope>"
or
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "<assignee>" --assignee-principal-type "<ForeignGroup / Group / ServicePrincipal / User>" \

Example: assigning permission for an Azure Managed Grafana workspace to access an Application Insights resource using a managed identity.
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \
--role "Monitoring Reader" \
--scope "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/my-rg/providers/microsoft.insights/components/myappinsights/"
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \
