Azure Private Linkenables you to access Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resources to your virtual network by using private endpoints. AnAzure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)connects a private endpoint to a set of Azure Monitor resources to define the boundaries of your monitoring network. Using private endpoints for Managed Prometheus/Container Insights and Azure Monitor workspace/Log Analytics Workspace you can allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely ingest data over a Private Link.
This article describes how to configure Container insights and Managed Prometheus to use private link for data ingestion from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
Managed Prometheus (Azure Monitor workspace)
Follow the steps below to set up ingestion of Prometheus metrics from private AKS cluster into Azure Monitor Workspace.
Conceptual overview
A private endpoint is a special network interface for an Azure service in your Virtual Network (VNet). When you create a private endpoint for your Azure Monitor workspace, it provides secure connectivity between clients on your VNet and your workspace. For more information, seePrivate Endpoint.

An Azure Private Link enables you to securely link Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resources to your virtual network by using private endpoints. Azure Monitor uses a single private link connection calledAzure Monitor Private Link Scope or AMPLS, which enables each client in the virtual network to connect with all Azure Monitor resources like Log Analytics Workspace, Azure Monitor Workspace etc. (instead of creating multiple private links). For more information, seeAzure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)

To set up ingestion of Managed Prometheus metrics from virtual network using private endpoints into Azure Monitor Workspace, follow these high-level steps:
Create an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) and connect it with the Data Collection Endpoint of the Azure Monitor Workspace.
Connect the AMPLS to a private endpoint that is set up for the virtual network of your private AKS cluster.
Prerequisites
Aprivate AKS clusterwith Managed Prometheus enabled. As part of Managed Prometheus enablement, you also have an Azure Monitor Workspace that is set up. For more information, seeEnable Managed Prometheus in AKS.
Set up data ingestion from private AKS cluster to Azure Monitor Workspace
1. Create an AMPLS for Azure Monitor Workspace
Metrics collected with Azure Managed Prometheus are ingested and stored in Azure Monitor workspace, so you must make the workspace accessible over a private link. For this, create an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope or AMPLS.
In the Azure portal, search forAzure Monitor Private Link Scopes, then clickCreate.
In the Azure portal, search forAzure Monitor Private Link Scopes, then clickCreate.
Enter the resource group and name, selectPrivate OnlyforIngestion Access Mode.

Click on "Review + Create" to create the AMPLS.
Click on "Review + Create" to create the AMPLS.
For more information on setup of AMPLS, seeConfigure private link for Azure Monitor.
2. Connect the AMPLS to the Data Collection Endpoint of Azure Monitor Workspace
Private links for data ingestion for Managed Prometheus are configured on the Data Collection Endpoints (DCE) of the Azure Monitor workspace that stores the data. To identify the DCEs associated with your Azure Monitor workspace, select Data Collection Endpoints from your Azure Monitor workspace in the Azure portal.
In the Azure portal, search for the Azure Monitor Workspace that you created as part of enabling Managed Prometheus for your private AKS cluster. Note the Data Collection Endpoint name.

2a. Configure DCEs
Note
If your AKS cluster isn't in the same region as your Azure Monitor Workspace, then you need to configure a new Data Collection Endpoint for the Azure Monitor Workspace.
Follow the steps belowonly if your AKS cluster is not in the same region as your Azure Monitor Workspace. If your cluster is in the same region, skip this step and move to step 3.
Create a Data Collection Endpointin the same region as the AKS cluster.
Create a Data Collection Endpointin the same region as the AKS cluster.
Go to your Azure Monitor Workspace, and click on the Data collection rule (DCR) on the Overview page. This DCR has the same name as your Azure Monitor Workspace.

Ingestion from a private AKS cluster
If you choose to use an Azure Firewall to limit the egress from your cluster, you can implement one of the following:
Open a path to the public ingestion endpoint. Update the routing table with the following two endpoints:*.handler.control.monitor.azure.com*.ingest.monitor.azure.com
*.handler.control.monitor.azure.com
*.handler.control.monitor.azure.com
*.ingest.monitor.azure.com
*.ingest.monitor.azure.com
Enable the Azure Firewall to access the Azure Monitor Private Link scope and DCE that's used for data ingestion.
Private link ingestion for remote write
Use the following steps to set up remote write for a Kubernetes cluster over a private link virtual network and an Azure Monitor Private Link scope.
Create your Azure virtual network.
Configure the on-premises cluster to connect to an Azure VNET using a VPN gateway or ExpressRoutes with private-peering.
Create an Azure Monitor Private Link scope.
Connect the Azure Monitor Private Link scope to a private endpoint in the virtual network used by the on-premises cluster. This private endpoint is used to access your DCEs.
From your Azure Monitor workspace in the portal, selectData Collection Endpointsfrom the Azure Monitor workspace menu.
You have at least one DCE which has the same name as your workspace. Click on the DCE to open its details.
Select theNetwork Isolationpage for the DCE.
ClickAddand select your Azure Monitor Private Link scope. It takes a few minutes for the settings to propagate. Once completed, data from your private AKS cluster is ingested into your Azure Monitor workspace over the private link.
Container insights (Log Analytics workspace)
Data for Container insights, is stored in aLog Analytics workspace, so you must make this workspace accessible over a private link.
