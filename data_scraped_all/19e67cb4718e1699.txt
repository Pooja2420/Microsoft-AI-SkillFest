You can also use the plug-in to query and visualize data from Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. For more information, seeConnect Grafana to Azure Monitor Prometheus metrics.
You can then display this performance and availability data on your Grafana dashboard.
Use the following steps to set up a Grafana server and build dashboards for metrics and logs from Azure Monitor.
Set up Grafana
To set up Grafana, follow these steps.
Set up Azure Managed Grafana
Azure Managed Grafana is optimized for the Azure environment and works seamlessly with Azure Monitor. You can:
Manage user authentication and access control by using Microsoft Entra identities.
Pin charts from the Azure portal directly to Azure Managed Grafana dashboards.
Use thisquickstart guideto create an Azure Managed Grafana workspace by using the Azure portal.
Set up Grafana locally
To set up a local Grafana server,download and install Grafana in your local environment.
Sign in to Grafana
Important
Internet Explorer and the older Microsoft Edge browsers aren't compatible with Grafana. You must use a chromium-based browser including Microsoft Edge. For more information, seeSupported web browsers for Grafana.
Sign in to Grafana by using the endpoint URL of your Azure Managed Grafana workspace or your server's IP address.
Configure an Azure Monitor data source plug-in
Azure Managed Grafana includes an Azure Monitor data source plug-in. By default, the plug-in is preconfigured with a managed identity that can query and visualize monitoring data from all resources in the subscription in which the Grafana workspace was deployed. Skip ahead to the section "Build a Grafana dashboard."

You can expand the resources that can be viewed by your Azure Managed Grafana workspace byconfiguring additional permissionsto assign the included managed identity theMonitoring Reader roleon other subscriptions or resources.
If you're using an instance that isn't Azure Managed Grafana, you have to set up an Azure Monitor data source.
SelectAdd data source, filter by the nameAzure, and select theAzure Monitordata source.
SelectAdd data source, filter by the nameAzure, and select theAzure Monitordata source.

Pick a name for the data source and choose between managed identity or app registration for authentication.
Pick a name for the data source and choose between managed identity or app registration for authentication.
If you're hosting Grafana on your own Azure Virtual Machines or Azure App Service instance with managed identity enabled, you can use this approach for authentication. However, if your Grafana instance isn't hosted on Azure or doesn't have managed identity enabled, you need to use app registration with an Azure service principal to set up authentication.
Use managed identity
Enable managed identity on your VM or App Service instance and change the Grafana server managed identity support setting totrue.The managed identity of your hosting VM or App Service instance needs to have theMonitoring Reader roleassigned for the subscription, resource group, or resources of interest.You also need to update the settingmanaged_identity_enabled = truein the Grafana server config. For more information, seeGrafana configuration. After both steps are finished, you can then save and test access.

Use app registration
Create a service principal. Grafana uses a Microsoft Entra service principal to connect to Azure Monitor APIs and collect data. You must create, or use an existing service principal, to manage access to your Azure resources:SeeCreate a Microsoft Entra app and service principal in the portalto create a service principal. Copy and save your tenant ID (Directory ID), client ID (Application ID), and client secret (Application key value).ViewAssign application to roleto assign theMonitoring Reader roleto the Microsoft Entra application on the subscription, resource group, or resource you want to monitor.

Use out-of-the-box dashboards
Azure Monitor contains out-of-the-box dashboards to use with Azure Managed Grafana and the Azure Monitor plugin. You can find a list of all available dashboards onGrafana Labs.

Azure Monitor also supports out-of-the-box dashboards for seamless integration with Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. These dashboards are automatically deployed to Azure Managed Grafana when linked to Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus.

Build a Grafana dashboard
Go to the Grafana home page and selectNew Dashboard.
Go to the Grafana home page and selectNew Dashboard.
In the new dashboard, selectAdd visualizationand choose theAzure Monitordata source. You can try other charting options, but this article usesTime seriesas an example.

Editthe panel to configure your query.Visualize Azure Monitor metric data: A list of selectors shows up where you can select the service and resource to monitor in this chart. To view metrics from a VM, leave the defaultMetricsselection, selectResourceto choose a VM, use the dropdowns provided to choose the namespace, metric, and aggregation. After you select VM and metrics, you can start viewing the data in the dashboard.Visualize Azure Monitor log data: SelectLogsin the service dropdown list. Select the resource or workspace you want to query, toggle theTime RangetoDashboardand set the query text. You can copy here any log query you already have or create a new one. As you enter your query, IntelliSense suggests autocomplete options. Select the visualization type,Time series>Table, and run the query.NoteThe plugin can also use time macros such as$__timeFilter()and$__interval.
These macros allow Grafana to dynamically calculate the time range and time grain, when you zoom in on part of a chart. You can remove these macros and use a standard time filter, such asTimeGenerated > ago(1h), but that means the graph wouldn't support the zoom-in feature.

Pin charts from the Azure portal to Azure Managed Grafana
In addition to building your panels in Grafana, you can also quickly pin Azure Monitor visualizations from the Azure portal to new or existing Grafana dashboards by adding panels to your Grafana dashboard directly from Azure Monitor. Go toMetricsfor your resource. Create a chart and selectSave to dashboard, followed byPin to Grafana. Choose the workspace and dashboard and selectPinto complete the operation.

Features supported with Grafana 11
Azure Managed Grafana includes support for Grafana 11 (preview), which introduces capabilities for basic logs and usingexemplarswith Azure.
Prerequisites

Basic logs
Basic Logs provide a cost-effective way to manage data storage by allowing you to switch between different table plans based on data usage, seeSelect a table plan based on data usage in a Log Analytics workspace.
In Grafana, go toConnections>Data sources>Azure Monitor.
On theSettingstab, toggle theEnable Basic Logsswitch to the right (blue isOn).

Create a new dashboard.
Below the empty graph, under(Azure Monitor), switchServicetoLogs.
ForResource, select a Log Analytics workspace.
You can now switch Logs fromAnalyticstoBasic.

Note
Switching to Basic Logs comes with limitations:
Time rangewill beDashboardtime. SwitchingTime rangeback toQueryis not available.
Basic logs incur per-query costs, seeSelect a table plan based on data usage in a Log Analytics workspace.
Advanced Grafana features
Grafana offers advanced features:
Azure Monitor plugin variables -Azure Monitor template variables | Grafana documentation
Dashboard playlists -Manage playlists | Grafana Cloud documentation
Optional: Monitor other datasources in the same Grafana dashboards
There are many data source plug-ins that you can use to bring these metrics together in a dashboard.
Here are good reference articles on how to use Telegraf, InfluxDB, Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus, and Docker:

Here's an image of a full Grafana dashboard that has metrics from Azure Monitor metrics, logs, and traces combined.

Clean up resources
If you set up a Grafana environment on Azure, you're charged when resources are running whether you're using them or not. To avoid incurring additional charges, clean up the resource group created in this article.
On the left menu in the Azure portal, selectResource groups>Grafana.
On your resource group page, selectDelete, enterGrafanain the text box, and then selectDelete.
