In this article, we'll walk through enabling the kdump service on Azure HANA Large
Instances (HLI)Type I and Type II.
Configuring and enabling kdump is needed to troubleshoot system crashes that don't have a clear cause. Sometimes a system crash cannot be explained by a hardware or infrastructure problem. In such cases, an operating system or application may have caused the problem. kdump will allow SUSE to determine the reason for the system crash.
Supported SKUs
Prerequisites
The kdump service uses the/var/crashdirectory to write dumps. Make sure the partition corresponding to this directory has sufficient space to accommodate dumps.
/var/crash
Setup details
The script to enable kdump can be found in theAzure sap-hana-tools on GitHub
Note
This script is made based on our lab setup. You will need to contact your OS vendor for any further tuning.
A separate logical unit number (LUN) will be provisioned for new and existing servers for saving the dumps. A script will take care of configuring the file system out of the LUN.
Microsoft won't be responsible for analyzing the dump. You will need to open a ticket with your OS vendor to have it analyzed.
Run this script on your HANA Large Instance by using the following command:NoteSudo privileges are needed to run this command.sudo bash enable-kdump.sh

If the command's output shows kdump is successfully enabled, reboot the system to apply the changes.

Test kdump
Note
The following operation will trigger a kernel crash and system reboot.
Trigger a kernel crashecho c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
Trigger a kernel crash
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
After the system reboots successfully, check the/var/crashdirectory for kernel crash logs.
