In this tutorial, you configure a Linux virtual machine (VM) to forward Syslog data to your workspace by using Azure Monitor Agent. These steps allow you to collect and monitor data from Linux-based devices where you can't install an agent like a firewall network device.
Note
Container Insights now supports the automatic collection of Syslog events from Linux nodes in your AKS clusters. To learn more, seeSyslog collection with Container Insights.
Configure your Linux-based device to send data to a Linux VM. Azure Monitor Agent on the VM forwards the Syslog data to the Log Analytics workspace. Then use Microsoft Sentinel or Azure Monitor to monitor the device from the data stored in the Log Analytics workspace.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a data collection rule.
Verify that Azure Monitor Agent is running.
Enable log reception on port 514.
Verify that Syslog data is forwarded to your Log Analytics workspace.
Prerequisites
To complete the steps in this tutorial, you must have the following resources and roles:

Verify that Azure Monitor Agent is running
In Microsoft Sentinel or Azure Monitor, verify that Azure Monitor Agent is running on your VM.
In the Azure portal, search for and openMicrosoft SentinelorAzure Monitor.

Enable log reception on port 514
Verify that the VM that's collecting the log data allows reception on port 514 TCP or UDP depending on the Syslog source. Then configure the built-in Linux Syslog daemon on the VM to listen for Syslog messages from your devices. After you finish those steps, configure your Linux-based device to send logs to your VM.
Note
If the firewall is running, a rule will need to be created to allow remote systems to reach the daemonâs syslog listener:systemctl status firewalld.service
systemctl status firewalld.service
Add for tcp 514 (your zone/port/protocol may differ depending on your scenario)firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=514/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=514/tcp --permanent
Add for udp 514 (your zone/port/protocol may differ depending on your scenario)firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=514/udp --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=514/udp --permanent
Restart the firewall service to ensure new rules take effectsystemctl restart firewalld.service
systemctl restart firewalld.service
The following two sections cover how to add an inbound port rule for an Azure VM and configure the built-in Linux Syslog daemon.
Allow inbound Syslog traffic on the VM
If you're forwarding Syslog data to an Azure VM, follow these steps to allow reception on port 514.

Configure the Linux Syslog daemon
Connect to your Linux VM and configure the Linux Syslog daemon. For example, run the following command, adapting the command as needed for your network environment:
sudo wget -O Forwarder_AMA_installer.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/Syslog/Forwarder_AMA_installer.py&&sudo python3 Forwarder_AMA_installer.py
sudo wget -O Forwarder_AMA_installer.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/Syslog/Forwarder_AMA_installer.py&&sudo python3 Forwarder_AMA_installer.py
This script can make changes for both rsyslog.d and syslog-ng.
Note
To avoidFull Disk scenarioswhere the agent can't function, you must set thesyslog-ngorrsyslogconfiguration to not store logs, which are not needed by the agent. A Full Disk scenario disrupts the function of the installed Azure Monitor Agent.

Verify Syslog data is forwarded to your Log Analytics workspace
After you configure your Linux-based device to send logs to your VM, verify that Azure Monitor Agent is forwarding Syslog data to your workspace.
In the Azure portal, search for and openMicrosoft SentinelorAzure Monitor.

Clean up resources
Evaluate whether you need the resources like the VM that you created. Resources you leave running can cost you money. Delete the resources you don't need individually. You can also delete the resource group to delete all the resources you created.
