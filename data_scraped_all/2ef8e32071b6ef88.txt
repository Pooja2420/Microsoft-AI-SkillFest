Warning
Virtual Network Injection will be retired for Azure Data Explorer by 1 February 2025. For more information on the deprecation, seeDeprecation of Virtual Network Injection for Azure Data Explorer.
This article explains the resources that are present when you deploy an Azure Data Explorer cluster into a custom Azure Virtual Network. This information will help you deploy a cluster into a subnet in your Virtual Network (VNet). For more information on Azure Virtual Networks, seeWhat is Azure Virtual Network?

Azure Data Explorer supports deploying a cluster into a subnet in your Virtual Network (VNet). This capability enables you to:
EnforceNetwork Security Group(NSG) rules on your Azure Data Explorer cluster traffic.
Connect your on-premises network to Azure Data Explorer cluster's subnet.
Secure your data connection sources (Event HubsandEvent Grid) withservice endpoints.
Access your Azure Data Explorer cluster in your virtual network
You can access your Azure Data Explorer cluster using the following IP addresses for each service (engine and data management services):
Private IP: Used for accessing the cluster inside the virtual network.
Public IP: Used for accessing the cluster from outside the virtual network for management and monitoring, and as a source address for outbound connections started from the cluster.
Important
The default NSG rules block access to public IP addresses outside the virtual network. To reach a public endpoint, you must add an exception for your public IP addresses in the NSG.
The following DNS records are created to access the service:
[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(engine)ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(data management) are mapped to the public IP for each service.
[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(engine)ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(data management) are mapped to the public IP for each service.
[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net
ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net
private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(engine)ingest-private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net\private-ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(data management) are mapped to the private IP for each service.
private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(engine)ingest-private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net\private-ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net(data management) are mapped to the private IP for each service.
private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net
ingest-private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net
private-ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net
Plan subnet size in your virtual network
The size of the subnet used to host an Azure Data Explorer cluster can't be altered after the subnet is deployed. In your virtual network, Azure Data Explorer uses one private IP address for each VM and two private IP addresses for the internal load balancers (engine and data management). Azure networking also uses five IP addresses for each subnet. Azure Data Explorer provisions two VMs for the data management service. Engine service VMs are provisioned per user configuration scale capacity.
The total number of IP addresses:
Important
Make sure that you plan the subnet size before deploying Azure Data Explorer. Once deployed, the subnet size cannot be changed.
Make sure that you don't deploy any other Azure resources or services in the Subnet where you plan to deploy Azure Data Explorer. Doing so will prevent Azure Data Explorer starting when resuming from a suspended state.
Service endpoints for connecting to Azure Data Explorer
Azure Service Endpointsenables you to secure your Azure multitenant resources to your virtual network.
Deploying the cluster into your subnet allows you to set up data connections withEvent HubsorEvent Gridwhile restricting the underlying resources for Azure Data Explorer subnet.
Private Endpoints
Private Endpointsallow private access to Azure resources (such asstorage/event hub/Data Lake Gen 2), and use private IP from your Virtual Network, effectively bringing the resource into your virtual network.
Create aprivate endpointto resources used by data connections, such as event hub and storage, and external tables such as Storage, Data Lake Gen 2, and SQL Database from your virtual network to access the underlying resources privately.
Note
Setting up Private Endpoint requiresconfiguring DNS, We supportAzure Private DNS zonesetup only. Custom DNS server isn't supported.
Configure Network Security Group rules
NSGsgive you the ability to control network access within a virtual network. You must configure NSGs for your Azure Data Explorer cluster to work in your virtual network.
Configure Network Security Group rules using subnet delegation
Subnet delegationis the default method for configuring Network Security Group rules for Azure Data Explorer clusters deployed into a subnet in your virtual network. When using subnet delegation, you must delegate the subnet toMicrosoft.Kusto/clustersbefore creating the cluster in the subnet.
By enabling subnet delegation on the cluster's subnet, you enable the service to define its pre-conditions for deployment in the form of Network Intent Policies. When creating the cluster in the subnet, the NSG configurations mentioned in the following sections are automatically created for you.
Warning
Changing your subnet delegation configuration will eventually disrupt the normal operation of your cluster. For example, after stopping the cluster you may not be able to start your cluster, run management commands, or apply health monitoring on your cluster.
Configure Network Security Group rules manually
Alternatively, you can manually configure your NSG. By default, deploying a cluster into a virtual network enforces subnet delegation for "Microsoft.Kusto/clusters" to be configured. Opting out of this requirement is possible using thePreview featurespane.
Warning
Manually configuring NSG rules for your cluster is not trivial and requires you to constantly monitor this article for changes. We highly recommended using subnet delegation for your cluster or, if you prefer, consider using aPrivate Endpointbased solution.

The following sections list the relevant IP addresses for management and health monitoring.
Note
You can disregard the following lists if your subnet is delegated toMicrosoft.Kusto/clustersas described inConfigure Network Security Group rules using subnet delegation. In this scenario, IP addresses may be not be up to date but will be automatically updated when the required NSG rules are assigned to the cluster.
Note
For future deployments, use AzureDataExplorer Service Tag
ExpressRoute setup
Use ExpressRoute to connect on premises network to the Azure Virtual Network. A common setup is to advertise the default route (0.0.0.0/0) through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session. This forces traffic coming out of the Virtual Network to be forwarded to the customer's premise network that may drop the traffic, causing outbound flows to break. To overcome this default,User Defined Route (UDR)(0.0.0.0/0) can be configured and next hop will beInternet. Since the UDR takes precedence over BGP, the traffic will be destined to the Internet.
Securing outbound traffic with a firewall
If you want to secure outbound traffic usingAzure Firewallor any virtual appliance to limit domain names, the following Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) must be allowed in the firewall.

Configure the route table
You must configure theroute tableof your cluster's subnet with next hopInternetto prevent asymmetric routes issues.
We recommend using subnet delegation to configure the route table for your cluster's deployment, similarly to how it was done forNSG rules. By enabling subnet delegation on the cluster's subnet, you enable the service to configure and update the route table for you.
Alternatively, you can manually configure the route table. By default, deploying a cluster into a virtual network enforces subnet delegation for "Microsoft.Kusto/clusters" to be configured. Opting out of this requirement is possible using thePreview featurespane.

How to discover dependencies automatically
Azure Data Explorer provides an API that allows customers to discover all external outbound dependencies (FQDNs) programmatically.
These outbound dependencies will allow customers to set up a Firewall at their end to allow management traffic through the dependent FQDNs. Customers can have these firewall appliances either in Azure or on-premises. The latter might cause additional latency and might impact the service performance. Service teams will need to test out this scenario to evaluate impact on the service performance.

The outbound dependencies cover categories such asMicrosoft Entra ID,Azure Monitor,Certificate Authority,Azure Storage, andInternal Tracing. In each category, there's a list of domain names and ports that are needed to run the service. They can be used to programmatically configure the firewall appliance of choice.
Deploy Azure Data Explorer cluster into your virtual network using an Azure Resource Manager template
To deploy Azure Data Explorer cluster into your virtual network, use theDeploy Azure Data Explorer cluster into your virtual networkAzure Resource Manager template.
This template creates the cluster, virtual network, subnet, network security group, and public IP addresses.
Known limitations
Virtual network resources with deployed clusters don't support themove to a new resource group or subscriptionoperation.
Public IP address resources used for the cluster engine or the data management service don't support the move to a new resource group or subscription operation.
It's not possible to use the "private-" DNS prefix of virtual network injected Azure Data Explorer clusters as part of your query
