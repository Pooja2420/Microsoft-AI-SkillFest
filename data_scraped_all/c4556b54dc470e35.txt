Azure Load Balancer allows you to load balance services on multiple frontend IPs. You can use a public or internal load balancer to load balance traffic across a set of services like virtual machine scale sets or virtual machines (VMs).
This article describes the fundamentals of load balancing across multiple frontend IP addresses. If you only intend to expose services on one IP address, you can find simplified instructions forpublicorinternalload balancer configurations. Adding multiple frontends is incremental to a single frontend configuration. Using the concepts in this article, you can expand a simplified configuration at any time.
When you define an Azure Load Balancer, a frontend and a backend pool configuration are connected with a load balancing rule. The health probe referenced by the load balancing rule is used to determine the health of a VM on a certain port and protocol. Based on the health probe results, new flows are sent to VMs in the backend pool. The frontend is defined using a three-tuple comprised of a frontend IP address (public or internal), a protocol, and a port number from the load balancing rule. The backend pool is a collection of Virtual Machine IP configurations. Load balancing rules can deliver traffic to the same backend pool instance on different ports. This is done by varying the destination port on the load balancing rule.
You can use multiple frontends (and the associated load balancing rules) to load balance to the same backend port or a different backend port. If you want to load balance to the same backend port, you must enableAzure Load Balancer Floating IP configurationas part of the load balancing rules for each frontend.
Add Load Balancer frontend
In this example, add another frontend to your Load Balancer.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterLoad balancer. SelectLoad balancersin the search results.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterLoad balancer. SelectLoad balancersin the search results.
SelectmyLoadBalanceror your load balancer.
SelectmyLoadBalanceror your load balancer.
In the load balancer page, selectFrontend IP configurationinSettings.
In the load balancer page, selectFrontend IP configurationinSettings.

Enter or select the following information inAdd frontend IP configuration.

You can also select a specific zone.
Enter or select the following information inAdd frontend IP configuration.

SelectSave.
SelectSave.
Next you must associate the frontend IP configuration you have created with an appropriate load balancing rule. Refer toManage rules for Azure Load Balancerfor more information on how to do this.
Remove a frontend
In this example, you remove a frontend from your Load Balancer.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

SelectDelete.
Limitations
There is a limit on the number of frontends you can add to a Load Balancer. For more information, review the Load Balancer section of theService limitsdocument for details.
Public IP addresses have a charge associated with them. For more information, seeIP Address pricing
