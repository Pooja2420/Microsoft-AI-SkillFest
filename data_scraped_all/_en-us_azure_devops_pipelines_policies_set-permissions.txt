Permissions for build and release pipelines are primarily set at the object-level for a specific build or release, or for select tasks, at the collection level.
You can manage security for different types of resources such as variable groups, secure files, and deployment groups by granting permissions to that resource to users or groups. Project administrators can manage access to project resources. If you want to allow a team member to edit pipelines, you must be a project administrator in order to do so.

Verify permissions for contributors
Note
A security best practice is to only grant permissions to required users or groups. TheContributorsgroup may be too broad in a given project.
To verify the permissions for your project's contributors, make sure you're a member of theBuild Administratorsgroup or theProject Administratorsgroup. For more information, seeChange project-level permissions.
From within your project, selectPipelines>Pipelines. Select theAlltab, and then select the more actions menu thanManage security.
