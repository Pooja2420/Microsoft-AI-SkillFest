Azure Backup provides a set of built-in metrics via Azure Monitor that enable you to monitor the health of your backups. It also allows you to configure alert rules that trigger when the metrics exceed defined thresholds.
Azure Backup offers the following key capabilities:
Ability to view out-of-the-box metrics related to back up and restore health of your backup items along with associated trends
Ability to write custom alert rules on these metrics to efficiently monitor the health of your backup items
Ability to route fired metric alerts to different notification channels supported by Azure Monitor, such as email, ITSM, webhook, logic apps, and so on.
Learn more about Azure Monitor metrics.
Supported scenarios
Supports built-in metrics for the following workload types:Azure VM, SQL databases in Azure VMSAP HANA databases in Azure VMAzure FilesAzure Blobs.Metrics for HANA instance workload type are currently not supported.
Supports built-in metrics for the following workload types:
Azure VM, SQL databases in Azure VM
SAP HANA databases in Azure VM
Azure Files
Azure Blobs.
Metrics for HANA instance workload type are currently not supported.
Metrics can be viewed for all Recovery Services vaults in each region and subscription at a time. Viewing metrics for a larger scope in the Azure portal is currently not supported. The same limits are also applicable to configure metric alert rules.

Supported metrics
Currently, Azure Backup supports the following metrics:
Backup Health Events: The value of this metric represents the count of health events pertaining to backup job health, which were fired for the vault within a specific time. When a backup job completes, the Azure Backup service creates a backup health event. Based on the job status (such as succeeded or failed), the dimensions associated with the event vary.
Backup Health Events: The value of this metric represents the count of health events pertaining to backup job health, which were fired for the vault within a specific time. When a backup job completes, the Azure Backup service creates a backup health event. Based on the job status (such as succeeded or failed), the dimensions associated with the event vary.
Restore Health Events: The value of this metric represents the count of health events pertaining to restore job health, which were fired for the vault within a specific time. When a restore job completes, the Azure Backup service creates a restore health event. Based on the job status (such as succeeded or failed), the dimensions associated with the event vary.
Restore Health Events: The value of this metric represents the count of health events pertaining to restore job health, which were fired for the vault within a specific time. When a restore job completes, the Azure Backup service creates a restore health event. Based on the job status (such as succeeded or failed), the dimensions associated with the event vary.
Note
We support Restore Health Events only for Azure Blobs workload, as backups are continuous, and there's no notion of backup jobs here.
By default, the counts are surfaced at the vault level. To view the counts for a particular backup item and job status, you can filter the metrics on any of the supported dimensions.
The following table lists the dimensions that Backup Health Events and Restore Health Events metrics supports:
For Azure resources, such as VMs and Files, this contains the Azure Resource Manager ID (ARM ID) of the resource.For example,/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testVM
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testVM
For SQL/HANA databases inside VMs, this contains the ARM ID of the VM followed by details of the database.For example,/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testVM/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/backupProtectedItem/SQLDataBase;mssqlserver;msdb

Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines (Azure Virtual Machines)
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/fileServices/shares (Azure Files)
SQLDatabase (SQL in Azure VM)
SAPHANADataBase (SAP HANA in Azure VM)
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/testVault/backupFabrics/Azure/protectionContainers/IaasVMContainer;iaasvmcontainerv2;testRG;testVM/protectedItems/VM;iaasvmcontainerv2;testRG;testVM

When a backup/restore job is successful, a health event with statusHealthyappears.
Unhealthyappears to job failures due to service errors, andDegradedappears to failures due to user errors.
When the same error happens for the same backup item repeatedly, the state changes fromTransient Unhealthy/DegradedtoPersistent Unhealthy/Degraded.
View metrics in the Azure portal
To view metrics in the Azure portal, follow the below steps:
In theAzure portal, go to theBusiness Continuity Center>Monitoring + Reporting>Metrics.Alternatively, you can go to theRecovery Services vaultorAzure Monitor, and selectMetrics.

To filter metrics by different dimensions, click theAdd Filterbutton and select the relevant dimension values.For example, if you wish to see health event counts only for Azure VM backups, add a filterDatasource Type = Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines.To view health events for a particular datasource or backup instance within the vault, use the datasource ID/backup instance ID filters.To view health events only for failed backups, use a filter on HealthStatus, by selecting the values corresponding to unhealthy or degraded health state.

To view health events only for failed backups, use a filter on HealthStatus, by selecting the values corresponding to unhealthy or degraded health state.

Manage Alerts
To view your fired metric alerts, follow these steps:
In theAzure portal, go to theBusiness Continuity Center>Monitoring + Reporting>Alerts.
Filtering forSignal Type=MetricandAlert Type=Configured.
Click an alert to view more details about the alert and change its state.
Note
The alert has two fields -Monitor condition (fired/resolved)andAlert State (New/Ack/Closed).
Alert state: You can edit this field (as shown in below screenshot).
Monitor condition: You can't edit this field. This field is used more in scenarios where the service itself resolves the alert. For example, auto-resolution behavior in metric alerts uses theMonitor conditionfield to resolve an alert.
Based on the alert rules configuration, the fired alert appears on theAlertsblade in theBusiness Continuity Center.
Learn how to view and filter alerts.
Note
Currently, in case of blob restore alerts, alerts appear under datasource alerts only if you select both the dimensions -datasourceIdanddatasourceTypewhile creating the alert rule. If any dimensions aren't selected, the alerts appear under global alerts.
Accessing metrics programmatically
You can use the different programmatic clients, such as PowerShell, CLI, or REST API, to access the metrics functionality. SeeAzure Monitor REST API documentationfor more details.
Sample alert scenarios
Alert Rule: Fire an alert if Backup Health Events < 1 in last 24 hours for:
Dimensions["HealthStatus"] != "Healthy"
Alert Rule: Fire an alert if Backup Health Events > 0 in last 5 minutes for:
Dimensions["HealthStatus"]!= "Healthy"
Dimensions["DatasourceId"]= "All current and future values"
Alert Rule: Fire an alert if Backup Health Events > 1 in last 24 hours for:
Dimensions["HealthStatus"]!= "Healthy"
Dimensions["DatasourceId"]= "All current and future values"
Alert Rule: Fire an alert if Backup Health Events < 1 in the last 24 hours for:
Dimensions["DatasourceId"]= "All current and future values"
