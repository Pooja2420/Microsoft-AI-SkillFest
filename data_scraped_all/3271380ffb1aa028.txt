This article walks you through the steps to configure settings on the FHIRÂ® service forimportoperations. To configure settings, you need to:
import
Enable a managed identity on the FHIR service.
Create an Azure storage account or use an existing storage account, and grant permissions for the FHIR service to access it.
Set the import configuration of the FHIR service.
Use one of the options to securely import FHIR data into the FHIR service from an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
Step 1: Enable a managed identity on the FHIR service
The first step is to enable a system-wide managed identity on the service. This identity is used to grant FHIR service access to the storage account. For more information about managed identities in Azure, seeAbout managed identities for Azure resources.
To enable a managed identity on the FHIR service:
In the Azure portal, browse to your FHIR service.
On the left menu, selectIdentity.
Set theStatusoption toOn, and then selectSave.
SelectYes.
After you enable the managed identity, a system-assigned GUID value appears.

Step 2: Assign permissions to the FHIR service
Use the following steps to assign permissions to access the storage account.
In the storage account, browse toAccess Control (IAM).
In the storage account, browse toAccess Control (IAM).
SelectAdd role assignment. If the option for adding a role assignment is unavailable, ask your Azure administrator to assign you permission to perform this step.For more information about assigning roles in the Azure portal, seeAzure built-in roles.
SelectAdd role assignment. If the option for adding a role assignment is unavailable, ask your Azure administrator to assign you permission to perform this step.
For more information about assigning roles in the Azure portal, seeAzure built-in roles.
Add theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the FHIR service.
Add theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the FHIR service.
SelectSave.
SelectSave.

Now you're ready to select the storage account for import.
Step 3: Set the import configuration of the FHIR service
Note
If you haven't assigned storage access permissions to the FHIR service, theimportoperation will fail.
import
For this step, you need to get the request URL and JSON body.
In the Azure portal, browse to your FHIR service.
SelectOverview.
SelectJSON View.
Select the API version as2022-06-01or later.
To specify the Azure storage account in JSON view which is inREADmode, you need to use theREST APIto update the FHIR service.

The following steps walk you through setting configurations for initial and incremental import modes. Choose the right import mode for your use case.
Set the import configuration for initial import mode
Make the following changes to JSON.
InimportConfiguration, setenabledtotrue.
importConfiguration
enabled
true
UpdateintegrationDataStorewith the target storage account name.
integrationDataStore
InimportConfiguration, setinitialImportModetotrue.
importConfiguration
initialImportMode
true
Delete theprovisioningStateline.
provisioningState

You're now ready to perform initial-mode import by usingimport.
import
Set the import configuration for incremental import mode
Make the following changes to JSON.
InimportConfiguration, setenabledtotrue.
importConfiguration
enabled
true
UpdateintegrationDataStorewith the target storage account name.

InimportConfiguration, setinitialImportModetofalse.

false
Delete theprovisioningStateline.

You're now ready to perform incremental-mode import by usingimport.

You can also use theDeploy to Azurebutton to open a custom Azure Resource Manager template that updates the configuration forimport.

Step 4: Secure the FHIR service's import operation
To securely import FHIR data into the FHIR service from an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account, you have three options:
Enable the FHIR service as a trusted Microsoft service.
Allow specific IP addresses associated with the FHIR service to access the storage account from other Azure regions.
Allow specific IP addresses associated with the FHIR service to access the storage account in the same region as the FHIR service.
Enable the FHIR service as a trusted Microsoft service
In the Azure portal, go to your Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
In the Azure portal, go to your Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
On the left menu, selectNetworking.
On the left menu, selectNetworking.
On theFirewalls and virtual networkstab, selectEnabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses.

Use the following PowerShell command to set the selected FHIR service instance as a trusted resource for the storage account. Make sure that all listed parameters are defined in your PowerShell environment.You need to run theAdd-AzStorageAccountNetworkRulecommand as an administrator in your local environment.

You're now ready to securely import FHIR data from the storage account. The storage account is on selected networks and isn't publicly accessible. To securely access the files, you can useprivate endpointsfor the storage account.
Allow specific IP addresses to access the Azure storage account from other Azure regions
In the Azure portal, go to the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.

In theFirewallsection, in theAddress rangebox, specify the IP address. Add IP ranges to allow access from the internet or your on-premises networks. You can find the IP address in the following table for the Azure region where the FHIR service is provisioned.Azure regionPublic IP addressAustralia East20.53.44.80Canada Central20.48.192.84Central US52.182.208.31East US20.62.128.148East US 220.49.102.228East US 2 EUAP20.39.26.254Germany North51.116.51.33Germany West Central51.116.146.216Japan East20.191.160.26Korea Central20.41.69.51North Central US20.49.114.188North Europe52.146.131.52South Africa North102.133.220.197South Central US13.73.254.220Southeast Asia23.98.108.42Switzerland North51.107.60.95UK South51.104.30.170UK West51.137.164.94West Central US52.150.156.44West Europe20.61.98.66West US 240.64.135.77
In theFirewallsection, in theAddress rangebox, specify the IP address. Add IP ranges to allow access from the internet or your on-premises networks. You can find the IP address in the following table for the Azure region where the FHIR service is provisioned.
Allow specific IP addresses to access the Azure storage account in the same region
The configuration process for IP addresses in the same region is just like the previous procedure, except that you use a specific IP address range in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format instead (that is, 100.64.0.0/10). You must specify the IP address range (100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255) because an IP address for the FHIR service is allocated each time you make an operation request.
Note
It's possible to use a private IP address within the range of 10.0.2.0/24, but there's no guarantee that the operation will succeed in such a case. You can retry if the operation request fails, but until you use an IP address within the range of 100.64.0.0/10, the request won't succeed.
This network behavior for IP address ranges is by design. The alternative is to configure the storage account in a different region.
