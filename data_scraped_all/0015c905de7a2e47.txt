This article shows you how to securely and seamlessly create an SSH connection to your Linux VMs located in an Azure virtual network directly through the Azure portal. When you use Azure Bastion, your VMs don't require a client, agent, or additional software.
Azure Bastion provides secure connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network in which it's provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH. For more information, see theWhat is Azure Bastion?article.
When connecting to a Linux virtual machine using SSH, you can use both username/password and SSH keys for authentication.
Prerequisites
Make sure that you have set up an Azure Bastion host for the virtual network in which the VM resides. For more information, seeCreate an Azure Bastion host. Once the Bastion service is provisioned and deployed in your virtual network, you can use it to connect to any VM in this virtual network.
The connection settings and features that are available depend on the Bastion SKU you're using. Make sure your Bastion deployment is using the required SKU.
To see the available features and settings per SKU tier, see theSKUs and featuressection of the Bastion overview article.
To check the SKU tier of your Bastion deployment and upgrade if necessary, seeUpgrade a Bastion SKU.
Required roles
In order to make a connection, the following roles are required:
Reader role on the virtual machine.
Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.
Reader role on the virtual network of the target virtual machine (if the Bastion deployment is in a peered virtual network).
Ports
In order to connect to the Linux VM via SSH, you must have the following ports open on your VM:
Inbound port: SSH (22)or
Inbound port: Custom value (you'll then need to specify this custom port when you connect to the VM via Azure Bastion). This setting isn't available for the Basic or Developer SKU.
Bastion connection page
In the Azure portal, go to the virtual machine to which you want to connect. At the top of the virtual machineOverviewpage, selectConnect, then selectConnect via Bastionfrom the dropdown. This opens theBastionpage. You can go to the Bastion page directly in the left pane.

Microsoft Entra ID authentication
Note
Microsoft Entra ID Authentication support for SSH connections within the portal is only supported for Linux VMs.
If  the following prerequisites are met, Microsoft Entra ID becomes the default option to connect to your VM. If not, Microsoft Entra ID won't appear as an option.
Prerequisites:
Microsoft Entra ID Login should be enabled on the VM. Microsoft Entra ID Login can be enabled during VM creation or by adding theMicrosoft Entra ID Loginextension to a pre-existing VM.
