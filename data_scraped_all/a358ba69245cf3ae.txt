This article shows you how to set up alerts in Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pools, using the Azure portal. Alerts can send you an email or call a web hook when some metric (for example database size or CPU usage) reaches the threshold.
Set up new alert rule
You can receive an alert based on monitoring metrics for, or events on, your Azure services.
Metric values- The alert triggers when the value of a specified metric crosses a threshold you assign. For more information, seeMetric alerts.
Activity log events- An alert can trigger oneveryevent, or, only when a certain number of events occur. For more information, seeActivity log alerts.
Resource health- An alert related to the resource health status events, including whether the event was platform or user-initiated. For more information, seeResource health alerts.
You can configure many action types for an alert to perform when it triggers, including:
Send email notifications to the service administrator and coadministrators
Send email to additional emails that you specify, including for an Azure Resource Manager Role.
Call a phone number with voice prompt
Send text message to a phone number
Send an Azure mobile app notification
Start an automation runbook
Call an Azure Function
Start an Event Hubs action
Create an ITSM-compatible ticket
Select a logic app action
Call a webhook or a secure webhook
You can configure and get information about alert rules using:
Azure portal, as detailed in this article.
PowerShell
Command-line interface (CLI)
ARM template
Azure Monitor REST API
Get started with a new alert rule in the Azure portal
In theAzure portal, locate the resource you are interested in monitoring and select it.
In the resource menu underMonitoring, selectAlerts. The text and icon might vary slightly for different resources.
Select the+ Createbutton, thenAlert rule.
On theCreate an alert rulepage, theScopeis automatically configured to the individual resource.NoteTo avoid sprawl of many independent alerts, you may want to configure alerts for all resources of a type in a subscription, resource group, or an Azure SQL Database logical server. Use theScopetab to change the scope of the new alert rule.

Activity log
Capture activity peaks or sustained resource stress with alerts on theMetricssignal category.
On theConditiontab, selectSee all signalsandSelect a signalfrom the list ofMetrics.

Select the desired metric, for exampleCPU percentage. SelectApply.
Select the desired metric, for exampleCPU percentage. SelectApply.
After you select a signal, theAlert logicoptions appear. A preview of recent activity in this resource for that signal is also displayed.

Configure aThresholdtype to determine when the alert will take action. ChooseAggregation type,Operator, andThreshold valueas desired. A typical threshold is: Static, Maximum, Greater than, 80%.FieldDescriptionThresholdSelect if the threshold should be evaluated based on a static value or a dynamic value.Astatic thresholdevaluates the rule by using the threshold value that you configure.Dynamic thresholdsuse machine learning algorithms to continuously learn the metric behavior patterns and calculate the appropriate thresholds for unexpected behavior. You can learn more about usingdynamic thresholds for metric alerts.OperatorSelect the operator for comparing the metric value against the threshold.If you're using dynamic thresholds, alert rules can use tailored thresholds based on metric behavior for both upper and lower bounds in the same alert rule. Select one of these operators:- Greater than the upper threshold or lower than the lower threshold (default)- Greater than the upper threshold- Lower than the lower thresholdAggregation typeSelect the aggregation function to apply on the data points: Sum, Count, Average, Min, or Max.Threshold valueIf you selected astaticthreshold, enter the threshold value for the condition logic.UnitIf the selected metric signal supports different units, such as bytes, KB, MB, and GB, and if you selected astaticthreshold, enter the unit for the condition logic.Threshold sensitivityIf you selected adynamicthreshold, enter the sensitivity level. The sensitivity level affects the amount of deviation from the metric series pattern that's required to trigger an alert.-High: Thresholds are tight and close to the metric series pattern. An alert rule is triggered on the smallest deviation, resulting in more alerts.-Medium: Thresholds are less tight and more balanced. There are fewer alerts than with high sensitivity (default).-Low: Thresholds are loose, allowing greater deviation from the metric series pattern. Alert rules are only triggered on large deviations, resulting in fewer alerts.Aggregation granularitySelect the interval that's used to group the data points by using the aggregation type function. Choose anAggregation granularity(period) that's greater than theFrequency of evaluationto reduce the likelihood of missing the first evaluation period of an added time series.Frequency of evaluationSelect how often the alert rule is to be run. Select a frequency that's smaller than the aggregation granularity to generate a sliding window for the evaluation.
Configure aThresholdtype to determine when the alert will take action. ChooseAggregation type,Operator, andThreshold valueas desired. A typical threshold is: Static, Maximum, Greater than, 80%.
UnderWhen to evaluate, determine the desired frequency of evaluation. Use theCheck everyandLookback perioddropdown lists.

Optionally, you can add multiple conditions for this alert, choose theAdd conditionalert if desired.

In Azure SQL Database, capture events and configure alerts for resource service health in theResource healthsignal category. This category is not available for dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics.
On theConditionspane, selectSee all signals.
On theConditionspane, selectSee all signals.
On theSelect a signalpane, selectResource health. SelectApply.
On theSelect a signalpane, selectResource health. SelectApply.
TheEvent status,Current resource status,Previous resource status, andResource typedropdowns provide options to configure alerts for many possible resource health status changes. By default, all possible status and status changes are select, so that you can send alerts for the detection and resolution of service health problems.FieldDescriptionEvent statusSelect the statuses of Resource Health events. Values areActive,In Progress,Resolved, andUpdated.Current resource statusSelect the current resource status. Values areAvailable,Degraded, andUnavailable.Previous resource statusSelect the previous resource status. Values areAvailable,Degraded,Unavailable, andUnknown.Reason typeSelect the causes of the Resource Health events. Values arePlatform Initiated,Unknown, andUser Initiated.

Create the new alert rule
Select an existingAction groupfrom theSelect action groupspane, orCreate action groupin your subscription. An action group enables you to define the action to be taken when an alert condition occurs. This action defines what happens upon triggering an alert (for example, sending an email).Alternatively, use theUse quick actionsfeature to create a new action group and provide an email or Azure mobile app notification target.

By default, an alert rule's severity is3 - Informational. You can adjust the alert rule'sSeverityas desired.
Provide theAlert rule name. Optionally but recommended, provide a description.
UnderAdvanced options:Make sureEnable upon creationfor the alert rule to start running as soon as you're done creating it.TheAutomatically resolve alertsoptions is enabled by default. This will make the alert stateful, which means that the alert is resolved when the condition isn't met anymore.

SelectNext: Tags >.
Consider using Azure tags. For example, the "Owner" or "CreatedBy" tag to identify who created the resource, and the "Environment" tag to identify whether this resource is in production, development, etc. For more information, seeDevelop your naming and tagging strategy for Azure resources.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate. Soon, the alert is active.
Manage alert rules
Note
To suppress noisy alerts, seeSuppression of alerts using action rules.
Existing alerts need to be managed from theAlertsmenu in the Azure portal resource menu. To view, suspend, activate, modify, and delete existing alerts:
On theAlertspane of your Azure SQL Database, selectAlert rules.
On theAlertspane of your Azure SQL Database, selectAlert rules.

Select an individual existing alert rule to manage it. Existing active rules can be modified and tuned to your preference. Active rules can also be suspended without being deleted.
