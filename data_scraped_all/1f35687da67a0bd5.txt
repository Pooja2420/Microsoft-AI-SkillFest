Use this task to providenpmcredentials to an.npmrcfile in your repository for the scope of the build. This enablesnpm, as well asnpmtask runners like gulp and Grunt, to authenticate with private registries.

Syntax
# npm authenticate (for task runners) v0
# Don't use this task if you're also using the npm task. Provides npm credentials to an .npmrc file in your repository for the scope of the build. This enables npm task runners like gulp and Grunt to authenticate with private registries.
- task: npmAuthenticate@0
  inputs:
    workingFile: # string. Required. .npmrc file to authenticate. 
    #customEndpoint: # string. Credentials for registries outside this organization/collection.

workingFile
string
The path to the.npmrcfile that specifies the registries you want to work with. Select the file, not the folder, such as/packages/mypackage.npmrc.
.npmrc
/packages/mypackage.npmrc
customEndpoint-Credentials for registries outside this organization/collectionstring.
customEndpoint
string
The comma-separated list ofnpm service connectionnames for registries outside this organization or collection. The specified.npmrcfile must contain registry entries corresponding to the service connections. If you only need registries in this organization or collection, leave this blank. The build's credentials are used automatically.

How does this task work?
This task searches the specified.npmrcfile for registry entries, then appends authentication details for the discovered registries to the end of the file. For all registries in the current organization/collection, the build's credentials are used. For  registries in a different organization or hosted by a third-party, the registry URIs will be compared to the URIs of thenpm service connectionsspecified by thecustomEndpointinput, and the corresponding credentials will be used. The.npmrcfile will be reverted to its original state at the end of the pipeline execution.

When in my pipeline should I run this task?
This task must run before you usenpm, or annpmtask runner, to install or push packages to an authenticated npm repository such as Azure Artifacts. There are no other ordering requirements.

I have multiple npm projects. Do I need to run this task for each .npmrc file?
This task will only add authentication details to one.npmrcfile at a time. If you need authentication for multiple.npmrcfiles, you can run the task multiple times, once for each.npmrcfile. Alternately, consider creating an.npmrcfile that specifies all registries used by your projects, runningnpmAuthenticateon this.npmrcfile, and then setting an environment variable to designate this.npmrcfile as the npm per-user configuration file.

My agent is behind a web proxy. WillnpmAuthenticateset upnpm/gulp/Gruntto use my proxy?
npmAuthenticate
npm/gulp/Grunt
The answer is no. While this task itself will work behind a web proxyyour agent has been configured to use, it does not configurenpmornpmtask runners to use the proxy.

To do so, you can either:
Set the environment variableshttp_proxy/https_proxyand optionallyno_proxyto your proxy settings. Seenpm configfor details. Note that these are commonly used variables which other non-npmtools (e.g. curl) may also use.

- script: npm ci --https-proxy $(agent.proxyurl)
- script: npm ci --https-proxy $(agent.proxyurl)
If your proxy requires authentication, you may need to add an additional build step to construct an authenticated proxy URI.
- script: node -e "let u = url.parse(`$(agent.proxyurl)`); u.auth = `$(agent.proxyusername):$(agent.proxypassword)`; console.log(`##vso[task.setvariable variable=proxyAuthUri;issecret=true]` + url.format(u))"
- script: npm publish --https-proxy $(proxyAuthUri)
- script: node -e "let u = url.parse(`$(agent.proxyurl)`); u.auth = `$(agent.proxyusername):$(agent.proxypassword)`; console.log(`##vso[task.setvariable variable=proxyAuthUri;issecret=true]` + url.format(u))"
- script: npm publish --https-proxy $(proxyAuthUri)
My Pipeline needs to access a feed in a different project
If the pipeline is running in a different project than the project hosting the feed, you must set up the other project to grant read/write access to the build service. SeePackage permissions in Azure Pipelinesfor more details.

If your.npmrccontains Azure Artifacts registries from a different organization or use a third-party authenticated package repository, you'll need to set upnpm service connectionsand specify them in thecustomEndpointinput.
Registries within your Azure Artifacts organization will also be automatically authenticated.
.npmrc

.npmrc

The registry URL pointing to an Azure Artifacts feed may or may not contain the project. An URL for a project scoped feed must contain the project, and the URL for an organization scoped feed must not contain the project. Learn more aboutproject scoped feeds.
