This article helps you configure virtual hub routing using Azure portal. You can also configure virtual hub routing using theAzure PowerShell steps.
A virtual hub can contain multiple gateways such as a site-to-site VPN gateway, ExpressRoute gateway, point-to-site gateway, and Azure Firewall. The routing capabilities in the virtual hub are provided by a router that manages all routing, including transit routing, between the gateways using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The virtual hub router also provides transit connectivity between virtual networks that connect to a virtual hub and can support up to an aggregate throughput of 50 Gbps. These routing capabilities apply to customers usingStandardVirtual WANs. For more information, seeAbout virtual hub routing.
Create a route table
The following steps help you create a route table and a route.
In the Azure portal, go to thevirtual hub.
In the Azure portal, go to thevirtual hub.
On theVirtual HUBpage, in the left pane, selectRoute Tablesto open the Route Tables page. Notice the route tables that are propagated to this virtual hub.

Select+ Create route tableto open theCreate Route Tablepage.
Select+ Create route tableto open theCreate Route Tablepage.
On theBasicstab, complete the following fields, then clickLabelsto move to the Labels page.Name: Name the route table instance.Route name: Name the route.Destination type: Select from the dropdown.Destination prefix: You can aggregate prefixes. For example: VNet 1: 10.1.0.0/24 and VNet 2: 10.1.1.0/24 can be aggregated as 10.1.0.0/16.Branchroutes apply to all connected VPN sites, ExpressRoute circuits, and User VPN connections.Next hop: A list of virtual network connections, or Azure Firewall.Next Hop IP: If you select a virtual network connection for Next hop, you'll seeConfigure static routeswhen you clickConfigure. This is an optional configuration setting. For more information, seeConfiguring static routes.

Name: Name the route table instance.
Route name: Name the route.
Destination type: Select from the dropdown.
Destination prefix: You can aggregate prefixes. For example: VNet 1: 10.1.0.0/24 and VNet 2: 10.1.1.0/24 can be aggregated as 10.1.0.0/16.Branchroutes apply to all connected VPN sites, ExpressRoute circuits, and User VPN connections.
Next hop: A list of virtual network connections, or Azure Firewall.
Next Hop IP: If you select a virtual network connection for Next hop, you'll seeConfigure static routeswhen you clickConfigure. This is an optional configuration setting. For more information, seeConfiguring static routes.
On theLabelspage, configure label names. Labels provide a mechanism to logically group route tables. Configure any required labels, then move to the Associations page.

On theAssociationspage, associate connections to the route table. You'll seeBranches,Virtual Networks, and theCurrent settingsof the connections. After configuring settings, move to the Propagations page.

SelectCreateto create the route table.
SelectCreateto create the route table.
Edit a route table
Go to the virtual hub and, in the left pane, clickRoute Tables. On theRoute Tablespage, click the name of the route table you want to edit.
On theEdit route tablepage, on each tab, edit the values that you want to change.
On thePropagationspage, clickCreateto update the route table with new route information.
Edit a route
Go to the virtual hub and, in the left pane, clickRoute Tables. On theRoute Tablespage, click the name of the route table that contains the route you want to edit.
On theEdit route tablepage, locate the route from the list and make the applicable changes. Then, clickReview + create.
On thePropagationspage, make any additional changes (if necessary), then clickCreateto update the route table with new route information.
As long as no errors occur, the route is updated.
Delete a route
Go to the virtual hub and, in the left pane, clickRoute Tables. On theRoute Tablespage, click the name of the route table that contains the route you want to edit.
On theEdit route tablepage, locate the route from the list. Use the scroll bar to navigate to the right. You'll see an ellipsis (three dots) at the end of the line for the route. Click the ellipsis to reveal theRemovebutton. ClickRemove.
At the bottom of the page, clickReview + Create, and thenCreate.
As long as no errors occur, the route is removed.
Delete a route table
You can't delete aDefaultorNoneroute table. However, you can delete all custom route tables.
Go to the virtual hub and, in the left pane, clickRoute Tables. On theRoute Tablespage, select the checkbox for the route table that you want to delete (don't click the name).
On the right side of the line that the route table is on, you'll see an ellipsis (three dots). Click the ellipsis, then selectDeletefrom the dropdown list.
On theDeletepage, confirm that you want to delete the route table, then clickDelete.
As long as no errors occur, the route table is deleted.
View effective routes
In the Azure portal, go to yourVirtual HUB -> Effective Routespage.
In the Azure portal, go to yourVirtual HUB -> Effective Routespage.
From the dropdowns, select the route table to view routes learned by the selected route table. Propagated routes from the connection to the route table are automatically populated inEffective Routesof the route table. For more information, seeAbout effective routes.

Configure routing for a virtual network connection
In the Azure portal, go to yourVirtual WANIn the left pane, selectVirtual network connections.
In the Azure portal, go to yourVirtual WANIn the left pane, selectVirtual network connections.
On theVirtual network connectionspage, select+ Add connection.
On theVirtual network connectionspage, select+ Add connection.
On theAdd connectionpage, configure the connection settings. For information about routing settings, seeAbout routing.Connection name: Name your connection.Hubs: Select the hub you want to associate with this connection.Subscription: Verify the subscription.Resource group: Select the resource group that contains the virtual network to which you want to connect.Virtual network: Select the virtual network you want to connect to this hub. The virtual network you select can't have an already existing virtual network gateway.Propagate to none: This is set toNoby default. Changing the switch toYesmakes the configuration options forPropagate to Route TablesandPropagate to labelsunavailable for configuration.Associate Route Table: From the dropdown, you can select a route table that you want to associate.Propagate to labels: Labels are a logical group of route tables. For this setting, select from the dropdown.Static routes: Configure static routes, if necessary. Configure static routes for Network Virtual Appliances (if applicable). Virtual WAN supports a single next hop IP for static route in a virtual network connection. For example, if you have a separate virtual appliance for ingress and egress traffic flows, it would be best to have the virtual appliances in separate VNets and attach the VNets to the virtual hub.Bypass Next Hop IP for workloads within this VNet: This setting lets you deploy NVAs and other workloads into the same VNet without forcing all the traffic through the NVA. This setting can only be configured when you're configuring a new connection. If you want to use this setting for a connection you've already created, delete the connection, then add a new connection.Propagate static route: This setting lets you propagate static routes defined in theStatic routessection to route tables specifiedâ¯inPropagate to Route Tables. Additionally, routes will be propagated to route tables that have labels specified asPropagate to labels. These routes can be propagated inter-hub, except for the default route 0/0.
