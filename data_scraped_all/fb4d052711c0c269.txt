You can customize egress for an AKS cluster to fit specific scenarios. By default, AKS creates a Standard Load Balancer to be set up and used for egress. However, the default setup may not meet the requirements of all scenarios if public IPs are disallowed or extra hops are required for egress.
This article covers the various types of outbound connectivity that are available in AKS clusters.
Note
You can now update theoutboundTypeafter cluster creation.
outboundType
Important
In nonprivate clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using aprivate cluster, or check out theAPI Server VNet Integrationfeature.
Limitations

Outbound types in AKS
You can configure an AKS cluster using the following outbound types: load balancer, NAT gateway, or user-defined routing. The outbound type impacts only the egress traffic of your cluster. For more information, seesetting up ingress controllers.
Outbound type ofloadBalancer
loadBalancer
The load balancer is used for egress through an AKS-assigned public IP. An outbound type ofloadBalancersupports Kubernetes services of typeloadBalancer, which expect egress out of the load balancer created by the AKS resource provider.
loadBalancer
loadBalancer
IfloadBalanceris set, AKS automatically completes the following configuration:
loadBalancer
A public IP address is created for cluster egress.
The public IP address is assigned to the load balancer resource.
Backend pools for the load balancer are set up for agent nodes in the cluster.

For more information, seeusing a standard load balancer in AKS.
Outbound type ofmanagedNatGatewayoruserAssignedNatGateway
managedNatGateway
userAssignedNatGateway
IfmanagedNatGatewayoruserAssignedNatGatewayare selected foroutboundType, AKS relies onAzure Networking NAT gatewayfor cluster egress.
managedNatGateway
userAssignedNatGateway
outboundType
SelectmanagedNatGatewaywhen using managed virtual networks. AKS provisions a NAT gateway and attach it to the cluster subnet.
managedNatGateway
SelectuserAssignedNatGatewaywhen using bring-your-own virtual networking. This option requires that you have a NAT gateway created before cluster creation.
userAssignedNatGateway
For more information, seeusing NAT gateway with AKS.
Outbound type ofuserDefinedRouting
userDefinedRouting
Note
TheuserDefinedRoutingoutbound type is an advanced networking scenario and requires proper network configuration.
userDefinedRouting
IfuserDefinedRoutingis set, AKS doesn't automatically configure egress paths. The egress setup is completed by you.
userDefinedRouting
You must deploy the AKS cluster into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is configured. Since you're not using a standard load balancer (SLB) architecture, you must establish explicit egress. This architecture requires explicitly sending egress traffic to an appliance like a firewall, gateway, proxy or to allow NAT to be done by a public IP assigned to the standard load balancer or appliance.
For more information, seeconfiguring cluster egress via user-defined routing.

Thenoneoutbound type is only available withNetwork Isolated Clusterand requires careful planning to ensure the cluster operates as expected without unintended dependencies on external services. For fully isolated clusters, seeisolated cluster considerations.

Ifnoneis set, AKS won't automatically configure egress paths. This option is similar touserDefinedRoutingbut doesnotrequire a default route as part of validation.
none
userDefinedRouting
Thenoneoutbound type is supported in both bring-your-own (BYO) virtual network scenarios and managed VNet scenarios. However, you must ensure that the AKS cluster is deployed into a network environment where explicit egress paths are defined if needed. For BYO VNet scenarios, the cluster must be deployed into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is already configured. Since AKS doesn't create a standard load balancer or any egress infrastructure, you must establish explicit egress paths if needed. Egress options can include routing traffic to a firewall, proxy, gateway, or other custom network configurations.

block
Important
Theblockoutbound type is only available withNetwork Isolated Clusterand requires careful planning to ensure no unintended network dependencies exist. For fully isolated clusters, seeisolated cluster considerations.
block
Ifblockis set, AKS configures network rules toactively block all egress trafficfrom the cluster. This option is useful for highly secure environments where outbound connectivity must be restricted.
block
When usingblock:
block
AKS ensures that no public internet traffic can leave the cluster through network security group (NSG) rules. VNet traffic isn't affected.
You must explicitly allow any required egress traffic through extra network configurations.
Theblockoption provides another level of network isolation but requires careful planning to avoid breaking workloads or dependencies.

UpdatingoutboundTypeafter cluster creation
outboundType
Changing the outbound type after cluster creation deploys or removes resources as required to put the cluster into the new egress configuration.
The following tables show the supported migration paths between outbound types for managed and BYO virtual networks.
Supported Migration Paths for Managed VNet
Each row shows whether the outbound type can be migrated to the types listed across the top. "Supported" means migration is possible, while "Not Supported" or "N/A" means it isnât.

Warning
Migrating the outbound type to user managed types (userAssignedNATGatewayoruserDefinedRouting) will change the outbound public IP addresses of the cluster.
ifAuthorized IP rangesis enabled, ensure new outbound IP range is appended to authorized IP range.
userAssignedNATGateway
userDefinedRouting
Warning
Changing the outbound type on a cluster is disruptive to network connectivity and results in a change of the cluster's egress IP address. If any firewall rules are configured to restrict traffic from the cluster, you need to update them to match the new egress IP address.
Update cluster to use a new outbound type
Note
You must use a version >= 2.56 of Azure CLI to migrate outbound type. Useaz upgradeto update to the latest version of Azure CLI.
az upgrade
Update the outbound configuration of your cluster using theaz aks updatecommand.
az aks update
Update cluster from loadbalancer to managedNATGateway
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type managedNATGateway --nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type managedNATGateway --nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>
Update cluster from managedNATGateway to loadbalancer
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> \
--outbound-type loadBalancer \
<--load-balancer-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>| --load-balancer-outbound-ips <outbound ip ids> | --load-balancer-outbound-ip-prefixes <outbound ip prefix ids> >
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> \
--outbound-type loadBalancer \
<--load-balancer-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>| --load-balancer-outbound-ips <outbound ip ids> | --load-balancer-outbound-ip-prefixes <outbound ip prefix ids> >
Warning
Don't reuse an IP address that is already in use in prior outbound configurations.
