This article steps through using the Azure portal to create highly resilient virtual machines inavailability zones. Azure availability zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures. Use availability zones to protect your applications and data against unlikely datacenter failures.
To use availability zones, create your virtual machines in asupported Azure region.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

ForAvailability zone, the drop-down defaults toZone 1. If you choose multiple zones, a new VM is created in each zone. For example, if you select all three zones, then three VMs are created. The VM names are the original name you entered, with-1,-2, and-3appended to the name based on number of zones selected. If you want, you can edit each of the default VM names.

Complete the rest of the page as usual. If you want to create a load balancer, go to theNetworkingtab >Load Balancing>Load balancing options. You can choose either an Azure load balancer or an Application gateway.For anAzure load balancer:You can select an existing load balancer or selectCreate a load balancer.To create a new load balancer, forLoad balancer nametype a load balancer name.Select theTypeof load balancer, eitherPublicorInternal.Select theProtocol, eitherTCPorUDP.You can leave the defaultPortandBackend port, or change them if needed. The backend port you select will be opened up on the Network Security Group (NSG) of the VM.When you're done, selectCreate.For anApplication Gateway:Select either an existing application gateway orCreate an application gateway.To create a new gateway, type the name for the application gateway. The Application Gateway can load balance multiple applications. Consider naming the Application Gateway according to the workloads you wish to load balance, rather than specific to the virtual machine name.InRouting rule, type a rule name. The rule name should describe the workload you are load balancing.For HTTP load balancing, you can leave the defaults and then selectCreate. For HTTPS load balancing, you have two options:Upload a certificate and add the password (application gateway manages certificate storage). For certificate name, type a friendly name for the certificate.Use a key vault (application gateway will pull a defined certificate from a defined key vault). Select yourManaged identity,Key Vault, andCertificate.ImportantAfter the VMs and application gateway are deployed, log in to the VMs to ensure that either the application gateway certificate is uploaded onto the VMs or the domain name of the VM certificate matches with the domain name of the application gateway.NoteA separate subnet will be defined for Application Gateway upon creation. For more information, seeApplication Gateway infrastructure configuration.

For anAzure load balancer:
You can select an existing load balancer or selectCreate a load balancer.
To create a new load balancer, forLoad balancer nametype a load balancer name.
Select theTypeof load balancer, eitherPublicorInternal.
Select theProtocol, eitherTCPorUDP.
You can leave the defaultPortandBackend port, or change them if needed. The backend port you select will be opened up on the Network Security Group (NSG) of the VM.
When you're done, selectCreate.
For anApplication Gateway:
Select either an existing application gateway orCreate an application gateway.
To create a new gateway, type the name for the application gateway. The Application Gateway can load balance multiple applications. Consider naming the Application Gateway according to the workloads you wish to load balance, rather than specific to the virtual machine name.
InRouting rule, type a rule name. The rule name should describe the workload you are load balancing.

Use a key vault (application gateway will pull a defined certificate from a defined key vault). Select yourManaged identity,Key Vault, andCertificate.
Important
After the VMs and application gateway are deployed, log in to the VMs to ensure that either the application gateway certificate is uploaded onto the VMs or the domain name of the VM certificate matches with the domain name of the application gateway.
Note
A separate subnet will be defined for Application Gateway upon creation. For more information, seeApplication Gateway infrastructure configuration.

Create a Zonal Virtual Machine in an Azure-selected Zone
Important
These features are currently in PREVIEW. See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
If you would like the resiliency benefits of a Zonal Virtual Machine and want help with selecting a zone, you can have Azure select the best-fit zone for your deployment.
Note
Please review the Restrictions section before deploying your VM using an Azure-Selected Zone.
Sign in to theAzure portal using this linkenabling the feature.
In the Basics tab, under Project details, make sure the correct subscription is selected and then choose a resource group or create a new one.
Under Instance details, type a name for the Virtual machine name.
For Availability options, Ensure Availability zone is selected.
For Zone options (Preview), select Azure-selected zone. The Availability zone selection should now be grayed out.
Configure the rest of your Virtual Machine as normal for deployment.

Restrictions
Regions
Deploying a VM into an Azure-selected zone is available in all Zonal Regions except the following regions.
BrazilSouth
CentralIndia
EastUS
JapanEast
KoreaCentral
Disks
Existing OS and Data Disks are currently not supported. New Data Disk Source Type must be "none".
Standard HDDs (hard disk drives)
Premium SSDs
Premium SSD V2
Ultra Disks
Standard SSD ZRS
Standard SSD LRS

Other resources
Existing Public IPs aren't supported for an Azure-selected zone. They can be added after deployment.
New Public IPs must be Zone Redundant or use an Azure-Selected Zone.
Load Balancers and Application Gateways must be Zonally Resilient to attach during the VM deployment.
Proximity Placement Groups, Capacity Reservation Groups, and Azure Dedicated Host aren't supported.
Site Recovery configuration isn't available during VM creation but can be configured after deployment.
