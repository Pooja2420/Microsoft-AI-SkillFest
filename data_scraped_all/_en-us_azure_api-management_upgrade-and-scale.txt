Customers can scale an Azure API Management instance in a dedicated service tier by adding and removing units. Aunitis composed of dedicated Azure resources and has a certain load-bearing capacity expressed as a number of API calls per second. This number doesn't represent a call limit, but rather an estimated maximum throughput value to allow for rough capacity planning. Actual throughput and latency vary broadly depending on factors such as number and rate of concurrent connections, the kind and number of configured policies, request and response sizes, and backend latency.
Note
In theBasic,Standard, andPremiumtiers of the API Management service, you can configure an instance toscale automaticallybased on a set of rules.
API Management instances in theConsumptiontier scale automatically based on the traffic. Currently, you cannot upgrade from or downgrade to the Consumption tier.
The throughput and price of each unit depend on theservice tierin which the unit exists. If you need to increase capacity for a service within a tier, you should add a unit. If the tier that is currently selected in your API Management instance doesn't allow adding more units, you need to upgrade to a higher-level tier.
Note
SeeAPI Management pricingfor features, scale limits, and estimated throughput in each tier. To get more accurate throughput numbers, you need to look at a realistic scenario for your APIs. SeeCapacity of an Azure API Management instance.
Important
Changes to your API Management service's infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration.
While the service is updating, other service infrastructure changes can't be made. However, you can configure APIs, products, policies, and user settings. The service will not experience gateway downtime (except in the Developer tier).

Upgrade and scale
You can choose between the following dedicated tiers:Developer,Basic,Basic v2,Standard,Standard v2,Premium, andPremium v2.
TheDevelopertier should be used to evaluate the service; it shouldn't be used for production. TheDevelopertier doesn't have SLA and you can't scale this tier (add/remove units).

Basic,Basic v2,Standard,Standard v2,Premium, andPremium v2(limited preview) are tiers that have SLA and can be scaled. For pricing details and scale limits, seeAPI Management pricing.

ThePremiumtier enables you to distribute a single Azure API Management instance across any number of desired Azure regions. When you initially create an Azure API Management service, the instance contains only one unit and resides in a single Azure region (theprimaryregion).Additional regions can be easily added. When adding a region, you specify the number of units you want to allocate. For example, you can have one unit in the primary region and five units in some other region. You can tailor the number of units to the traffic you have in each region. For more information, seeHow to deploy an Azure API Management service instance to multiple Azure regions.

Scale your API Management instance
You can use the portal to scale your API Management instance. How you scale depends on the service tier you are using.

Add or remove units - classic service tiers
Navigate to your API Management instance in theAzure portal.
SelectLocationsfrom the left-hand menu.
Select the row with the location you want to scale.
Specify the new number ofUnits- use the slider if available, or select or type the number.
SelectApply.
Note
In thePremiumservice tier, you can optionally configure availability zones and a virtual network in a selected location. For more information, seeDeploy API Management service to an additional location.
Add or remove units - v2 service tiers
Navigate to your API Management instance in theAzure portal.
SelectScalefrom the left-hand menu.
Specify the new number ofUnits- use the slider, or select or type the number.
SelectSave.
Add or remove units - workspace gateway
Navigate to your API Management instance in theAzure portal.
In the left menu, underAPIs, selectWorkspaces> the name of your workspace.
In the left menu, underDeployment + infrastructure, selectGateways> the name of your gateway.
In the left menu, underDeployment and infrastructure,  selectScale.
Specify the new number ofUnits- use the slider, or select or type the number.
SelectSave.
Change your API Management service tier
Navigate to your API Management instance in theAzure portal.
SelectPricing tierin the menu.
Select the desired service tier from the dropdown. Use the slider to specify the number of units for your API Management service after the change.
SelectSave.
Downtime during scaling up and down
If you're scaling from or to theDevelopertier, there will be downtime. Otherwise, there is no downtime.
Compute isolation
If your security requirements includecompute isolation, you can use theIsolatedpricing tier. This tier ensures the compute resources of an API Management service instance consume the entire physical host and provide the necessary level of isolation required to support, for example, US Department of Defense Impact Level 5 (IL5) workloads. To get access to the Isolated tier,create a support request.
