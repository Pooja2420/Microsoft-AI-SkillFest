You can troubleshoot errors encountered while using Azure Backup with the information listed below:
Backup
This section covers backup operation failure of Azure Virtual machine.
Basic troubleshooting
Ensure that the VM Agent (WA Agent) is thelatest version.
Ensure that the Windows or Linux VM OS version is supported, refer to theIaaS VM Backup Support Matrix.
Verify that another backup service isn't running.To ensure there are no snapshot extension issues,uninstall extensions to force reload and then retry the backup.
To ensure there are no snapshot extension issues,uninstall extensions to force reload and then retry the backup.
Verify that the VM has internet connectivity.Make sure another backup service isn't running.
Make sure another backup service isn't running.
FromServices.msc, ensure theWindows Azure Guest Agentservice isRunning. If theWindows Azure Guest Agentservice is missing, install it fromBack up Azure VMs in a Recovery Services vault.
Services.msc
TheEvent logmay show backup failures that are from other backup products, for example, Windows Server backup aren't happening due to Azure Backup. Use the following steps to determine whether the issue is with Azure Backup:If there's an error with the entryBackupin the event source or message, check whether Azure IaaS VM Backup backups were successful, and whether a Restore Point was created with the desired snapshot type.If Azure Backup is working, then the issue is likely with another backup solution.Here is an example of an Event Viewer error 517 where Azure Backup was working fine but "Windows Server Backup" was failing:If Azure Backup is failing, then look for the corresponding error code in theCommon issuessection.If you see Azure Backup option greyed out on an Azure VM, hover over the disabled menu to find the reason. The reasons could be  "Not available with EphemeralDisk" or "Not available with Ultra Disk".

Common issues
The following are common issues with backup failures on Azure virtual machines.
VMRestorePointInternalError - Antivirus configured in the VM is restricting the execution of backup extension
Error code: VMRestorePointInternalError
If at the time of backup, theEvent Viewer Application logsdisplays the messageFaulting application name: IaaSBcdrExtension.exethen it's confirmed that the antivirus configured in the VM is restricting the execution of backup extension.
To resolve this issue, exclude the directories below in the antivirus configuration and retry the backup operation.
C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot
C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot
C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot
C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshot
CopyingVHDsFromBackUpVaultTakingLongTime - Copying backed up data from vault timed out
Error code: CopyingVHDsFromBackUpVaultTakingLongTimeError message: Copying backed up data from vault timed out
This could happen due to transient storage errors or insufficient storage account IOPS for backup service to transfer data to the vault within the timeout period. Configure VM backup using thesebest practicesand retry the backup operation.
UserErrorVmNotInDesirableState - VM is not in a state that allows backups
Error code: UserErrorVmNotInDesirableStateError message: VM is not in a state that allows backups.
The backup operation failed because the VM is in Failed state. For a successful backup, the VM state should be Running, Stopped, or Stopped (deallocated).
If the VM is in a transient state betweenRunningandShut down, wait for the state to change. Then trigger the backup job.
If the VM is a Linux VM and uses the Security-Enhanced Linux kernel module, exclude the Azure Linux Agent path/var/lib/waagentfrom the security policy and make sure the Backup extension is installed.
UserErrorFsFreezeFailed - Failed to freeze one or more mount-points of the VM to take a file-system consistent snapshot
Error code: UserErrorFsFreezeFailedError message: Failed to freeze one or more mount-points of the VM to take a file-system consistent snapshot.
Step 1:
Unmount the devices for which the file system state wasn't cleaned, using theumountcommand.
Run a file system consistency check on these devices by using thefsckcommand.
Mount the devices again and retry backup operation.
If you can't un-mount the devices then you can update the VM backup configuration to ignore certain mount points. For example, if '/mnt/resource' mount point can't be un-mounted and causing the VM backup failures, you can update the VM backup configuration files with theMountsToSkipproperty as follows.
MountsToSkip
Check if there is thevmbackup.conffile under the/etc/azure/directory.
Check if there is thevmbackup.conffile under the/etc/azure/directory.
/etc/azure/
If there's no/etc/azure/vmbackup.conf, you can copy file from the/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0.XXX.0/main/tempPlugin/vmbackup.conf.
If there's no/etc/azure/vmbackup.conf, you can copy file from the/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0.XXX.0/main/tempPlugin/vmbackup.conf.
/etc/azure/vmbackup.conf
/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.Azure.RecoveryServices.VMSnapshotLinux-1.0.XXX.0/main/tempPlugin/vmbackup.conf
In the/etc/azure/vmbackup.conffile, add the following configuration for Azure VM Backup to skipfsfreezeand take snapshot for the/mnt/resourcemount point.cat  /etc/azure/vmbackup.conf[SnapshotThread]
fsfreeze: True
MountsToSkip = /mnt/resource
SafeFreezeWaitInSeconds=600
In the/etc/azure/vmbackup.conffile, add the following configuration for Azure VM Backup to skipfsfreezeand take snapshot for the/mnt/resourcemount point.
/etc/azure/vmbackup.conf
fsfreeze
/mnt/resource
cat  /etc/azure/vmbackup.conf[SnapshotThread]
fsfreeze: True
MountsToSkip = /mnt/resource
SafeFreezeWaitInSeconds=600
cat  /etc/azure/vmbackup.conf[SnapshotThread]
fsfreeze: True
MountsToSkip = /mnt/resource
SafeFreezeWaitInSeconds=600
Step 2:
Check if there are duplicate mount points present.
Identify the failed to freeze mount points from the extension log file.For example: /boot, /usr/sap in the below sample output.
2017-11-02 11:22:56 Thawing: /boot
    2017-11-02 11:22:56 Failed to FITHAW: /boot

    2017-11-02 11:22:56 Failed to FITHAW: /usr/sap
On the Linux VM execute 'mount' command and check if the failed mount points have multiple entries. If yes, remove the old entries or rename the mount path and retry the backup operation.
ExtensionSnapshotFailedCOM / ExtensionInstallationFailedCOM / ExtensionInstallationFailedMDTC - Extension installation/operation failed due to a COM+ error
Error code: ExtensionSnapshotFailedCOMError message: Snapshot operation failed due to COM+ error
Error code: ExtensionInstallationFailedCOMError message: Extension installation/operation failed due to a COM+ error

ExtensionFailedVssWriterInBadState - Snapshot operation failed because VSS writers were in a bad state
Error code: ExtensionFailedVssWriterInBadStateError message: Snapshot operation failed because VSS writers were in a bad state.
This error occurs because the VSS writers were in a bad state. Azure Backup extensions interact with VSS Writers to take snapshots of the disks. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
Step 1:Check theFree Disk Space,VM resources as RAM and page file, andCPU utilization percentage.
Increase the VM size to increase vCPUs and RAM space.
Increase the disk size if the free disk space is low.
Step 2:Restart VSS writers that are in a bad state.
From an elevated command prompt, runvssadmin list writers.
From an elevated command prompt, runvssadmin list writers.
vssadmin list writers
The output contains all VSS writers and their state. For every VSS writer with a state that's not[1] Stable, restart the respective VSS writer's service.
The output contains all VSS writers and their state. For every VSS writer with a state that's not[1] Stable, restart the respective VSS writer's service.
To restart the service, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:net stop serviceNamenet start serviceName
To restart the service, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
net stop serviceNamenet start serviceName
net stop serviceName
net start serviceName
Note
Restarting some services can have an impact on your production environment. Ensure the approval process is followed and the service is restarted at the scheduled downtime.
Step 3:If restarting the VSS writers did not resolve the issue, then run the following command from an elevated command-prompt (as an administrator) to prevent the threads from being created for blob-snapshots.
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v SnapshotWithoutThreads /t REG_SZ /d True /f
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v SnapshotWithoutThreads /t REG_SZ /d True /f
Step 4:If steps 1 and 2 did not resolve the issue, then the failure could be due to VSS writers timing out due to limited IOPS.
To verify, navigate toSystem and Event Viewer Application logsand check for the following error message:The shadow copy provider timed out while holding writes to the volume being shadow copied. This is probably due to excessive activity on the volume by an application or a system service. Try again later when activity on the volume is reduced.
Solution:
Check for possibilities to distribute the load across the VM disks. This will reduce the load on single disks. You cancheck the IOPs throttling by enabling diagnostic metrics at storage level.
Change the backup policy to perform backups during off peak hours, when the load on the VM is at its lowest.
Upgrade the Azure disks to support higher IOPs.Learn more here
ExtensionFailedVssServiceInBadState - Snapshot operation failed due to VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) service in bad state
Error code: ExtensionFailedVssServiceInBadStateError message: Snapshot operation failed due to VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) service in bad state.
This error occurs because the VSS service was in a bad state. Azure Backup extensions interact with VSS service to take snapshots of the disks. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
Restart VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) service.
Navigate to Services.msc and restart 'Volume Shadow Copy service'.(or)
Navigate to Services.msc and restart 'Volume Shadow Copy service'.(or)
Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:net stop VSSnet start VSS
Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:
net stop VSSnet start VSS
net stop VSS
net start VSS
If the issue still persists, restart the VM at the scheduled downtime.
UserErrorSkuNotAvailable - VM creation failed as VM size selected is not available
Error code: UserErrorSkuNotAvailable
Error message: VM creation failed as VM size selected is not available.
This error occurs because the VM size selected during the restore operation is an unsupported size.
To resolve this issue, use therestore disksoption during the restore operation. Use those disks to create a VM from the list ofavailable supported VM sizesusingPowerShell cmdlets.
UserErrorMarketPlaceVMNotSupported - VM creation failed due to Market Place purchase request being not present
Error code: UserErrorMarketPlaceVMNotSupported
Error message: VM creation failed due to Market Place purchase request being not present.
Azure Backup supports backup and restore of VMs that are available in Azure Marketplace. This error occurs when you try to restore a VM (with a specific Plan/Publisher setting), which is no longer available in Azure Marketplace.Learn more here.
In this scenario, a partial failure happens where the disks are restored, but the VM isn't restored. This is because it's not possible to create a new VM from the restored disks.
If the publisher doesn't have any Marketplace information, you can attach the restored disk(s) (that were created during partial failure) as data disks to an existing VM.
ExtensionConfigParsingFailure - Failure in parsing the config for the backup extension
Error code: ExtensionConfigParsingFailureError message: Failure in parsing the config for the backup extension.
This error happens because of changed permissions on theMachineKeysdirectory:%systemdrive%\programdata\microsoft\crypto\rsa\machinekeys.
Run the following command and verify that permissions on theMachineKeysdirectory are default ones:icacls %systemdrive%\programdata\microsoft\crypto\rsa\machinekeys.
icacls %systemdrive%\programdata\microsoft\crypto\rsa\machinekeys
Default permissions are as follows:
Everyone: (R,W)
BUILTIN\Administrators: (F)
If you see permissions in theMachineKeysdirectory that are different than the defaults, follow these steps to correct permissions, delete the certificate, and trigger the backup:
Fix permissions on theMachineKeysdirectory. By using Explorer security properties and advanced security settings in the directory, reset permissions back to the default values. Remove all user objects except the defaults from the directory and make sure theEveryonepermission has special access as follows:List folder/read dataRead attributesRead extended attributesCreate files/write dataCreate folders/append dataWrite attributesWrite extended attributesRead permissions

ExtensionFailedTimeoutVMNetworkUnresponsive - Snapshot operation failed due to inadequate VM resources
Error code: ExtensionFailedTimeoutVMNetworkUnresponsiveError message: Snapshot operation failed due to inadequate VM resources.
The backup operation on the VM failed due to delay in network calls while performing the snapshot operation. To resolve this issue, perform Step 1. If the issue persists, try steps 2 and 3.
Step 1:Create snapshot through Host
From an elevated (admin) command-prompt, run the following command:
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v SnapshotMethod /t REG_SZ /d firstHostThenGuest /f
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v CalculateSnapshotTimeFromHost /t REG_SZ /d True /f
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v SnapshotMethod /t REG_SZ /d firstHostThenGuest /f
REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgentPersistentKeys" /v CalculateSnapshotTimeFromHost /t REG_SZ /d True /f
This will ensure the snapshots are taken through host instead of Guest. Retry the backup operation.
Step 2:Try changing the backup schedule to a time when the VM is under less load (like less CPU or IOPS)
Step 3:Tryincreasing the size of the VMand retry the operation
320001, ResourceNotFound - Could not perform the operation as VM no longer exists / 400094, BCMV2VMNotFound - The virtual machine doesn't exist / An Azure virtual machine wasn't found
Error code: 320001, ResourceNotFoundError message: Could not perform the operation as VM no longer exists.Error code: 400094, BCMV2VMNotFoundError message: The virtual machine doesn't existAn Azure virtual machine wasn't found.
This error happens when the primary VM is deleted, but the backup policy still looks for a VM to back up. To fix this error, take the following steps:
Re-create the virtual machine with the same name and same resource group name,cloud service name,or
Stop protecting the virtual machine with or without deleting the backup data. For more information, seeStop protecting virtual machines.
UserErrorBCMPremiumStorageQuotaError - Could not copy the snapshot of the virtual machine, due to insufficient free space in the storage account
Error code: UserErrorBCMPremiumStorageQuotaErrorError message: Could not copy the snapshot of the virtual machine, due to insufficient free space in the storage account
For premium VMs on VM backup stack V1, we copy the snapshot to the storage account. This step makes sure that backup management traffic, which works on the snapshot, doesn't limit the number of IOPS available to the application using premium disks.We recommend that you allocate only 50 percent, 17.5 TB, of the total storage account space. Then the Azure Backup service can copy the snapshot to the storage account and transfer data from this copied location in the storage account to the vault.
380008, AzureVmOffline - Failed to install Microsoft Recovery Services extension as virtual machine  is not running
Error code: 380008, AzureVmOfflineError message: Failed to install Microsoft Recovery Services extension as virtual machine  is not running

UserErrorRequestDisallowedByPolicy - An invalid policy is configured on the VM which is preventing Snapshot operation
Error code:  UserErrorRequestDisallowedByPolicyError message: An invalid policy is configured on the VM which is preventing Snapshot operation.
If you have an Azure Policy thatgoverns tags within your environment, either consider changing the policy from aDeny effectto aModify effect, or create the resource group manually according to thenaming schema required by Azure Backup.
UserErrorUnableToOpenMount
Error code: UserErrorUnableToOpenMount
Cause: Backups failed because the backup extensions on the VM were unable to open the mount points in the VM.
Recommended action: The backup extension on the VM must be able to access all mount points in the VM to determine the underlying disks, take snapshot, and calculate the size. Ensure that all mount points are accessible.

Backup or restore takes time
If your backup takes more than 12 hours, or restore takes more than 6 hours, reviewbest practices, andperformance considerations
VM Agent
Set up the VM Agent
Typically, the VM Agent is already present in VMs that are created from the Azure gallery. But virtual machines that are migrated from on-premises datacenters won't have the VM Agent installed. For those VMs, the VM Agent needs to be installed explicitly.
Download and install theagent MSI. You need Administrator privileges to finish the installation.
For virtual machines created by using the classic deployment model,update the VM propertyto indicate that the agent is installed. This step isn't required for Azure Resource Manager virtual machines.
Install the latest version of the agent from the distribution repository. For details on the package name, see theLinux Agent repository.
For VMs created by using the classic deployment model,update the VM propertyand verify that the agent is installed. This step isn't required for Resource Manager virtual machines.
Update the VM Agent
To update the VM Agent, reinstall theVM Agent binaries. Before you update the agent, make sure no backup operations occur during the VM Agent update.
To update the Linux VM Agent, follow the instructions in the articleUpdating the Linux VM Agent.NoteAlways use the distribution repository to update the agent.Don't download the agent code from GitHub. If the latest agent isn't available for your distribution, contact the distribution support for instructions to acquire the latest agent. You can also check the latestWindows Azure Linux agentinformation in the GitHub repository.
To update the Linux VM Agent, follow the instructions in the articleUpdating the Linux VM Agent.
Note
Always use the distribution repository to update the agent.
Don't download the agent code from GitHub. If the latest agent isn't available for your distribution, contact the distribution support for instructions to acquire the latest agent. You can also check the latestWindows Azure Linux agentinformation in the GitHub repository.
Validate VM Agent installation
Verify the VM Agent version on Windows VMs:
Sign in to the Azure virtual machine and navigate to the folderC:\WindowsAzure\Packages. You should find theWaAppAgent.exefile.
Right-click the file and go toProperties. Then select theDetailstab. TheProduct Versionfield should be 2.6.1198.718 or higher.
Troubleshoot VM snapshot issues
VM backup relies on issuing snapshot commands to underlying storage. Not having access to storage or delays in a snapshot task run can cause the backup job to fail. The following conditions can cause snapshot task failure:
VMs with SQL Server backup configured can cause snapshot task delay. By default, VM backup creates a VSS full backup on Windows VMs. VMs that run SQL Server, with SQL Server backup configured, can experience snapshot delays. If snapshot delays cause backup failures, set following registry key:REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\BcdrAgent" /v UseVssFullBackup /t REG_SZ /d True /fNoteFrom December 12, 2022, Azure VM backup automatically sets the registry key in the existing protected Azure VMs that are registered as SQL VMs. Now, you don't need  to explicitly set this registry key. This ensures that snapshots aren't delayed and any log chains managed by other backup products are also not broken. Azure VM backup now also set the registry key in any new SQL VMs automatically during the configuration of backup.

VM status is reported incorrectly because the VM is shut down in RDP. If you used the remote desktop to shut down the virtual machine, verify that the VM status in the portal is correct. If the status isn't correct, use theShutdownoption in the portal VM dashboard to shut down the VM.

If more than four VMs share the same cloud service, spread the VMs across multiple backup policies. Stagger the backup times, so no more than four VM backups start at the same time. Try to separate the start times in the policies by at least an hour.

The VM runs at high CPU or memory. If the virtual machine runs at high memory or CPU usage, more than 90 percent, your snapshot task is queued and delayed. Eventually it times out. If this issue happens, try an on-demand backup.

Networking
DHCP must be enabled inside the guest for IaaS VM backup to work. If you need a static private IP, configure it through the Azure portal or PowerShell. Make sure the DHCP option inside the VM is enabled.
