Azure Virtual Network Manager provides a few different ways for you to verify if configurations are being applied correctly. In this article, we look at how you can verify configurations applied both at virtual network and virtual machine level. We'll also go over operations you'll see in the activity log.
Virtual network visibility
Effective network group membership and applied configurations can be viewed on the per virtual network level.
Network group membership
All network group memberships are recorded and available for query insideAzure Resource Graph. You are using thenetworkResourcestable for the extension resource type ofMicrosoft.Network/networkGroupMembershipsin your query.
networkResources
Microsoft.Network/networkGroupMemberships
Open theAzure portalto find and use the Resource Graph Explorer with the following steps:
SelectAll servicesin the left pane. Search for and selectResource Graph Explorer, or connect directly to theResource Graph Explorer

In theQuery 1portion of the window, enter the following query to find all network groups containing your virtual network:networkresources
| where type == "microsoft.network/networkgroupmemberships"
| where id == "{virtualNetworkId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkGroupMemberships/default"
| mv-expand properties.GroupMemberships
| project properties_GroupMemberships.NetworkGroupId

SelectRun query.
SelectRun query.
Review the query response in theResultstab. Select theMessagestab to see details about the query, including the count of results and duration of the query. Errors, if any, are displayed under this tab.

To find all resources inside your network group, repeat steps above with the following query:networkresources
| where type == "microsoft.network/networkgroupmemberships"
| mv-expand properties.GroupMemberships
| where properties_GroupMemberships.NetworkGroupId == {networkGroupId}
| parse id with virtualNetworkId "/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkGroupMemberships/default"
|    project virtualNetworkId

Note
Azure Resource Graph will only return networking resources you have read access to at the time of running the query.
Applied configurations
Once your configuration has been deployed by Virtual Network Manager, you can view the applied configuration from the virtual network resource.
Go to your virtual network resource and selectNetwork ManagerunderSettings. On the Connectivity tab, view all the connectivity configurations the virtual network is associated with.

Virtual machine visibility
At the virtual machine level, you can view security rules applied by Virtual Network Manager and the effective routes for the connectivity configurations.
Applied security rules
Go to a virtual machine in a virtual network that has a configuration applied by Virtual Network Manager. Then selectNetworkingunderSettingson the left menu pane.

Routes with the next hop type ofConnectedGroupare either part of mesh configuration or whenDirect connectivityis enabled for a network group. Routes between the hub and spoke virtual networks will appear as next hop typeVNetPeeringorGlobalVNetPeering.NoteThe hub virtual network address space is alsoincludedin theConnectedGroup. Therefore, if virtual network peering fails between the hub and spoke virtual networks, they can still communicate with each other because they're in a connected group.

Activity Log
You can view the activity log for your Azure Virtual Network Manager resource to see the changes that you or your network administrator have made. To view the activity log, go to your Network Manager resource in the Azure portal. SelectActivity login the left pane menu. If necessary, adjust theTimespanand add more filters to narrow the list of operations. You can also view theActivity Logby searching for the service at the top of the Azure portal.
