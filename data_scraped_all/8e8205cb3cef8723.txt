Azure Key Vault Managed HSM is a cloud-based hardware security module that protects cryptographic keys. Because Managed HSM is often used to safeguard highly sensitive or business-critical data, it's vital to secure access to your HSMs, configure them according to security best practices, and monitor them for threats.
This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure Key Vault Managed HSM deployment.
Network security
Network security covers protecting Managed HSM with secure network connectivity, private endpoints, and network access controls. It helps reduce the exposure of your HSM to public networks and ensures that only authorized traffic is allowed.
Deploy private endpoints using Azure Private Link: Use private endpoints to establish private, secured connectivity to your Managed HSM instance, prevent exposure to the public internet, and reduce attack vectors. For more information, seeIntegrate Managed HSM with Azure Private Link.
Deploy private endpoints using Azure Private Link: Use private endpoints to establish private, secured connectivity to your Managed HSM instance, prevent exposure to the public internet, and reduce attack vectors. For more information, seeIntegrate Managed HSM with Azure Private Link.
Disable public network access: Prevent access to the service from public IP addresses by disabling public network access in the Managed HSM configuration. For more information, seeIntegrate Managed HSM with Azure Private Link.

Identity management
Identity management focuses on securing authentication and identity access to your Managed HSM resources. Microsoft Entra provides a centralized identity solution for managing access to the HSM's management and data planes.
Require Microsoft Entra authentication for data plane access: Microsoft Entra is used by default for authenticating data plane operations in Managed HSM, enabling centralized and secure identity control. For more information, seeMicrosoft Entra authentication.

Use security groups for administrative access: Assign the HSM Administrator role to aMicrosoft Entra security groupinstead of individual users. This reduces the risk of accidental lockout if a user account is deleted. For guidance, seeAccess control for Managed HSM.

Privileged access
Privileged access emphasizes securing administrative actions and enforcing least-privilege access principles to reduce the risk of unauthorized or excessive permissions.
Lock down access to subscriptions and resource groups: Use Azure RBAC to control administrative access at the management group, subscription, and resource group levels. For guidance, seeAzure RBAC overview.

Use least-privilege access principles when assigning roles: Grant only the minimum set of permissions required. Regularly review role assignments. For more information, seeManaged HSM role management.

Avoid assigning multiple roles to the same identity: Maintain separation of duties by ensuring a single user or identity isn't assigned conflicting roles. For more information, seeAccess control for Managed HSM.

Logging and threat detection
Logging and threat detection help you monitor access and operations on your Managed HSM, enabling you to detect suspicious activity and ensure compliance with security policies.
Enable audit logging: Configure diagnostic settings to enable audit logging for your Managed HSM. Logs capture all authenticated REST API requests, key operations, and security domain actions. Logs can be sent to an Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace, or Event Hubs. For more information, seeManaged HSM logging.
