Increase regional vCPU quotas

Azure Resource Manager enforces two types of vCPU quotas for virtual machines:
standard vCPU quotas
spot vCPU quotas
Standard vCPU quotas apply to pay-as-you-go VMs and reserved VM instances. They're enforced at two tiers, for each subscription, in each region:
The first tier is the total regional vCPU quota.
The second tier is the VM-family vCPU quota such as D-series vCPUs.
This article shows how to request regional vCPU quota increases for all VMs in a given region. You can also request increases forVM-family vCPU quotasorspot vCPU quotas.
Special considerations
When considering your vCPU needs across regions, keep in mind the following:
Regional vCPU quotas are enforced across all VM series in a given region. As a result, decide how many vCPUs you need in each region in your subscription. If you don't have enough vCPU quota in each region, submit a request to increase the vCPU quota in that region. For example, if you need 30 vCPUs in West Europe and you don't have enough quota, specifically request a quota for 30 vCPUs in West Europe. When you do so, the vCPU quotas in your subscription in other regions aren't increased. Only the vCPU quota limit in West Europe is increased to 30 vCPUs.

When you request an increase in the vCPU quota for a VM series, Azure increases the regional vCPU quota limit by the same amount.
When you request an increase in the vCPU quota for a VM series, Azure increases the regional vCPU quota limit by the same amount.
When you create a new subscription, the default value for the total number of vCPUs in a region might not be equal to the total default vCPU quota for all individual VM series. This can result in a subscription without enough quota for each individual VM series that you want to deploy. However, there might not be enough quota to accommodate the total regional vCPUs for all deployments. In this case, you must submit a request to explicitly increase the quota limit of the regional vCPU quotas.

Request an increase for regional vCPU quotas
To request quota increases, you must have an Azure account with the Contributor role (or another role that includes Contributor access).

This option allows you to select one usage percentage to apply to all the selected quotas without requiring you to calculate an absolute number (limit) for each quota.

If you selectedEnter a new limit: In theNew Quota Requestpane, enter a numerical value for each new quota limit.
If you selectedAdjust the usage %: In theNew Quota Requestpane, adjust the slider to a new usage percent. Adjusting the percentage automatically calculates the new limit for each quota to be increased. This option is particularly useful when the selected quotas have very high usage.
