Azure Container Registry service tiers

Azure Container Registry is available in multiple service tiers (also known as SKUs). These tiers provide predictable pricing and several options for aligning to the capacity and usage patterns of your private Docker registry in Azure.
The Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers all provide the same programmatic capabilities. They also all benefit fromimage storagemanaged entirely by Azure. Choosing a higher-level tier provides more performance and scale. With multiple service tiers, you can get started with Basic, then convert to Standard and Premium as your registry usage increases.
For example :
If you purchase a Basic tier registry, it includes a storage of 10 GB. The price you pay here is $0.167 per day. Prices are calculated based on US dollars.
If you have a Basic tier registry and use 25 GB storage, you are paying $0.003/day*15 = $0.045 per day for the additional 15 GB.
So, the pricing for the Basic ACR with 25 GB storage is $0.167+$0.045= 0.212 USD per day with other related charges like networking, builds, etc, according to thePricing - Container Registry.
Service tier features and limits
The following table details the features and registry limits of the Basic, Standard, and Premium service tiers.
1Storage included in the daily rate for each tier. Additional storage may be used, up to the registry storage limit, at an additional daily rate per GiB. For rate information, seeAzure Container Registry pricing. If you need storage beyond the registry storage limit, please contact Azure Support.
2ReadOps,WriteOps, andBandwidthare minimum estimates. Azure Container Registry strives to improve performance as usage requires. Both resources, ACR, and the device must be in the same region to achieve a fast download speed.
3Adocker pulltranslates to multiple read operations based on the number of layers in the image, plus the manifest retrieval.
4Adocker pushtranslates to multiple write operations, based on the number of layers that must be pushed. Adocker pushincludesReadOpsto retrieve a manifest for an existing image.

Registry throughput and throttling
Throughput
When generating a high rate of registry operations, use the service tier's limits for read and write operations and bandwidth as a guide for expected maximum throughput. These limits affect data-plane operations including listing, deleting, pushing, and pulling images and other artifacts.
To estimate the throughput of image pulls and pushes specifically, consider the registry limits and these factors:
Number and size of image layers
Reuse of layers or base images across images
additional API calls that might be required for each pull or push
For details, see documentation for theDocker HTTP API V2.
When evaluating or troubleshooting registry throughput, also consider the configuration of your client environment:
your Docker daemon configuration for concurrent operations
your network connection to the registry's data endpoint (or endpoints, if your registry isgeo-replicated).
If you experience issues with throughput to your registry, seeTroubleshoot registry performance.
Pushing a single 133 MBnginx:latestimage to an Azure container registry requires multiple read and write operations for the image's five layers:
nginx:latest
Read operations to read the image manifest, if it exists in the registry
Write operations to write the configuration blob of the image
Write operations to write the image manifest
Throttling
You may experience throttling of pull or push operations when the registry determines the rate of requests exceeds the limits allowed for the registry's service tier. You may see an HTTP 429 error similar toToo many requests.
Too many requests
Throttling could occur temporarily when you generate a burst of image pull or push operations in a very short period, even when the average rate of read and write operations is within registry limits. You may need to implement retry logic with some backoff in your code or reduce the maximum rate of requests to the registry.
Show registry usage
Use theaz acr show-usagecommand in the Azure CLI,Get-AzContainerRegistryUsagein Azure PowerShell, or theList UsagesREST API, to get a snapshot of your registry's current consumption of storage and other resources, compared with the limits for that registry's service tier. Storage usage also appears on the registry'sOverviewpage in the portal.
Usage information helps you make decisions aboutchanging the service tierwhen your registry nears a limit. This information also helps youmanage consumption.
Note
The registry's storage usage should only be used as a guide and may not reflect recent registry operations. Monitor the registry'sStorageUsed metricfor up-to-date data.
Depending on your registry's service tier, usage information includes some or all of the following, along with the limit in that tier:
Storage consumed in bytes1
Number ofwebhooks
Number ofgeo-replications(includes the home replica)
Number ofprivate endpoints
Number ofIP access rules
Number ofvirtual network rules
1In a geo-replicated registry, storage usage is shown for the home region. Multiply by the number of replications for total storage consumed.
Changing tiers
You can change a registry's service tier with the Azure CLI or in the Azure portal. You can move freely between tiers as long as the tier you're switching to has the required maximum storage capacity.
There is no registry downtime or impact on registry operations when you move between service tiers.
Azure CLI
To move between service tiers in the Azure CLI, use theaz acr updatecommand. For example, to switch to Premium:
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --sku Premium
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --sku Premium
Azure PowerShell
To move between service tiers in Azure PowerShell, use theUpdate-AzContainerRegistrycmdlet. For example, to switch to Premium:
Update-AzContainerRegistry -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myContainerRegistry -Sku Premium
Update-AzContainerRegistry -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myContainerRegistry -Sku Premium
Azure portal
In the container registryOverviewin the Azure portal, selectUpdate, then select a newSKUfrom the SKU drop-down.
