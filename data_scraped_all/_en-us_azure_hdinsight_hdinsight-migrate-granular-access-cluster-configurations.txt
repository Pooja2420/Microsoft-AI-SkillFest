We are introducing some important changes to support more fine-grained role-based access to obtain sensitive information. As part of these changes, some action may be requiredby September 3, 2019if you are using one of theaffected entities/scenarios.
What is changing?
Previously, secrets could be obtained via the HDInsight API by cluster users
possessing the Owner, Contributor, or ReaderAzure
roles, as they were available to anyone with the*/readpermission. Secrets are defined as values that could be used to obtain more elevated access than a user's role should allow. These include values such as cluster gateway HTTP credentials, storage account keys, and database credentials.
*/read
Beginning on September 3, 2019, accessing these secrets will require theMicrosoft.HDInsight/clusters/configurations/actionpermission, user cannot access it with the Reader role. The roles that have this permission are Contributor, Owner, and the new HDInsight Cluster Operator role.
Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters/configurations/action
We are also introducing a newHDInsight Cluster Operatorrole that able to retrieve secrets without being granted the administrative permissions of Contributor or Owner. To summarize:
For information on how to add the HDInsight Cluster Operator role assignment to a user to grant them read/write access to cluster secrets, see the below section,Add the HDInsight Cluster Operator role assignment to a user.

Add the HDInsight Cluster Operator role assignment to a user
A user with theOwnerrole can assign theHDInsight Cluster Operatorrole to users that you would want to have read/write access to sensitive HDInsight cluster configuration values (such as cluster gateway credentials and storage account keys).
Using the Azure CLI
The simplest way to add this role assignment is by using theaz role assignment createcommand in Azure CLI.
az role assignment create
Note
This command must be run by a user with the Owner role, as only they can grant these permissions. The--assigneeis the name of the service principal or email address of the user to whom you want to assign the HDInsight Cluster Operator role. If you receive an insufficient permissions error, see the FAQ.
--assignee
az role assignment create --role "HDInsight Cluster Operator" --assignee <user@domain.com> --scope /subscriptions/<SubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters/<ClusterName>
az role assignment create --role "HDInsight Cluster Operator" --assignee <user@domain.com> --scope /subscriptions/<SubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters/<ClusterName>
az role assignment create --role "HDInsight Cluster Operator" --assignee user@domain.com -g <ResourceGroupName>
az role assignment create --role "HDInsight Cluster Operator" --assignee user@domain.com -g <ResourceGroupName>
az role assignment create --role "HDInsight Cluster Operator" --assignee user@domain.com
az role assignment create --role "HDInsight Cluster Operator" --assignee user@domain.com
Using the Azure portal
You can alternatively use the Azure portal to add the HDInsight Cluster Operator role assignment to a user. See the documentation,Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
FAQ
Why am I seeing a 403 (Forbidden) response after updating my API requests and/or tool?
Cluster configurations are now behind granular role-based access control and require theMicrosoft.HDInsight/clusters/configurations/*permission to access them. To obtain this permission, assign the HDInsight Cluster Operator, Contributor, or Owner role to the user or service principal trying to access configurations.
Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters/configurations/*
Why do I see "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation" when running the Azure CLI command to assign the HDInsight Cluster Operator role to another user or service principal?
In addition to having the Owner role, the user or service principal executing the command needs to have sufficient Microsoft Entra permissions to look up the object IDs of the assignee. This message indicates insufficient Microsoft Entra permissions. Try replacing the-âassigneeargument withâassignee-object-idand provide the object ID of the assignee as the parameter instead of the name (or the principal ID in the case of a managed identity). See the optional parameters section of theaz role assignment create documentationfor more info.
-âassignee
âassignee-object-id
If it still does not work, contact your Microsoft Entra admin to acquire the correct permissions.
What will happen if I take no action?
Beginning on September 3, 2019,GET /configurationsandPOST /configurations/gatewaycalls will no longer return any information and theGET /configurations/{configurationName}call will no longer return sensitive parameters, such as storage account keys or the cluster password. The same is true of corresponding SDK methods and PowerShell cmdlets.
GET /configurations
POST /configurations/gateway
GET /configurations/{configurationName}
If you are using an older version of one of the tools for Visual Studio, VS Code, IntelliJ or Eclipse mentioned, it is no longer function until you update.
For more detailed information, see the corresponding section of this document for your scenario.
