Overview
TheOverviewsection provides you with basic information about your cache, such as name, ports, pricing tier, and selected cache metrics.
Activity log
SelectActivity logto view actions done to your cache. You can also use filtering to expand this view to include other resources. For more information on working with audit logs, seeAudit operations with Resource Manager. For more information on monitoring the activity log, seeActivity log.
Access control (IAM)
TheAccess control (IAM)section provides support for Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) in the Azure portal. This configuration helps organizations meet their access management requirements simply and precisely. For more information, seeAzure role-based access control in the Azure portal.
Tags
TheTagssection helps you organize your resources. For more information, seeUsing tags to organize your Azure resources.
Diagnose and solve problems
SelectDiagnose and solve problemsto be provided with common issues and strategies for resolving them.
Events
SelectEventsto add event subscriptions to your cache. Use events to build reactive, event-driven apps with the fully managed event routing service that is built into Azure.
The Event Grid helps you build automation into your cloud infrastructure, create serverless apps, and integrate across services and clouds. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Event Grid.
Redis console
You can securely issue commands to your Azure Cache for Redis instances using theRedis Console, which is available in the Azure portal for Basic, Standard and Premium cache tiers.
Important
The Redis Console does't work when a cache has any of the following:
Virtual Network. When your cache is part of a VNet, only clients in the VNet can access the cache. Because Redis Console runs in your local browser, which is outside the VNet, it can't connect to your cache.
Private Link
Access Keys disabled
Note
To access Redis Console, you would need at leastContributorbuilt-in role.
To access the Redis Console, selectConsoletab in the working pane of Resource menu.

To issue commands against your cache instance, type the command you want into the console.

Note
Not all Redis commands are supported in Azure Cache for Redis. For a list of Redis commands that are disabled for Azure Cache for Redis, seeRedis commands not supported in Azure Cache for Redissection.
For more information about Redis commands, seehttps://redis.io/commands.
Using the Redis Console with a premium clustered cache
When using the Redis Console with a premium clustered cache, you can issue commands to a single shard of the cache. To issue a command to a specific shard, first connect to the shard you want by selecting it on the shard picker.

If you attempt to access a key that is stored in a different shard than the connected shard, you receive an error message similar to the following message:
shard1>get myKey
(error) MOVED 866 13.90.202.154:13000 (shard 0)
shard1>get myKey
(error) MOVED 866 13.90.202.154:13000 (shard 0)
shard1>get myKey
(error) MOVED 866 13.90.202.154:13000 (shard 0)
shard1>get myKey
(error) MOVED 866 13.90.202.154:13000 (shard 0)
In the previous example, shard 1 is the selected shard, butmyKeyis located in shard 0, as indicated by the(shard 0)portion of the error message. In this example, to accessmyKey, select shard 0 using the shard picker, and then issue the desired command.
myKey
(shard 0)
myKey
Move your cache to a new subscription
You can move your cache to a new subscription by selectingMove.

For information on moving resources from one resource group to another, and from one subscription to another, seeMove resources to new resource group or subscription.

Authentication
You have two options for authentication: access keys and Microsoft Entra Authentication.
Access keys
Microsoft Entra Authentication
SelectAccess keysto view or regenerate the access keys for your cache. These keys are used by the clients connecting to your cache.

SelectMicrosoft Entra Authenticationto  a password-free authentication mechanism by integrating with Microsoft Entra ID. This integration also includes role-based access control functionality provided through access control lists (ACLs) supported in open source Redis.

Advanced settings
The following settings are configured on theAdvanced settingson the left.
Access Ports
Memory policies
Keyspace notifications (advanced settings)
By default, non-TLS/SSL access is disabled for new caches. To enable the non-TLS port, SelectNoforAllow access only via SSLon theAdvanced settingson the left and then SelectSave.
Note
TLS access to Azure Cache for Redis supports TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 currently, but versions 1.0 and 1.1 are being retired soon. Please read ourRemove TLS 1.0 and 1.1 pagefor more details.

Use theMaxmemory policy,maxmemory-reserved, andmaxfragmentationmemory-reservedsettings fromAdvanced settingsfrom the Resource menu on the left to configure the memory policies for the cache. When you create a cache, the valuesmaxmemory-reservedandmaxfragmentationmemory-reserveddefault to 10% ofmaxmemory, which is the cache size.
maxmemory-reserved
maxfragmentationmemory-reserved
maxmemory

Maxmemory policyconfigures the eviction policy for the cache and allows you to choose from the following eviction policies:
volatile-lru: The default eviction policy. It removes the least recently used key out of all the keys with an expiration set.
volatile-lru
allkeys-lru: Removes the least recently used key.
allkeys-lru
volatile-random: Removes a random key that has an expiration set.
volatile-random
allkeys-random: Removes a random key.
allkeys-random
volatile-ttl: Removes the key with the shortest time to live based on the expiration set for it.
volatile-ttl
noeviction: No eviction policy. Returns an error message if you attempt to insert data.
noeviction
volatile-lfu: Evicts the least frequently used keys out of all keys with an expire field set.
volatile-lfu
allkeys-lfu: Evicts the least frequently used keys out of all keys.
allkeys-lfu
For more information aboutmaxmemorypolicies, seeEviction policies.
maxmemory
Themaxmemory-reservedsetting configures the amount of memory in MB per instance in a cluster that is reserved for noncache operations, such as replication during failover. Setting this value allows you to have a more consistent Redis server experience when your load varies. This value should be set higher for workloads that write large amounts of data. When memory is reserved for such operations, it's unavailable for storage of cached data. The minimum and maximum values on the slider are 10% and 60%, shown in megabytes. You must set the value in that range.
Themaxfragmentationmemory-reservedsetting configures the amount of memory in MB per instance in a cluster that is reserved to accommodate for memory fragmentation. When you set this value, the Redis server experience is more consistent when the cache is full or close to full and the fragmentation ratio is high. When memory is reserved for such operations, it's unavailable for storage of cached data. The minimum and maximum values on the slider are 10% and 60%, shown in megabytes. You must set the value in that range.
When choosing a new memory reservation value (maxmemory-reservedormaxfragmentationmemory-reserved), consider how this change might affect a cache that is already running with large amounts of data in it. For instance, if you have a 53-GB cache with 49 GB of data, then change the reservation value to 8 GB, this change drops the max available memory for the system down to 45 GB. If either your currentused_memoryor yourused_memory_rssvalues are higher than the new limit of 45 GB, then the system has to evict data until bothused_memoryandused_memory_rssare below 45 GB. Eviction can increase server load and memory fragmentation. For more information on cache metrics such asused_memoryandused_memory_rss, seeCreate your own metrics.

Important
Keyspace notifications and thenotify-keyspace-eventssetting are only available for Standard and Premium caches.
For more information, seeRedis Keyspace Notifications. For sample code, see theKeySpaceNotifications.csfile in theHello worldsample.
Scale
SelectScaleto view or change the pricing tier for your cache. For more information on scaling, seeHow to Scale Azure Cache for Redis.

Cluster Size
SelectCluster Sizeto change the cluster size for a running premium cache with clustering enabled.

To change the cluster size, use the slider or type a number between 1 and 10 in theShard counttext box. Then, selectOKto save.
Data persistence
SelectData persistenceto enable, disable, or configure data persistence for your premium cache. Azure Cache for Redis offers Redis persistence using either RDB persistence or AOF persistence.
For more information, seeHow to configure persistence for a Premium Azure Cache for Redis.
Important
Redis data persistence is for Premium caches, Enterprise caches (Preview), and Enterprise Flash caches (Preview).
Identity
UseIdentityto configure managed identities. Managed identities are a common tool used in Azure to help developers minimize the burden of managing secrets and sign-in information.
Presently, you can only use managed identities for storage. For more information, seeManaged identity for storage.
Note
Managed identity functionality is only available in the Premium tier for use with storage.
Schedule updates
TheSchedule updatessection allows you to choose a maintenance window for Redis server updates for your cache.
Important
The maintenance window applies only to Redis server updates, and not to any Azure updates or updates to the operating system of the VMs that host the cache.

To specify a maintenance window, check the days you want. Then, specify the maintenance window start hour for each day, and selectOK. The maintenance window time is in UTC.
For more information and instructions, seeUpdate channel and Schedule updates.
Geo-replication
Geo-replication, on the Resource menu, provides a mechanism for linking two Premium tier Azure Cache for Redis instances. One cache is named as the primary linked cache, and the other as the secondary linked cache. The secondary linked cache becomes read-only, and data written to the primary cache is replicated to the secondary linked cache. This functionality can be used to replicate a cache across Azure regions.
Important
Geo-replicationis only available for Premium tier caches. For more information and instructions, seeHow to configure Geo-replication for Azure Cache for Redis.
Virtual Network
TheVirtual Networksection allows you to configure the virtual network settings for your cache. Virtual networks are limited to Premium caches. For information on creating a premium cache with VNET support and updating its settings, seeHow to configure Virtual Network Support for a Premium Azure Cache for Redis.
Important
Virtual network settings are only available for premium caches that were configured with VNet support during cache creation.
Private endpoint
ThePrivate Endpointsection allows you to configure the private endpoint settings for your cache. Private endpoint is supported on all cache tiers Basic, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise. We recommend using private endpoint instead of VNets. Private endpoints are easy to set up or remove, are supported on all tiers, and can connect your cache to multiple different VNets at once.
For more information, seeAzure Cache for Redis with Azure Private Link.
Firewall
Firewall rules configuration is available for all Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers.
Firewall rules configuration isn't available for Enterprise nor Enterprise Flash tiers.
SelectFirewallto view and configure firewall rules for cache.

You can specify firewall rules with a start and end IP address range. When firewall rules are configured, only client connections from the specified IP address ranges can connect to the cache. When a firewall rule is saved, there's a short delay before the rule is effective. This delay is typically less than one minute.
Important
Connections from Azure Cache for Redis monitoring systems are always permitted, even if firewall rules are configured.
Properties
SelectPropertiesto view information about your cache, including the cache endpoint and ports.

Locks
TheLockssection allows you to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. For more information, seeLock resources with Azure Resource Manager.
Administration settings
The settings in theAdministrationsection allow you to perform the following administrative tasks for your cache.

Import data
Export data
Reboot
Import/Export
Import/Export is an Azure Cache for Redis data management operation that allows you to import and export data in the cache. You can import and export an Azure Cache for Redis Database (RDB) snapshot from a premium cache to a page blob in an Azure Storage Account. Use Import/Export to migrate between different Azure Cache for Redis instances or populate the cache with data before use.
You can use import with Redis-compatible RDB files from any Redis server running in any cloud or environment:
including Redis running on Linux
Windows
any cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services and others
Importing data is an easy way to create a cache with prepopulated data. During the import process, Azure Cache for Redis loads the RDB files from Azure storage into memory, and then inserts the keys into the cache.
Export allows you to export the data stored in Azure Cache for Redis to Redis compatible RDB files. You can use this feature to move data from one Azure Cache for Redis instance to another or to another Redis server. During the export process, a temporary file is created on the VM that hosts the Azure Cache for Redis server instance. The temporary file is uploaded to the designated storage account. When the export operation completes with either a status of success or failure, the temporary file is deleted.
Important
Import/Export is only available for Premium tier caches. For more information and instructions, seeImport and Export data in Azure Cache for Redis.
Reboot
TheRebootitem allows you to reboot the nodes of your cache. This reboot capability enables you to test your application for resiliency if there's a failure of a cache node.

If you have a premium cache with clustering enabled, you can select which shards of the cache to reboot.

To reboot one or more nodes of your cache, select the desired nodes and selectReboot. If you have a premium cache with clustering enabled, select the shards to reboot, and then selectReboot. After a few minutes, the selected node(s) reboot, and are back online a few minutes later.
Important
Reboot is not yet available for the Enterprise tier. Reboot is available for all other tiers. For more information and instructions, seeAzure Cache for Redis administration - Reboot.
Monitoring
TheMonitoringsection allows you to configure diagnostics and monitoring for your Azure Cache for Redis instance.
For more information on Azure Cache for Redis monitoring and diagnostics, seeMonitor Azure Cache for Redis.
For information on how to set up and use Azure Cache for Redis monitoring and diagnostics, seeMonitor Azure Cache for Redis.

P5: (120 GB - 1200 GB) - up to 40,000 connections
Note
While each size of cache allowsup toa certain number of connections, each connection to Redis has overhead associated with it. An example of such overhead would be CPU and memory usage as a result of TLS/SSL encryption. The maximum connection limit for a given cache size assumes a lightly loaded cache. If load from connection overheadplusload from client operations exceeds capacity for the system, the cache can experience capacity issues even if you have not exceeded the connection limit for the current cache size.
