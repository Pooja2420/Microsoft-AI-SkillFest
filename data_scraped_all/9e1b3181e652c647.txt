Deploy a DHCP server in Azure on a virtual machine
Article

Learn how to deploy a highly available DHCP server in Azure on a virtual machine. This server is used as a target for an on-premises DHCP relay agent to provide dynamic IP address allocation to on-premises clients. Broadcast packets directly from clients to a DHCP Server don't work in an Azure Virtual Network by design.
Note
The on-premises client to DHCP Server (source port UDP/68, destination port UDP/67) is still not supported in Azure, since this traffic is intercepted and handled differently. This will result in timeout messages at the time of DHCP RENEW at T1 when the client directly attempts to reach the DHCP Server in Azure. The DHCP RENEW will succeed when the DHCP RENEW attempt is made at T2 via DHCP Relay Agent. For more details on the T1 and T2 DHCP RENEW timers, seeRFC 2131.

In theAzure Bastionsection, selectEnable Azure Bastion.Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses. The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Bastion?.NoteHourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Next step
In this article, you learned how to deploy a highly available DHCP server in Azure on a virtual machine. You also learned how to configure the network adapters and installed the DHCP role on the virtual machines. Further configuration of the DHCP server is required to provide DHCP services to on-premises clients from the Azure Virtual Machines. The DHCP relay agent on the on-premises network must be configured to forward DHCP requests to the DHCP servers in Azure. Consult the manufacturer's documentation for the DHCP relay agent for configuration steps.
