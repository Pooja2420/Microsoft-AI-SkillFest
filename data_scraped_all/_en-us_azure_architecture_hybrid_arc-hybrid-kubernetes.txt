Azure Arc hybrid management and deployment for Kubernetes clusters
This reference architecture describes how Azure Arc extends Kubernetes cluster management and configuration across customer datacenters, edge locations, and multiple cloud environments.
Architecture

This architecture diagram shows various Azure services and their functionalities. Two icons that represent Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters are in a section that's labeled on-premises. Four icons that represent Azure Monitor, Azure Policy, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are in a section that's labeled Azure. The AKS icon appears two times. Arrows indicate a connection between the Azure section and the two Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters in the on-premises section. Arrows also indicate a connection between Azure Policy, the clusters in both the on-premises and Azure sections, and Azure Monitor.

Recommendations
You can apply the following recommendations to most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.
Cluster registration
You can register any active CNCF Kubernetes cluster. You need akubeconfigfile to access the cluster and a cluster-admin role on the cluster to deploy Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes agents. Use the Azure CLI to perform cluster registration tasks. The user or service principal that you use for theaz loginandaz connectedk8s connectcommands requires Read and Write permissions on theMicrosoft.Kubernetes/connectedClustersresource type. The Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding role has these permissions and can be used for role assignments on either the user principal or the service principal. Helm 3 is required to onboard the cluster that uses theconnectedk8sextension. The Azure CLI version 2.3 or later is required to install the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes CLI extensions.

Monitor clusters by using Azure Monitor container insights
Monitoring your containers is crucial. Azure Monitor container insights provides robust monitoring capabilities for AKS and AKS engine clusters. You can also configure Azure Monitor container insights to monitor Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters that are hosted outside of Azure. This configuration provides comprehensive monitoring of your Kubernetes clusters across Azure, on-premises, and in non-Microsoft cloud environments.
Azure Monitor container insights provides performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers. These metrics are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API. Container logs are also collected. After you enable monitoring from Kubernetes clusters, a containerized version of the Log Analytics agent automatically collects metrics and logs. Metrics are written to the metrics store, and log data is written to the logs store that's associated with your Log Analytics workspace. For more information, seeAzure Monitor features for Kubernetes monitoring.
You can enable Azure Monitor container insights for one or more deployments of Kubernetes by using a PowerShell script or a Bash script.
For more information, seeEnable monitoring for Kubernetes clusters.
Use Azure Policy to enable GitOps-based application deployment
Use Azure Policy to make sure that each GitOpsâenabledMicrosoft.Kubernetes/connectedclustersresource orMicrosoft.ContainerService/managedClustersresource has specificMicrosoft.KubernetesConfiguration/fluxConfigurationsapplied on it. For example, you can apply a baseline configuration to one or more clusters, or deploy specific applications to multiple clusters. To use Azure Policy, choose a definition from theAzure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetesand then create a policy assignment. When you create the policy assignment, set the scope to an Azure resource group or subscription. Also set the parameters for thefluxConfigurationthat's created. When the assignment is created, the Azure Policy engine identifies allconnectedClusterormanagedClusterresources that are in scope and then applies thefluxConfigurationto each resource.

If you use multiple source repositories for each cluster, such as one repository for the central IT or cluster operator and other repositories for application teams, activate this feature by using multiple policy assignments and configure each policy assignment to use a different source repository.
For more information, seeDeploy applications consistently at scale by using Flux v2 configurations and Azure Policy.
Deploy applications by using GitOps
GitOps is the practice of defining the desired state of Kubernetes configurations, such as deployments and namespaces, in a source repository. This repository can be a Git or Helm repository, Buckets, or Azure Blob Storage. This process is followed by a polling and pull-based deployment of these configurations to the cluster by using an operator.
The connection between your cluster and one or more source repositories is enabled by deploying themicrosoft.fluxextension to your cluster. ThefluxConfigurationresource properties represent where and how Kubernetes resources should flow from the source repository to your cluster. ThefluxConfigurationdata is stored encrypted at rest in an Azure Cosmos DB database to help ensure data confidentiality.

Theflux-configagent that runs in your cluster monitors for new or updatedfluxConfigurationextension resources on the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource, deploys applications from the source repository, and propagates all updates that are made to thefluxConfiguration. You can create multiplefluxConfigurationresources by using thenamespacescope on the same Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster to achieve multi-tenancy.

namespace
The source repository can contain any valid Kubernetes resources, including Namespaces, ConfigMaps, Deployments, and DaemonSets. It can also contain Helm charts for deploying applications. Common source repository scenarios include defining a baseline configuration for your organization that can include common RBAC roles and bindings, monitoring agents, logging agents, and cluster-wide services.
You can also manage a larger collection of clusters that are deployed across heterogeneous environments. For example, you can have one repository that defines the baseline configuration for your organization, and then apply that configuration to multiple Kubernetes clusters simultaneously. You can also deploy applications to a cluster from multiple source repositories.
For more information, seeDeploy applications by using GitOps with Flux v2.
Run Machine Learning
In Machine Learning, you can choose an AKS (or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes) cluster as a compute target for your machine learning processes. This capability enables you to train or deploy machine learning models in your own, self-hosted (or multicloud) infrastructure. This approach allows you to combine your on-premises investments on GPUs with the ease of management that Machine Learning provides in the cloud.
Monitor Kubernetes workloads with managed Prometheus and Grafana
Azure Monitor provides a managed service for both Prometheus and Grafana deployments, so that you can take advantage of these popular Kubernetes monitoring tools. This managed service allows you to use these tools without the need to manage and update the deployments yourself. To analyze Prometheus' metrics, use themetrics explorer with PromQL.
Topology, network, and routing
Azure Arc agents require the following protocols, ports, and outbound URLs to function.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability helps ensure that your application can meet the commitments that you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
In most scenarios, the location that you choose when you create the installation script should be the Azure region that's geographically closest to your on-premises resources. The rest of the data is stored within the Azure geography that contains the region you specify. This detail might affect your choice of region if you have data residency requirements. If an outage affects the Azure region that your machine is connected to, the outage doesn't affect the connected machine, but management operations that use Azure might not complete. If you have multiple locations that provide a geographically redundant service, connect the machines in each location to a different Azure region. This practice improves resiliency if a regional outage occurs. For more information, seeSupported regions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.
