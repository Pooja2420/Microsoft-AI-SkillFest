Enable recommended alert rules in the Azure portal
You cancreate a new alert rule, or enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules in the Azure portal.
The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:
The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
Data that tells us what customers commonly alert on for this resource.
Note
The alert rule recommendations feature is enabled for:
Virtual machines
AKS resources
Log Analytics workspaces

To enable recommended alert rules:
