Control access
Provide the minimum necessarypermissionsandaccess levelsto ensure that only authorized individuals and services can access sensitive information and perform critical actions. This practice helps to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
Regularly review and update these settings to adapt to changes in your organization, such as role changes, new hires, or departures. Implementing a periodicauditof permissions and access levels can help identify and rectify any discrepancies, ensuring that your security posture remains robust and aligned with best practices.
Scope permissions
To ensure secure and efficient management of permissions, properly scope permissions within your Azure DevOps environment. Scoping permissions involves defining and assigning the appropriate level of access to users and groups based on their roles and responsibilities. This practice helps to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches by ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information and critical actions.
To scope permissions effectively, do the following actions:
Disable inheritance:Avoid inheritance, preventing unintended access. Inheritance can inadvertently grant permissions to users who shouldn't have them, due to its allow-by-default nature. Carefully manage and explicitly set permissions to ensure that only the intended users have access. For more information, seePermissions inheritance.
Segment environments:Use separate Azure accounts for different environments, such as Development, Testing, and Production, to enhance security and prevent conflicts. This approach minimizes the risk of resource conflicts and data contamination between environments and allows for better management and isolation of resources. For more information, seeAzure Landing Zone.
Control access and ensure compliance:Use Azure Policy to restrict access to unused Azure regions and services, ensuring compliance with organizational standards. This action helps enforce best practices and maintain a secure environment by preventing unauthorized access and usage. For more information, see theAzure Policy overview.
Implement Azure role-based control (ABAC):Use ABAC with properly tagged resources, limiting unauthorized access. This action ensures that access permissions get granted based on specific attributes, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized resource creation and access. For more information, seeImplement Azure role-based control (ABAC).
Use security groups:Use security groups to efficiently manage permissions for multiple users. This method simplifies granting and revoking access compared to assigning permissions individually and ensures consistency and easier management across your organization.Use Microsoft Entra ID, Active Directory, or Windows security groups when you're managing lots of users.Take advantage of built-in roles and default to Contributor for developers. Admins get assigned to the Project Administrator security group for elevated permissions, allowing them to configure security permissions.Keep groups as small as possible, restricting access.For more information, seeManage security groups.

Choose the right authentication method
When you're choosing the appropriate authentication method for your Azure DevOps environment, consider the security and management benefits of different options. Using secure authentication methods helps protect your resources and ensures that only authorized users and services can access your Azure DevOps environment. Consider using service principals, managed identities, and Microsoft Entra to enhance security and streamline access management.
Use service principals:Represent security objects within a Microsoft Entra application. Define what an application can do in a given tenant. Set up during application registration in the Azure portal. Configure to access Azure resources, including Azure DevOps. Useful for apps needing specific access and control.
Use managed identities:Similar to an applicationâs service principal. Provide identities for Azure resources. Allow services supporting Microsoft Entra authentication to share credentials. Azure handles credential management and rotation automatically. Ideal for seamless sign-in details management.
Use Microsoft Entra ID:Create a single plane for identity by connecting Azure DevOps to Microsoft Entra ID. This consistency reduces confusion and minimizes security risks from manual configuration errors.Access your organization with Microsoft Entra IDand assign different roles and permissions to specific groups across various resource scopes. This action implements fine-grained governance, ensures controlled access, and aligns with security best practices.UseConditional Access Policies, which define access rules based on conditions likelocation, device, or risk level.

Manage external guest access
To ensure the security and proper management of external guest access, implement specific measures that control and monitor how external users interact with your Azure DevOps environment. External guest access can introduce potential security risks if not managed properly. By following these actions, you can minimize these risks and ensure that external guests have the appropriate level of access without compromising the security of your environment.
Block external guest access:Disable the"Allow invitations to be sent to any domain" policyto prevent external guest access if there's no business need for it.
Use distinct emails or UPNs:Use different email addresses or user principal names (UPNs) for personal and business accounts to eliminate ambiguity between personal and work-related accounts.
Group external guest users:Place all external guest users in a single Microsoft Entra group andmanage permissions for this group appropriately. Remove direct assignments to ensure group rules apply to these users.
Reevaluate rules regularly:Regularly review rules on the Group rules tab of the Users page. Consider any group membership changes in Microsoft Entra ID that might affect your organization. Microsoft Entra ID can take up to 24 hours to update dynamic group membership, and rules are automatically reevaluated every 24 hours and whenever a group rule changes.
For more information, seeB2B guests in the Microsoft Entra ID.
Implement Zero Trust
To enhance security, adopt Zero Trust principles across your DevOps processes. This approach ensures that every access request is thoroughly verified, regardless of its origin. Zero Trust operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify," meaning that no entity, whether inside or outside the network, is trusted by default. By implementing Zero Trust, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure that only authorized users and devices can access your resources.
Embrace the Zero Trust approach:ImplementZero Trustprinciples to fortify yourDevOps platform, safeguard yourdevelopment environment, and integrate Zero Trust seamlessly into yourdeveloper workflows. Zero Trust helps to protect against lateral movement within the network, ensuring that even if there's a compromised part of the network, the threat is contained and can't spread.
For more information, see theZero Trust Assessment guide.
Remove users
To ensure that only active and authorized users have access to your Azure DevOps environment, regularly review and manage user access. Removing inactive or unauthorized users helps maintain a secure environment and reduces the risk of potential security breaches. By following these actions, you can ensure that your Azure DevOps environment remains secure and that only the necessary individuals have access.
Remove inactive users from Microsoft accounts (MSAs):Directly remove inactive users from your organization if they're using MSAs. You can't create queries for work items assigned to removed MSA accounts. For more information, seeRemove users from your organization.
Disable or delete Microsoft Entra user accounts:If connected to Microsoft Entra ID, disable or delete the Microsoft Entra user account while keeping the Azure DevOps user account active. This action allows you to continue querying work item history using your Azure DevOps user ID.
Revoke user PATs:Ensure secure management of these critical authentication tokens by regularly reviewing and revoking any existing user PATs. For more information, seeRevoke user PATs for administrators.
Revoke special permissions granted to individual users:Audit and revoke any special permissions granted to individual users to ensure alignment with the principle of least privilege.
Reassign work from removed users:Before removing users, reassign their work items to current team members to distribute the load effectively.
Scope service accounts
Service accounts are used to run automated processes and services, and they often have elevated permissions. By properly scoping and managing service accounts, you can minimize security risks and ensure that these accounts are used appropriately.
Create single-purpose service accounts:Each service should have its dedicated account to minimize risk. Avoid using regular user accounts asservice accounts.
Use Azure Resource Manager:Authenticate with Azure resources using workload identity federation with either an app registration or managed identity instead of using an app registration with a secret. For more information, seeUse Azure Resource Manager.
Identify and disable unused service accounts:Regularly review and identify accounts no longer in use. Disable unused accounts before considering deletion.
Restrict privileges:Limit service account privileges to the minimum necessary. Avoid interactive sign-in rights for service accounts.
Use separate identities for report readers:If using domain accounts for service accounts, use a different identity for report readers toisolate permissions and prevent unnecessary access.
Use local accounts for workgroup installations:When installing components in a workgroup, use local accounts for user accounts. Avoid domain accounts in this scenario.
Use service connections:Use service connections whenever possible to securely connect to services without passing secret variables directly to builds. Restrict connections to specific use cases. for more information, see theScope service connectionssection in this article.
Monitor service account activity:Implement auditing and createaudit streamsto monitor service account activity.
Scope service connections
To ensure secure and efficient access to Azure resources, properly scope service connections. Service connections allow Azure DevOps to connect to external services and resources, and by scoping these connections, you can limit access to only the necessary resources and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
Limit access:Limit access by scoping yourAzure Resource Managerservice connections to specific resources and groups. Don't grant broad contributor rights across the entire Azure subscription.
Use Azure Resource Manager:Authenticate with Azure resources using workload identity federation with either an app registration or managed identity instead of using an app registration with a secret. For more information, seeCreate an Azure Resource Manager service connection that uses workload identity federation.
Scope resource groups:Ensure resource groups contain only the Virtual Machines (VMs) or resources needed for the build process.
Avoid classic service connections:Opt for modern Azure Resource Manager service connections instead of classic ones, which lack scoping options.
Use purpose-specific team service accounts:Authenticate service connections using purpose-specific team service accounts to maintain security and control.
For more information, seeCommon service connection types.
Enable and review auditing events
To enhance security and monitor usage patterns within your organization, enable and regularly review auditing events. Auditing helps track user actions, permissions changes, and security incidents, allowing you to identify and address potential security issues promptly.
Enable auditing:Track and view events related to user actions, permissions, changes, and security incidents. For more information, seeEnable or disable auditing.
Review audit events regularly:Regularly review audit logs to monitor user activities and detect any suspicious behavior. Look for unexpected usage patterns, especially by administrators and other users. This action helps identify potential security breaches and takes corrective actions. For more information, seeReview audit logandAuditing events.
Configure security alerts:Configure alerts to notify you of any security incidents or policy violations. This action ensures timely response to potential threats.
Protect your data
To ensure the security and integrity of your data, implement data protection measures. Protecting your data involves encryption, backup, and recovery strategies to safeguard against data loss and unauthorized access.
Protect your data:Protect your data by using encryption, backup, and recovery strategies. For more information, seeData protection.
