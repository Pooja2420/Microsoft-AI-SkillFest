Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU is an AI-enabled edge computing device with network data transfer capabilities. This article provides you an overview of the Azure Stack Edge Pro solution, benefits, key capabilities, and scenarios where you can deploy this device. The article also explains the pricing model for your device.
Azure Stack Edge Pro with GPU is a Hardware-as-a-Service solution. Microsoft ships you a cloud-managed device that acts as a network storage gateway. A built-in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) enables accelerated AI-inferencing.
Use cases
Here are the various scenarios where Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU can be used for rapid Machine Learning (ML) inferencing at the edge and preprocessing data before sending it to Azure.
Inference with Azure Machine Learning- With Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU, you can run ML models to get quick results that can be acted on before the data is sent to the cloud. The full data set can optionally be transferred to continue to retrain and improve your ML models. For more information, see how to useDeploy Azure Machine Learning hardware accelerated models on Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU.

Preprocess data- Transform data before sending it to Azure via compute options such as containerized workloads and Virtual Machines to create a more actionable dataset. Preprocessing can be used to:Aggregate data.Modify data, for example to remove personal data.Subset data to optimize storage and bandwidth, or for further analysis.Analyze and react to IoT Events.

Components
The Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU solution includes the Azure Stack Edge resource, Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU physical device, and a local web UI.
Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU physical device- A 1U rack-mounted server supplied by Microsoft that can be configured to send data to Azure.To procure a device, go to the Azure Edge Hardware Center and place an order. Azure Edge Hardware Center service lets you choose from a variety of Azure Stack Edge SKUs as per your business need. You can order multiple units of a device type, ship multiple devices to different locations, save addresses for future orders, and also track the status of your orders.Once the order is delivered, you can configure your device and create an Azure Stack Edge resource to manage the device.For more information, go toCreate an order for your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device.The devices can be deployed as a single node or a two-node cluster. For more information, seeWhat is clustering for Azure Stack Edge?and how toDeploy a two-node cluster.

Azure Stack Edge resourceâ A resource in the Azure portal that lets you manage an Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device from a web interface that you can access from different geographical locations. Use the Azure Stack Edge resource to create and manage resources, view, and manage devices and alerts, and manage shares.

Region availability
Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU physical device, Azure resource, and target storage account to which you transfer data donât all have to be in the same region.
Resource availability- For this release, the resource is available in East US, West EU, and South East Asia regions.

Destination Storage accounts- The storage accounts that store the data are available in all Azure regions. For best performance, the regions where the storage accounts store Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU data should be close to the device location. A storage account located far from the device results in long latencies and slower performance.

Billing model
The users are charged a monthly, recurring subscription fee for an Azure Stack Edge device. In addition, thereâs a onetime fee for shipping. Thereâs no on-premises software license for the device although guest virtual machine (VMs) may require their own licenses under Bring Your Own License (BYOL).
Currency conversion and discounts are handled centrally by the Azure Commerce billing platform, and you get one unified, itemized bill at the end of each month.
Standardstorage rates and transaction feesare charged separately as applicable. Monthly subscription fee billing starts after delivery whether the appliance is activated or not.
The billing happens against the order resource. If you activate the device against a different resource, the order and billing details move to the new resource.
