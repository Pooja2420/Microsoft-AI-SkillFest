Many permissions get set at the project level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to theProject Administratorsgroup. Or, you can grant specific project-level permissions to a custom security group or to a user.
Consider adding users to theProject Administratorsgroup when they're tasked with adding or managing teams, area and iteration paths, repositories, service hooks, and service end points.
Project-level permissions
The following table lists the permissions assigned at the project-level. All of these permissions are granted to members of theProject Administratorsgroup, except for theDelete shared Analytics viewsandEdit shared Analytics viewspermissions which are not set. For a description of each permission, seePermissions and groups reference, Groups.
Note
Permissions associated with Analytics requires that the Inherited process model is selected for an on-premises project collection.

Note
The permission to add or remove project-level security groups and add and manage project-level group membership is assigned to all members of theProject Administratorsgroup. It isn't controlled by a permission surfaced within the user interface.
Create tag definition permission
By default, members of theContributorsgroup are assigned theCreate tag definitionpermission. Although theCreate tag definitionpermission appears in the security settings at the project-level, tagging permissions are actually collection-level permissions that are scoped at the project level when they appear in the user interface. To scope tagging permissions to a single project when using a command-line tool, you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax. Otherwise, your change applies to the entire collection. For more information, seeSecurity groups, service accounts, and permissions, Work item tags.

Users grantedStakeholderaccess can't access select features even if granted permissions to those features. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.

Add members to the Project Administrators group
You can add users who are associated with a project, organization, or collection to the Project Administrators group. This group has specific permissions at the organizations or collection level. To add a custom security group, first create the group as described inAdd or remove users or groups, manage security groups.
Here we show how to add a user to the built-inProject Administratorsgroup. The method is similar to adding a Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory group.

You can modify project-level permissions for any group associated with a project, except for theProject Administratorsgroup. Also, each team that is added to a project is automatically included as a project-level group. To add security groups to a project, seeAdd or remove users or groups, manage security groups.
