Azure Artifacts provides developers with a streamlined way to manage all their dependencies from a single feed. These feeds serve as repositories for storing, managing, and sharing packages, whether within your team, across organizations, or publicly online.
Azure Artifacts supports multiple package types, including NuGet, npm, Python, Maven, Cargo, and Universal Packages.
Note
Azure Artifacts provides 2 GiB of free storage for each organization. This free tier is designed to help you evaluate if Azure Artifacts fits your workflow. As your organization starts handling more critical tasks,increase the storage limit for Azure Artifactsto ensure you have the appropriate resources.
Prerequisites
Create a new feed
Azure Artifacts feeds are organizational constructs that enable you to store, manage, and share your packages while maintaining access control. Feeds are not limited to specific package types; you can store a variety of packages, such as npm, NuGet, Maven, Python, Cargo, and Universal Packages in a single feed. SeeWhat are feedsfor more details.
Follow the instructions below to create a new feed:
Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.

Feature availability
View Artifacts storage consumption
The artifact storage UI, accessible through your organization or project settings, lets you monitor storage usage at both the organization and project levels:
Project-level storage: Provides an overview of total storage usage and consumption by artifact type.

Increase Azure Artifacts storage limit
Azure Artifacts provides 2 GiB of free storage for each organization. When your organization reaches the maximum storage limit, publishing new artifacts will no longer be possible. To continue, you can either delete some of your existing artifacts or follow these steps to increase your storage limit:
Set up billing for your organization.
Set up billing for your organization.
Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, selectOrganization settings>Billing, and adjust your Artifacts usage limit by selectingNo limit, pay for what you usefrom the dropdown menu.

FAQs
A: You are charged for all package types (npm, NuGet, Python, Maven, Cargo, and Universal Packages), including packages stored from upstream sources. However, there are no charges for Pipeline Artifacts and Pipeline Caching.
Important
Packages in the recycle bin contribute to your overall storage consumption. These packages are permanently deleted after 30 days. To remove them sooner, go to your recycle bin and delete them manually.
A: Removing your Azure Subscription from your Azure DevOps organization limits your access to the free tier. If your storage usage exceeds 2 GiB, you will have read-only access to packages. To publish new packages, you must reduce your storage usage below 2 GiB. Alternatively, you can reconnect an Azure subscription to your organization and set up billing toupgrade your storage tier.
A: The smallest unit of measurement for storage is currently 1 GiB. It's likely that your storage usage hasn't yet surpassed the 1-GiB threshold.
A: Deleting artifacts may not be immediately reflected in the system. Storage consumption typically updates within 24 hours, but in some cases, it may take up to 48 hours. If you're unable to upload artifacts, a temporary workaround is to increase your usage level and then decrease it once the storage metrics are updated.
TheUsedcolumn on your organization's billing page is updated once a day, so changes may not be reflected right away. However, theArtifact Storagepage is updated more frequently, which could result in a slight discrepancy between the two pages.

A: You can set up the retention policies to automatically delete old packages. However, that are promoted to a view are not affected by retention policies and will not be deleted. SeeHow to use retention policies to delete old packagesfor more details.
A: SeeDelete and recover packagesfor details.
