Design great API developer experiences using API Management and GitHub
As the publisher of APIs, you need a website that effectively markets your APIs and helps customers to differentiate between offerings. When they've selected APIs, you need to be able to give access only to authenticated users, manage consumption, and deliver accurate invoices for use. This example scenario shows how you can use Azure service and GitHub to create a platform that does all of this and more.
