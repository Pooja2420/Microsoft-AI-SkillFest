Successful communication between a virtual machine (VM) and an endpoint such as another VM, can be critical for your organization. Sometimes, configuration changes break communication.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network
Create two virtual machines
Monitor communication between the two virtual machines
Diagnose a communication problem between the two virtual machines

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.
Create a virtual network
In this section, you createmyVNetvirtual network with two subnets and an Azure Bastion host. The first subnet is used for the virtual machine, and the second subnet is used for the Bastion host.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the search box at the top of the portal, entervirtual networks. SelectVirtual networksfrom the search results.
In the search box at the top of the portal, entervirtual networks. SelectVirtual networksfrom the search results.

Create two virtual machines
In this section, you create two virtual machines:myVM1andmyVM2to test the connection between them.
Create the first virtual machine
In the search box at the top of the portal, entervirtual machine. SelectVirtual machinesfrom the search results.

Create the second virtual machine
Repeat the steps in the previous section to create the second virtual machine and entermyVM2for the virtual machine name.
Create a connection monitor
In this section, you create a connection monitor to monitor communication over TCP port 3389 frommyVm1tomyVm2.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enternetwork watcher. SelectNetwork Watcher.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enternetwork watcher. SelectNetwork Watcher.
