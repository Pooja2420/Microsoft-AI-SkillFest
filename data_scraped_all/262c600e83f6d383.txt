Azure DNS Private Resolver
This article presents a solution for using Azure DNS Private Resolver to simplify hybrid recursive Domain Name System (DNS) resolution. You can use DNS Private Resolver for on-premises workloads and Azure workloads. DNS Private Resolver simplifies private DNS resolution from on-premises to the Azure private DNS service and vice versa.
Architecture
The following sections present alternatives for hybrid recursive DNS resolution. The first section discusses a solution that uses a DNS forwarder virtual machine (VM). Subsequent sections explain how to use DNS Private Resolver.
Use a DNS forwarder VM
Before DNS Private Resolver was available, a DNS forwarder VM was deployed so that an on-premises server could resolve requests to the Azure private DNS service. The following diagram illustrates the details of this name resolution. A conditional forwarder on the on-premises DNS server forwards requests to Azure, and a private DNS zone is linked to a virtual network. Requests to the Azure service then resolve to the appropriate private IP address.
In this solution, you can't use the Azure public DNS service to resolve on-premises domain names.

Use DNS Private Resolver
When you use DNS Private Resolver, you don't need a DNS forwarder VM, and Azure DNS is able to resolve on-premises domain names.
The following solution uses DNS Private Resolver in ahub-spoke network topology. As a best practice, the Azure landing zone design pattern recommends using this type of topology. A hybrid network connection is established by usingAzure ExpressRouteandAzure Firewall. This setup provides asecure hybrid network. DNS Private Resolver is deployed into a spoke network (denoted as the Shared Service Network in the diagrams throughout this article).

The solution that uses DNS Private Resolver contains the following components:
An on-premises network. This network of customer datacenters is connected to Azure via ExpressRoute or a site-to-site Azure VPN Gateway connection. Network components include two local DNS servers. One uses the IP address 192.168.0.1. The other uses 192.168.0.2. Both servers work as resolvers or forwarders for all computers inside the on-premises network.
An administrator creates all local DNS records and Azure endpoint forwarders on these servers. Conditional forwarders are configured on these servers for the Azure Blob Storage and Azure API Management services. Those forwarders send requests to the DNS Private Resolver inbound connection. The inbound endpoint uses the IP address 10.0.0.8 and is hosted within the Shared Service virtual network (subnet 10.0.0.0/28).
The following table lists the records on the local servers.
App1.onprem.company.com
App2.onprem.company.com
blob.core.windows.net

Scenario details
Azure offers various DNS solutions:
Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains. By default, Azure virtual networks use Azure DNS for DNS resolution. Microsoft manages and maintains Azure DNS.
Azure Traffic Manager acts as a DNS-based load balancing service. It provides a way to distribute traffic across Azure regions to public-facing applications.
The Azure private DNS service provides a DNS service for virtual networks. You can use Azure private DNS service zones to resolve your own domain names and VM names without having to configure a custom solution and without modifying your own configuration. During deployment, you can use custom domain names instead of names that Azure provides if you use private DNS zones.
DNS Private Resolver is a cloud-native, highly available, DevOps-friendly service. It provides a straightforward, zero-maintenance, reliable, and secure DNS service. You can use this service to resolve DNS names that are hosted in Azure DNS private zones from on-premises networks. You can also use the service for DNS queries for your own domain names.
Before DNS Private Resolver was available, you had to use custom DNS servers for DNS resolution from on-premises systems to Azure and vice versa. Custom DNS solutions have many disadvantages:
Managing multiple custom DNS servers for multiple virtual networks involves high infrastructure and licensing costs.
You have to handle all aspects of installing, configuring, and maintaining DNS servers.
Overhead tasks, such as monitoring and patching these servers, are complex and prone to failure.
There's no DevOps support for managing DNS records and forwarding rules.
It's expensive to implement scalable DNS server solutions.
DNS Private Resolver overcomes these obstacles by providing the following features and key advantages:
A fully managed Microsoft service with built-in high availability and zone redundancy.
A scalable solution that works well with DevOps.
Cost savings when compared with traditional infrastructure as a service (IaaS)âbased custom solutions.
Conditional forwarding for Azure DNS to on-premises servers. The outbound endpoint provides this capability, which wasn't available in the past. Workloads in Azure no longer require direct connections to on-premises DNS servers. Instead, the Azure workloads connect to the outbound IP address of DNS Private Resolver.
Potential use cases
This solution simplifies private DNS resolution in hybrid networks. It applies to many scenarios:
Transition strategies during long-term migration to fully cloud-native solutions
Disaster recovery and fault tolerance solutions that replicate data and services between on-premises and cloud environments
Solutions that host components in Azure to reduce latency between on-premises datacenters and remote locations

Traditionally, DNS records map a DNS name to an IP address. For example,www.contoso.comresolves to 42.3.10.170. With reverse DNS, the mapping goes in the opposite direction. An IP address is mapped back to a name. For example, the IP address 42.3.10.170 resolves towww.contoso.com.
www.contoso.com
www.contoso.com
For detailed information about Azure support for reverse DNS and how reverse DNS works, seeOverview of reverse DNS and support in Azure.
DNS Private Resolver has the following limitations:
DNS Private Resolver rule sets can only be linked to virtual networks that are within the same geographical region as the resolver.
A virtual network can't contain more than one DNS private resolver.
You need to assign a dedicated subnet to each inbound and outbound endpoint.
