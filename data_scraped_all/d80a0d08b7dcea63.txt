Queries sent to Kusto may include a set of name or value pairs. The pairs are calledquery parameters, together with the query text itself. The query may reference one or more values, by specifying names and type, in aquery parameters declaration statement.
Query parameters have two main uses:
As a protection mechanism against injection attacks.
As a way to parameterize queries.
In particular, client applications that combine user-provided input in queries that they then send to Kusto should use the mechanism to protect against the Kusto equivalent ofSQL Injectionattacks.
Declaring query parameters
To reference query parameters, the query text, or functions it uses, must first declare which query parameter it uses. For each parameter, the declaration provides the name and scalar type. Optionally, the parameter can also have a default value. The default is used if the request doesn't provide a concrete value for the parameter. Kusto then parses the query parameter's value, according to its normal parsing rules for that type.
Syntax
declarequery_parameters(Name1:Type1[=DefaultValue1] [,...]);
declare

Note
Likeuser defined functions, query parameters of typedynamiccannot have default values.
dynamic
Let, set, and tabular statements are strung together/separated by a semicolon, otherwise they will not be considered part of the same query.
Example
The examples in this section show how to use the syntax to help you get started.
The examples in this article use publicly available tables in thehelp cluster, such as theStormEventstable in theSamplesdatabase.
StormEvents
The examples in this article use publicly available tables, such as theStormEventstable in the Weather analyticssample data.
StormEvents
Declare query parameters
This query retrieves storm events from theStormEventstable where the total number of direct and indirect injuries exceeds a specified threshold (default is 90). It then projects theEpisodeId,EventType, and the total number of injuries for each of these events.
Run the query
declare query_parameters(maxInjured:long = 90);
StormEvents 
| where InjuriesDirect + InjuriesIndirect > maxInjured
| project EpisodeId, EventType, totalInjuries = InjuriesDirect + InjuriesIndirect
declare query_parameters(maxInjured:long = 90);
StormEvents 
| where InjuriesDirect + InjuriesIndirect > maxInjured
| project EpisodeId, EventType, totalInjuries = InjuriesDirect + InjuriesIndirect
Output
Specify query parameters in a client application
The names and values of query parameters are provided asstringvalues
by the application making the query. No name may repeat.
string
The interpretation of the values is done according to the query parameters
declaration statement. Every value is parsed as if it were a literal in the
body of a query. The parsing is done according to the type specified by the query parameters
declaration statement.
REST API
Query parameters are provided by client applications through thepropertiesslot of the request body's JSON object, in a nested property bag calledParameters. For example, here's the body of a REST API call to Kusto
that calculates the age of some user, presumably by having the application
ask for the user's birthday.
