Running tests, especially automated ones, generates lots of data.
To keep your test system responsive and performing well,
have a policy to clear test results that you don't need anymore.
Delete automated test results when you delete your builds.
You can keep manual test results while you're still reviewing them,
for example, up to a year.
Prerequisites

Set retention period for test results
To delete manual test results after a specific number of days,
set the retention limit at the project level.
Azure DevOps keeps manual test results related to builds,
even after you delete those builds. That way, build policies don't delete
your test results before you can analyze the data.

Set retention policy for automated test results associated with builds
By default, Azure DevOps keeps automated test results related to builds
only as long as you keep those builds. To keep test results after you delete your builds,
edit the build retention policy. If you use Git for version control,
you can specify how long to keep automated test results based on the branch.

Set retention policy for automated test results not associated with builds
Clean up automated test results left over from deleted builds or test results that aren't related to builds. For example, results published from external test systems. Set the retention limits at the project level as described inSet retention period for test resultsearlier in this article.
