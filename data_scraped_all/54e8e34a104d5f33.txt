Apply security and kernel updates to Linux nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

To protect your clusters, security updates are automatically applied to Linux nodes in AKS. These updates include OS security fixes or kernel updates. Some of these updates require a node reboot to complete the process. AKS doesn't automatically reboot these Linux nodes to complete the update process.
The process to keep Windows Server nodes up to date is a little different. Windows Server nodes don't receive daily updates. Instead, you perform an AKS upgrade that deploys new nodes with the latest base Window Server image and patches. For AKS clusters that use Windows Server nodes, seeUpgrade a node pool in AKS.
This article shows you how to use the open-sourcekured (KUbernetes REboot Daemon)to watch for Linux nodes that require a reboot, then automatically handle the rescheduling of running pods and node reboot process.
Note
Kuredis an open-source project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Please direct issues to thekured GitHub. Additional support can be found in the #kured channel onCNCF Slack.

Important
Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.
For example, theRay GitHub repositorydescribes several platforms that vary in response time, purpose, and support level.
Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, seeVulnerability management for AKSandAKS support coverage.
Before you begin
You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Runaz --versionto find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure CLI.
az --version
Understand the AKS node update experience
In an AKS cluster, your Kubernetes nodes run as Azure virtual machines (VMs). These Linux-based VMs use an Ubuntu or Azure Linux image, with the OS configured to automatically check for updates every day. If security or kernel updates are available, they're automatically downloaded and installed.

Some security updates, such as kernel updates, require a node reboot to finalize the process. A Linux node that requires a reboot creates a file named/var/run/reboot-required. This reboot process doesn't happen automatically.
You can use your own workflows and processes to handle node reboots, or usekuredto orchestrate the process. Withkured, aDaemonSetis deployed that runs a pod on each Linux node in the cluster. These pods in the DaemonSet watch for existence of the/var/run/reboot-requiredfile, and then initiate a process to reboot the nodes.

Node image upgrades
Unattended upgrades apply updates to the Linux node OS, but the image used to create nodes for your cluster remains unchanged. If a new Linux node is added to your cluster, the original image is used to create the node. This new node receives all the security and kernel updates available during the automatic check every day but remains unpatched until all checks and restarts are complete.
Alternatively, you can use node image upgrade to check for and update node images used by your cluster. For more information on node image upgrade, seeAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node image upgrade.
Node upgrades
There's another process in AKS that lets youupgradea cluster. An upgrade is typically to move to a newer version of Kubernetes, not just apply node security updates. An AKS upgrade performs the following actions:
A new node is deployed with the latest security updates and Kubernetes version applied.
An old node is cordoned and drained.
Pods are scheduled on the new node.
The old node is deleted.
You can't remain on the same Kubernetes version during an upgrade event. You must specify a newer version of Kubernetes. To upgrade to the latest version of Kubernetes, you canupgrade your AKS cluster.
Deploy kured in an AKS cluster
To deploy thekuredDaemonSet, install the following official Kured Helm chart. This creates a role and cluster role, bindings, and a service account, then deploys the DaemonSet usingkured.
kured
kured
# Add the Kured Helm repository
helm repo add kubereboot https://kubereboot.github.io/charts/

# Update your local Helm chart repository cache
helm repo update

# Create a dedicated namespace where you would like to deploy kured into
kubectl create namespace kured

# Install kured in that namespace with Helm 3 (only on Linux nodes, kured is not working on Windows nodes)
helm install my-release kubereboot/kured --namespace kured --set controller.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
# Add the Kured Helm repository
helm repo add kubereboot https://kubereboot.github.io/charts/

# Update your local Helm chart repository cache
helm repo update

# Create a dedicated namespace where you would like to deploy kured into
kubectl create namespace kured

# Install kured in that namespace with Helm 3 (only on Linux nodes, kured is not working on Windows nodes)
helm install my-release kubereboot/kured --namespace kured --set controller.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
You can also configure extra parameters forkured, such as integration with Prometheus or Slack. For more information about configuration parameters, see thekured Helm chart.

Update cluster nodes
By default, Linux nodes in AKS check for updates every evening. If you don't want to wait, you can manually perform an update to check thatkuredruns correctly. First, follow the steps toSSH to one of your AKS nodes. Once you have an SSH connection to the Linux node, check for updates and apply them as follows:
kured
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
If updates were applied that require a node reboot, a file is written to/var/run/reboot-required.Kuredchecks for nodes that require a reboot every 60 minutes by default.
Kured
Monitor and review reboot process
When one of the replicas in the DaemonSet detects that a node reboot is required, a lock is placed on the node through the Kubernetes API. This lock prevents more pods from being scheduled on the node. The lock also indicates that only one node should be rebooted at a time. With the node cordoned off, running pods are drained from the node, and the node is rebooted.
You can monitor the status of the nodes using thekubectl get nodescommand. The following example output shows a node with a status ofSchedulingDisabledas the node prepares for the reboot process:
NAME                       STATUS                     ROLES     AGE       VERSION
aks-nodepool1-28993262-0   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   agent     1h        v1.11.7
NAME                       STATUS                     ROLES     AGE       VERSION
aks-nodepool1-28993262-0   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   agent     1h        v1.11.7
Once the update process is complete, you can view the status of the nodes using thekubectl get nodescommand with the--output wideparameter. This output lets you see a difference inKERNEL-VERSIONof the underlying nodes, as shown in the following example output. Theaks-nodepool1-28993262-0was updated in a previous step and shows kernel version4.15.0-1039-azure. The nodeaks-nodepool1-28993262-1that hasn't been updated shows kernel version4.15.0-1037-azure.
