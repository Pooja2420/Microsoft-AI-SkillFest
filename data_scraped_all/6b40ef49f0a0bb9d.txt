GitHub Actionshelps you automate your software development workflows from within GitHub. You can deploy workflows in the same place where you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues.
In GitHub Actions, aworkflowis an automated process that you set up in your GitHub repository. You can build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub with a workflow.
Each workflow is made up of individualactionsthat run after a specific event (like a pull request) occur. The individual actions are packaged scripts that automate software development tasks.
With GitHub Actions for Azure, you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, and deploy to Azure. GitHub Actions for Azure supports Azure services, including Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Key Vault.
GitHub Actions also include support for utilities, including Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure CLI, and Azure Policy.
