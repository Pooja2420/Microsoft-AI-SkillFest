Microsoft Defender for Cloud includes endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities to improve security posture for supported machines. Defender for Cloud:
Integrates natively with Defender for Endpoint as an EDR solutionfor machine protection. to provide EDR capabilities for protected machines.
Scans connected machines (Azure VMs and AWS/GCP machines) to check whether they have an EDR solution installed and running. The solution can be integrated Defender for Endpoint EDR, or asupported non-Microsoft solution.
Based on EDR solution findings, Defender for Cloud providesrecommendationsto ensure that EDR solutions are installed and running correctly on machines. This article describes how to remediate those recommendations.
Note
Defender for Cloud uses agentless scanning to assess EDR settings.
Agentless scanning replaces the Log Analytics agent (also known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)), which was previously used to collect machine data.
Scanning using the MMA will be deprecated in November 2024.
To exempt resources from these EDR assessments, ensure that theAzure CSPM initiative is assigned. This initiative is enabled by default when Defender CSPM is turned on.
