This tutorial helps you configure dedicated deployment of Azure Bastion to your virtual network from the Azure portal using the settings and SKU of your choice. The SKU determines the features and connections that are available for your deployment. For more information about SKUs and features, seeConfiguration settings - SKUs. After Bastion is deployed, you can use SSH or RDP to connect to virtual machines (VMs) in the virtual network via Bastion using the private IP addresses of the VMs. When you connect to a VM, it doesn't need a public IP address, client software, an agent, or a special configuration.
The following diagram shows the Azure Bastion dedicated deploymentarchitecturefor this tutorial. Unlike theBastion Developer architecture, a dedicated deployment architecture deploys a dedicated bastion host directly to your virtual network.

The steps in this tutorial deploy Bastion using the Standard SKU via the Dedicated Deployment OptionConfigure Manually. In this tutorial, you adjust host scaling (instance count), which the Standard SKU supports. If you use a lower SKU for the deployment, you can't adjust host scaling. You can also select an availability zone, depending on the region to which you want to deploy.
After the deployment is complete, you connect to your VM via private IP address. If your VM has a public IP address that you don't need for anything else, you can remove it.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Deploy Bastion to your virtual network.
Connect to a virtual machine.
Remove the public IP address from a virtual machine.

Note
The use of Azure Bastion with Azure Private DNS zones is supported. However, there are restrictions. For more information, see theAzure Bastion FAQ.
Deploy Bastion
This section helps you deploy Bastion to your virtual network. After Bastion is deployed, you can connect securely to any VM in the virtual network using its private IP address.
Important
Hourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Connect to a VM
You can use any of the following detailed articles to connect to a VM. Some connection types require the BastionStandard SKU.
Connect to a Windows VMRDPSSH
RDP
SSH
Connect to a Linux VMSSH
SSH
Connect to a scale set
Connect via IP address
Connect from a native clientWindows clientLinux/SSH client

You can also use these basic connection steps to connect to your VM:
In theAzure portal, go to the virtual machine that you want to connect to.

The options available on theBastionpane depend on the Bastion SKU.If you're using theBasic SKU, you connect to a Windows computer by using RDP and port 3389. Also for the Basic SKU, you connect to a Linux computer by using SSH and port 22. You don't have options to change the port number or the protocol. However, you can change the keyboard language for RDP by expandingConnection Settingson this pane.If you're using theStandard SKU, you have more connection protocol and port options available. ExpandConnection Settingsto see the options. Typically, unless you configure different settings for your VM, you connect to a Windows computer by using RDP and port 3389. You connect to a Linux computer by using SSH and port 22.

Using keyboard shortcut keys while you're connected to a VM might not result in the same behavior as shortcut keys on a local computer. For example, when you're connected to a Windows VM from a Windows client, Ctrl+Alt+End is the keyboard shortcut for Ctrl+Alt+Delete on a local computer. To do this from a Mac while you're connected to a Windows VM, the keyboard shortcut is fn+control+option+delete.
Enable audio output
You can enable remote audio output for your VM. Some VMs automatically enable this setting, whereas others require you to enable audio settings manually. The settings are changed on the VM itself. Your Bastion deployment doesn't need any special configuration settings to enable remote audio output. Audio input is not supported at the moment.
Note
Audio output uses bandwidth on your internet connection.
To enable remote audio output on a Windows VM:
After you're connected to the VM, an audio button appears on the lower-right corner of the toolbar. Right-click the audio button, and then selectSounds.
A pop-up message asks if you want to enable the Windows Audio Service. SelectYes. You can configure more audio options inSound preferences.
To verify sound output, hover over the audio button on the toolbar.
Remove a VM's public IP address
When you connect to a VM by using Azure Bastion, you don't need a public IP address for your VM. If you aren't using the public IP address for anything else, you can dissociate it from your VM:
Go to your virtual machine. On theOverviewpage, click thePublic IP addressto open the Public IP address page.

On thePublic IP addresspage, go toOverview. You can view the resource that this IP address isAssociated to. SelectDissociateat the top of the pane.
On thePublic IP addresspage, go toOverview. You can view the resource that this IP address isAssociated to. SelectDissociateat the top of the pane.
SelectYesto dissociate the IP address from the VM network interface. After you dissociate the public IP address from the network interface, verify that it's no longer listed underAssociated to.
SelectYesto dissociate the IP address from the VM network interface. After you dissociate the public IP address from the network interface, verify that it's no longer listed underAssociated to.
After you dissociate the IP address, you can delete the public IP address resource. On thePublic IP addresspane for the VM, at the top of theOverviewpage, selectDelete.

Clean up resources
When you finish using this application, delete your resources:
Enter the name of your resource group in theSearchbox at the top of the portal. When your resource group appears in the search results, select it.
SelectDelete resource group.
Enter the name of your resource group forTYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME, and then selectDelete.
Next steps
In this tutorial, you deployed Bastion to a virtual network and connected to a VM. You then removed the public IP address from the VM. Next, learn about and configure additional Bastion features.
