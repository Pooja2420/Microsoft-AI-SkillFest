Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
This article provides guidance for using the3.x agent softwarewith Azure DevOps Services and current versions of Azure DevOps Server. For a list of Azure DevOps Server versions that support the 3.x agent, seeDoes Azure DevOps Server support the 3.x agent.
To run your jobs, you need at least one agent. A Linux agent can build and deploy different kinds of apps, including Java and Android apps. SeeCheck prerequisitesfor a list of supported Linux distributions.
Note
This article describes how to configure aself-hosted agent. If you're using Azure DevOps Services and aMicrosoft-hosted agentmeets your needs, you can skip setting up a self-hosted Linux agent.
Learn about agents
If you already know what an agent is and how it works, feel free to jump right in to the following sections. But if you'd like some more background about what they do and how they work, seeAzure Pipelines agents.
Check prerequisites
The agent is based on .NET 6.
You can run this agent on several Linux distributions.
We support the following subset of .NET 6 supported distributions:

Git- Regardless of your platform, you need to install Git 2.9.0 or higher.
We strongly recommend installing the latest version of Git.
.NET- The agent software runs on .NET 6, but installs its own version of .NET so there is no .NET prerequisite.
Subversion- If you're building from a Subversion repo, you must install the Subversion client on the machine.
TFVC- If you're building from a TFVC repo, seeTFVC prerequisites.
Note
The agent installer knows how to check for other dependencies.
You can install those dependencies on supported Linux platforms by running./bin/installdependencies.shin the agent directory.
./bin/installdependencies.sh
Be aware that some of these dependencies required by .NET are fetched from third party sites, likepackages.efficios.com. Review theinstalldependencies.shscript and ensure any referenced third party sites are accessible from your Linux machine before running the script.
packages.efficios.com
installdependencies.sh
Please also make sure that all required repositories are connected to the relevant package manager used ininstalldependencies.sh(likeaptorzypper).
installdependencies.sh
apt
zypper
For issues with dependencies installation (like 'dependency was not found in repository' or 'problem retrieving the repository index file') - you can reach out to distribution owner for further support.
You should run agent setup manually the first time.
After you get a feel for how agents work, or if you want to automate setting up many agents, consider usingunattended config.
Prepare permissions
Information security for self-hosted agents
The user configuring the agent needs pool admin permissions, but the user running the agent does not.
The folders controlled by the agent should be restricted to as few users as possible because they contain secrets that could be decrypted or exfiltrated.
The Azure Pipelines agent is a software product designed to execute code it downloads from external sources. It inherently could be a target for Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.
Therefore, it is important to consider the threat model surrounding each individual usage of Pipelines Agents to perform work, and decide what are the minimum permissions that could be granted to the user running the agent, to the machine where the agent runs, to the users who have write access to the Pipeline definition, the git repos where the yaml is stored, or the group of users who control access to the pool for new pipelines.
It is a best practice to have the identity running the agent be different from the identity with permissions to connect the agent to the pool. The user generating the credentials (and other agent-related files) is different than the user that needs to read them. Therefore, it is safer to carefully consider access granted to the agent machine itself, and the agent folders which contain sensitive files, such as logs and artifacts.
It makes sense to grant access to the agent folder only for DevOps administrators and the user identity running the agent process. Administrators may need to investigate the file system to understand build failures or get log files to be able to report Azure DevOps failures.
Decide which user you'll use
As a one-time step, you must register the agent. Someone with permission toadminister the agent queuemust complete these steps. The agent will not use this person's
credentials in everyday operation, but they're required to complete registration.
Learn more abouthow agents communicate.
Confirm the user has permission
Make sure the user account that you're going to use has permission to register the agent.
Is the user an Azure DevOps organization owner or TFS or Azure DevOps Server administrator?Stop here, you have permission.

Run interactively
For guidance on whether to run the agent in interactive mode or as a service, seeAgents: Interactive vs. service.
To run the agent interactively:
If you have been running the agent as a service,uninstall the service.
If you have been running the agent as a service,uninstall the service.
Run the agent../run.sh
Run the agent.
./run.sh
./run.sh
To restart the agent, press Ctrl+C and then runrun.shto restart it.
run.sh
To use your agent, run ajobusing the agent's pool.
If you didn't choose a different pool, your agent is placed in theDefaultpool.
Run once
For agents configured to run interactively, you can choose to have the agent accept only one job.
To run in this configuration:
./run.sh --once
./run.sh --once
Agents in this mode accept only one job and then spin down gracefully (useful for running inDockeron a service like Azure Container Instances).
Run as a systemd service
If your agent is running on these operating systems you can run the agent as asystemdservice:
systemd
Ubuntu 16 LTS or newer
Red Hat 7.1 or newer
We provide an example./svc.shscript for you to run and manage your agent as asystemdservice.
This script will be generated after you configure the agent.
We encourage you to review, and if needed, update the script before running it.
./svc.sh
systemd
Some important caveats:
If you run your agent as a service, you cannot run the agent service asrootuser.
root
Users runningSELinuxhave reported difficulties with the providedsvc.shscript.
Refer tothis agent issueas a starting point.
SELinux is not an officially supported configuration.
svc.sh
Note
If you have a different distribution, or if you prefer other approaches, you can use whatever kind of service mechanism you prefer. SeeService files.
Commands
For example, if you installed in themyagentsubfolder of your home directory:
myagent
cd ~/myagent$
cd ~/myagent$
Command:
sudo ./svc.sh install [username]
sudo ./svc.sh install [username]
This command creates a service file that points to./runsvc.sh. This script sets up the environment (more details below) and starts the agents host. Ifusernameparameter is not specified, the username is taken from the $SUDO_USER environment variable set by sudo command. This variable is always equal to the name of the user who invoked thesudocommand.
./runsvc.sh
username
sudo
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
sudo ./svc.sh status
sudo ./svc.sh stop
sudo ./svc.sh stop
You should stop before you uninstall.
sudo ./svc.sh uninstall
sudo ./svc.sh uninstall
Update environment variables
When you configure the service, it takes a snapshot of some useful environment variables for your current logon user such as PATH, LANG, JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and MYSQL_PATH. If you need to update the variables (for example, after installing some new software):
./env.sh
sudo ./svc.sh stop
sudo ./svc.sh start
./env.sh
sudo ./svc.sh stop
sudo ./svc.sh start
The snapshot of the environment variables is stored in.envfile (PATHis stored in.path) under agent root directory, you can also change these files directly to apply environment variable changes.
.env
PATH
.path
Run instructions before the service starts
You can also run your own instructions and commands to run when the service starts.  For example, you could set up the environment or call scripts.
Editrunsvc.sh.
Editrunsvc.sh.
runsvc.sh
Replace the following line with your instructions:# insert anything to setup env when running as a service
Replace the following line with your instructions:
# insert anything to setup env when running as a service
# insert anything to setup env when running as a service
Service files
When you install the service, some service files are put in place.
Asystemdservice file is created:
systemd
/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.{tfs-name}.{agent-name}.service
/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.{tfs-name}.{agent-name}.service
For example, you have configured an agent (see above) with the nameour-linux-agent. The service file will be either:
our-linux-agent
Azure Pipelines: the name of your organization. For example if you connect tohttps://dev.azure.com/fabrikam, then the service name would be/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.fabrikam.our-linux-agent.service
Azure Pipelines: the name of your organization. For example if you connect tohttps://dev.azure.com/fabrikam, then the service name would be/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.fabrikam.our-linux-agent.service
https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam
/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.fabrikam.our-linux-agent.service
TFS or Azure DevOps Server: the name of your on-premises server. For example if you connect tohttp://our-server:8080/tfs, then the service name would be/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.our-server.our-linux-agent.service
TFS or Azure DevOps Server: the name of your on-premises server. For example if you connect tohttp://our-server:8080/tfs, then the service name would be/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.our-server.our-linux-agent.service
http://our-server:8080/tfs
/etc/systemd/system/vsts.agent.our-server.our-linux-agent.service
sudo ./svc.sh installgenerates this file from this template:./bin/vsts.agent.service.template
sudo ./svc.sh install
./bin/vsts.agent.service.template
sudo ./svc.sh startfinds the service by reading the.servicefile, which contains the name of systemd service file described above.
sudo ./svc.sh start
.service
Alternative service mechanisms
We provide the./svc.shscript as a convenient way for you to run and manage your agent as a systemd service. But you can use whatever kind of service mechanism you prefer (for example: initd or upstart).
./svc.sh
You can use the template described above as to facilitate generating other kinds of service files.
Use a cgroup to avoid agent failure
It's important to avoid situations in which the agent fails or become unusable because otherwise the agent can't stream pipeline logs or report pipeline status back to the server. You can mitigate the risk of this kind of problem being caused by high memory pressure by usingcgroupsand a loweroom_score_adj. After you've done this, Linux reclaims system memory from pipeline job processes before reclaiming memory from the agent process.Learn how to configurecgroupsand OOM score.

Diagnostics
If you're having trouble with your self-hosted agent, you can try running diagnostics.
After configuring the agent:
./run.sh --diagnostics
./run.sh --diagnostics
This will run through a diagnostic suite that may help you troubleshoot the problem.
The diagnostics feature is available starting with agent version 2.165.0.
Network diagnostics for self-hosted agents
Set the value ofAgent.Diagnostictotrueto collect additional logs that can be used for troubleshooting network issues for self-hosted agents. For more information, seeNetwork diagnostics for self-hosted agents.
Agent.Diagnostic
true
Help on other options
To learn about other options:
./config.sh --help
./config.sh --help
The help provides information on authentication alternatives and unattended configuration.
Capabilities
Your agent's capabilities are cataloged and advertised in the pool so that only the builds and releases it can handle are assigned to it. SeeBuild and release agent capabilities.
In many cases, after you deploy an agent, you'll need to install software or utilities. Generally you should install on your agents whatever software and tools you use on your development machine.
For example, if your build includes thenpm task, then the build won't run unless there's a build agent in the pool that has npm installed.
Important
Capabilities include all environment variables and the values that are set when the agent runs. If any of these values change while the agent is running, the agent must be restarted to pick up the new values. After you install new software on an agent, you must restart the agent for the new capability to show up in the pool, so that the build can run.
If you want to exclude environment variables as capabilities, you can designate them by setting an environment variableVSO_AGENT_IGNOREwith a comma-delimited list of variables to ignore.

Can I update my agents that are part of an Azure DevOps Server pool?
Yes.
Beginning with Azure DevOps Server 2019, you can configure your server to look for the agent package files on a local disk.
This configuration will override the default version that came with the server at the time of its release.
This scenario also applies when the server doesn't have access to the internet.
From a computer with Internet access, download the latest version of the agent package files (in .zip or .tar.gz form) from theAzure Pipelines Agent GitHub Releases page.

Note
This procedure enables the agent to bypass a web proxy. Your build pipeline and scripts must still handle bypassing your web proxy for each task and tool you run in your build.
For example, if you are using a NuGet task, you must configure your web proxy to support bypassing the URL for the server that hosts the NuGet feed you're using.
I'm using TFS and the URLs in the sections above don't work for me. Where can I get help?
Web site settings and security
I use TFS on-premises and I don't see some of these features. Why not?
Some of these features are available only onAzure Pipelinesand not yet available on-premises. Some features are available on-premises if you haveupgraded to the latest version of TFS.
TFVC prerequisites
If you'll be using TFVC, you'll also need theOracle Java JDK 1.6or higher.
(The Oracle JRE and OpenJDK aren't sufficient for this purpose.)
TEE pluginis used for TFVC functionality.
It has an EULA, which you need to accept during configuration if you plan to work with TFVC.
Since the TEE plugin is no longer maintained and contains some out-of-date Java dependencies, starting from Agent 2.198.0 it's no longer included in the agent distribution. However, the TEE plugin will be downloaded during checkout task execution if you're checking out a TFVC repo. The TEE plugin will be removed after the job execution.
Note
Note: You may notice your checkout task taking a long time to start working because of this download mechanism.
If the agent is running behind a proxy or a firewall, you need to ensure access to the following site:https://vstsagenttools.blob.core.windows.net/. The TEE plugin will be downloaded from this address.
https://vstsagenttools.blob.core.windows.net/
If you're using a self-hosted agent and facing issues with TEE downloading, you may install TEE manually:
SetDISABLE_TEE_PLUGIN_REMOVALenvironment or pipeline variable totrue. This variable prevents the agent from removing the TEE plugin after TFVC repository checkout.
DISABLE_TEE_PLUGIN_REMOVAL
true
Download TEE-CLC version 14.135.0 manually fromTeam Explorer Everywhere GitHub releases.
Extract the contents ofTEE-CLC-14.135.0folder to<agent_directory>/externals/tee.
