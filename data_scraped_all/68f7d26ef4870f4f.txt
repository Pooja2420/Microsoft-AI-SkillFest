This quickstart guides you through the process of creating an Azure Front Door profile using the Azure portal. You have two options to create an Azure Front Door profile: Quick create and Custom create. The Quick create option allows you to configure the basic settings of your profile, while the Custom create option enables you to customize your profile with more advanced settings.
In this quickstart, you use the Custom create option to create an Azure Front Door profile. You first deploy two App services as your origin servers. Then, you configure the Azure Front Door profile to route traffic to your App services based on certain rules. Finally, you test the connectivity to your App services by accessing the Azure Front Door frontend hostname.

Note
For web workloads, we highly recommend utilizingAzure DDoS protectionand aweb application firewallto safeguard against emerging DDoS attacks. Another option is to employAzure Front Dooralong with a web application firewall. Azure Front Door offersplatform-level protectionagainst network-level DDoS attacks.

You create an Azure Front Door profile usingCustom createand deploy two App services that your Azure Front Door profile uses as your origins.
Create two Web App instances
If you already have services to use as an origin, skip tocreate a Front Door for your application.
This example demonstrates how to create two Web App instances deployed in different Azure regions. Both web application instances operate in an active/active mode, meaning they can both handle incoming traffic. This configuration differs from an active/standby configuration, where one instance serves as a backup for the other.
To create the two Web Apps for this example, follow these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal.

To start creating the first Web App, select the+ Create a resourcebutton on the top left corner of the portal. Then, typeWeb Appin the search box and selectCreateto proceed with the configuration.

To create a second Web App, follow the same steps as for the first Web App, but make the following changes in the settings:SettingDescriptionResource groupSelectCreate newand entermyAppResourceGroup2.NameEnter a unique name for your Web App, in this example,webapp-contoso-002.RegionA different region, in this example,South Central USApp Service plan>Windows PlanSelectNewand entermyAppServicePlanSouthCentralUS, and then selectOK.
To create a second Web App, follow the same steps as for the first Web App, but make the following changes in the settings:
Create a Front Door for your application
In this step, you configure Azure Front Door to route user traffic to the nearest Web App origin based on latency. Additionally, you apply a Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy to protect your Azure Front Door from malicious attacks.

On theAdd a routepage, enter or select the following information and then selectAddto add the route to the endpoint configuration.SettingDescriptionNameProvide a name that identifies the mapping between domains and origin group.DomainsThe system generates a domain name for you to use. To add a custom domain, selectAdd a new domain. This example uses the default domain name.Patterns to matchSpecify the URLs that this route accepts. This example uses the default setting, which accepts all URL paths.Accepted protocolsChoose the protocol that the route accepts. This example accepts both HTTP and HTTPS requests.RedirectTurn on this setting to redirect all HTTP requests to the HTTPS endpoint.Origin groupTo create a new origin group, selectAdd a new origin groupand entermyOriginGroupas the origin group name. Then select+ Add an originand enterWebApp1for theNameandApp servicesfor theOrigin Type. In theHost name, selectwebapp-contoso-001.azurewebsites.netand selectAddto add the origin to the origin group. Repeat the steps to add the second Web App as an origin withWebApp2as theNameandwebapp-contoso-002.azurewebsites.netas theHost name. Choose apriorityfor each origin, with the lowest number having the highest priority. If you need Azure Front Door to serve both origins, use a priority of 1. Choose a weight for each origin, with the weight determining how traffic is routed to the origins. Use equal weights of 1000 if the traffic needs to be routed to both origins equally. Once both Web App origins are added, selectAddto save the origin group configuration.Origin pathLeave this field empty.Forwarding protocolChoose the protocol that the origin group receives.

Verify Azure Front Door
The global deployment of the Azure Front Door profile takes a few minutes to complete. After that, you can access the frontend host by entering its endpoint hostname in a browser. For example,contoso-frontend.z01.azurefd.net. The request is automatically routed to the closest server among the specified servers in the origin group.
contoso-frontend.z01.azurefd.net
To test the instant global failover feature, follow these steps if you created the apps in this quickstart. You see an information page with the app details.
Enter the endpoint hostname in a browser, for example,contoso-frontend.z01.azurefd.net.

Clean up resources
If you no longer need the environment, you can delete all the resources you created. Deleting a resource group also removes all its contents. To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, we recommend deleting these resources if you don't plan to use this Azure Front Door.
In the Azure portal, search for and selectResource groups, or navigate toResource groupsfrom the Azure portal menu.
