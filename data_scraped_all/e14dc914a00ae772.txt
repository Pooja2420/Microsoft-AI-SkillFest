As a cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS), Azure API Management abstracts many details of the infrastructure used to host and run your service.The infrastructure associated with the API Managementstv1compute platform version will be retired effective 31 August 2024 in the global Microsoft Azure cloud.A more current compute platform version (stv2) is already available, and provides enhanced service capabilities.

Note
For API Management instances deployed in Microsoft Azure Government cloud or Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet cloud (Azure in China), the retirement date for thestv1platform is 24 February 2025.Learn more

The following table summarizes the compute platforms currently used for instances in the different API Management service tiers.

For continued support and to take advantage of upcoming features, customers mustmigratetheir Azure API Management instances from thestv1compute platform to thestv2compute platform.Thestv2compute platform comes with additional features and improvements such as support for Azure Private Link and other networking features.

New instances created in service tiers other than the Consumption tier are mostly hosted on thestv2platform already. Existing instances on thestv1compute platform will continue to work normally until the retirement date, but those instances won't receive the latest features available to thestv2platform. Support forstv1instances will be retired by 31 August 2024.

Is my service affected by this?
If the value of theplatformVersionproperty of your service isstv1, it's hosted on thestv1platform. SeeHow do I know which platform hosts my API Management instance?

What is the deadline for the change?
Support for API Management instances hosted on thestv1platform will be retired by 31 August 2024.

What do I need to do?
Migrate all your existing instances hosted on thestv1compute platform to thestv2compute platform.

If you have existing instances hosted on thestv1platform, follow ourmigration guideto ensure a successful migration.

What happens after 31 August 2024?
Yourstv1instance will not be shut down, deactivated, or deleted.However, the SLA commitment for the instance ends, and anystv1instance after the retirement date will be scheduled for automatic migration to thestv2platform.

End of SLA commitment forstv1instances
stv1
As of 1 September 2024, API Management will no longer provide any service level guarantees, and by extension service credits, for performance or availability issues related to the Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium service instances running on thestv1compute platform. Also, no new security and compliance investments will be made in the API Managementstv1platform.

Through continued use of an instance hosted on thestv1platform beyond the retirement date, you acknowledge that Azure does not commit to the SLA of 99.95% for the retired instances.
stv1
Automatic migration
After the retirement date, we'll automatically migrate remainingstv1service instances to thestv2compute platform. All affected customers will be notified of the upcoming automatic migration a week in advance. Automatic migration might cause downtime for your upstream API consumers. You can still migrate your own instances before automatic migration takes place.

Virtual network configuration might be removed during automatic migration
Im most cases, automatic migration retains the virtual network settings of your API Management instance, if they're configured. Under certainspecial conditions, the virtual network configuration of yourstv1service instance is removed during automatic migration and, as a security measure, access to your service endpoints is blocked. If the network settings were removed during the migration process, you'll see a message in the portal similar to:We have blocked access to all endpoints for your service.
stv1
We have blocked access to all endpoints for your service

While access is blocked, access to the API gateway, developer portal, direct management API, and Git repository is disabled.
Restore access and virtual network configuration
If access is blocked, you can restore access to your service endpoints and your virtual network configuration using the portal or the Azure CLI.
Tip
If you need a reminder of the names of the virtual network and subnet where your API Management instance was originally deployed, you can find information in the portal. In the left menu of your instance, selectDiagnose and solve problems>Availability and performance>VNet Verifier. InTime range, select a period before the instance was migrated.
Portal
Azure CLI
In the portal, on theOverviewpage of the instance, selectUnblock my service. This action isn't reversible.WarningAfter you unblock access to your service endpoints, they're publicly accessible from the internet. To protect your environment, make sure to reestablish your virtual network as soon as possible after unblocking access.

Run the following Azure CLI commands to enable access to the API Management instance and restore configuration of the specified virtual network.
