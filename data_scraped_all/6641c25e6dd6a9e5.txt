Features
Ubuntu 24.04 on Azure Pipelines hosted agents
Use Workload identity federation in Azure integration tests
New Azure service connection creation experience with improved Managed identity support

Ubuntu 24.04 on Azure Pipelines hosted agents
The Ubuntu 24.04 image is now available for Azure Pipelines hosted agents. To use this image, update your YAML file to includevmImage:'ubuntu-24.04':
vmImage:'ubuntu-24.04'
- job: ubuntu2404
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-24.04'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from Ubuntu 24.04
      lsb_release -d
- job: ubuntu2404
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-24.04'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from Ubuntu 24.04
      lsb_release -d
Note
Theubuntu-latestimage label will continue to point to ubuntu-22.04 until later this year.

Use Workload identity federation in Azure integration tests
In June, the Azure Identity libraries for.NET, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Pythonadded support for workload identity federation. This added the ability for code executed from theAzureCLI@2andAzurePowerShell@5tasks to authenticate with Microsoft Entra (for example, to access Azure) with theAzurePipelinesCredentialclass.
AzurePipelinesCredential
Many customers are using the Azure Identity libraries in integration tests invoked from other tasks. We've now added support forAzurePipelinesCredentialto theDotNetCoreCLI@2,Maven@4andVSTest@3tasks.
AzurePipelinesCredential
You can set theconnectedServiceproperty to an Azure service connection configured with workload identity federation. TheAzurePipelinesCredentialrequiresSYSTEM_ACCESSTOKENto be set.

New Azure service connection creation experience with improved Managed identity support
The new Azure service connection creation experience provides increased flexibility and secure defaults. It also aligns terminology with Microsoft Entra ID, so that users who create Microsoft Entra ID objects manually have a better understanding when navigating different portals.
When creating a new Azure Resource Manager service connection, the various options to configure identity are now available in a single unified dialog that replaces the distinct top level items used previously:

Identity typelists all authentication schemes the Azure service connection supports:

For app registrations, you can independently selectCredentialto beworkload identity federationor a secret.
You can now select a pre-existing managed identity and use it to configure a service connection that uses workload identity federation. First,create a User-assigned Managed Identity.
Then, create an Azure service connection and select theManaged identityIdentity Type. This configures federated identity credentials on the managed identity.

The option to use a managed identity assigned to an agent (pool) has been renamedManaged identity (agent-assigned). To prevent sharing over-privileged managed identities, it's recommended to use a managed identity with workload identity federation instead of managed identities assigned to agent pools.
Managed identity is also the recommended option for users who can't create an App registration if that isdisabled in Microsoft Entra ID.
To use a managed identity with workload identity federation, first select the subscription and resource group that holds your managed identity. This can be different from the subscription the service connection accesses in pipeline jobs. Pick the managed identity that is configured for workload identity federation. The user needs theManaged Identity Contributorrole or equivalent permissions on the managed identity to create federated identity credentials on it.
Continue to select the subscription that will be used as the deployment scope for the service connection.

Some organizations require theService Management Referenceof an App registration to be populated with relevant context information from an ITSM database. If necessary to do so, users can specify this reference at service connection creation time.
The new Azure service connection creation experience is rolling out over the next month. For more information, see:

Troubleshooting
Run children stages when parent stage fails
We made it easier to continue deployments using Azure Pipelines. This is useful, for example, when you use Pipelines to deploy new versions of your application across multiple Azure regions.
Say you need to deploy to five consecutive Azure regions. Assume your pipeline has a stage for each region, and each stage has a job that runs anAzureResourceManagerTemplateDeploymenttask, and then it logs some telemetry. The latter is nice to have, but not critical. Imagine there's an issue logging the telemetry. Now, the stage fails and the deployment stops.
AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment
Starting with this sprint, when a stage fails, you can resume running its children stages.

These features will roll out over the next two to three weeks.
