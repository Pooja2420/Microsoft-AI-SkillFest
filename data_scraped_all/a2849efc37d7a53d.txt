Microsoft Entra identity management and access management for AWS
This article provides AWS identity architects, administrators, and security analysts with immediate insights and detailed guidance for deploying Microsoft Entra identity and access solutions for AWS. You can configure and test these Microsoft security solutions without affecting your existing identity providers and AWS account users until you're ready to switch over.
Architecture
AWS creates a separateIdentity and Access Management (IAM) storefor each account it creates. The following diagram shows the standard setup for an AWS environment with a single AWS account:

Theroot userfully controls the AWS account, and delegates access to other identities. The AWS IAMprincipalprovides a unique identity for each role and user that needs to access the AWS account. AWS IAM can protect each root, principal, and user account with a complex password and basic MFA.
Many organizations need more than one AWS account, resulting inidentity silosthat are complex to manage:

To allow centralized identity management and avoid having to manage multiple identities and passwords, most organizations want to use single sign-on for platform resources. Some AWS customers rely on server-based Microsoft Active Directory for SSO integration. Other customers invest in third-party solutions to synchronize or federate their identities and provide SSO.
Microsoft Entra ID provides centralized identity management with strong SSO authentication. Almost any app or platform that follows common web authentication standards, including AWS, can use Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access management.
Many organizations already use Microsoft Entra ID to assign and protect Microsoft 365 or hybrid cloud identities. Employees use their Microsoft Entra identities to access email, files, instant messaging, cloud applications, and on-premises resources. You can quickly and easily integrate Microsoft Entra ID with your AWS accounts to let administrators and developers sign in to your AWS environments with their existing identities.
The following diagram shows how Microsoft Entra ID can integrate with multiple AWS accounts to provide centralized identity and access management:

Microsoft Entra ID offers several capabilities for direct integration with AWS:
SSO across legacy, traditional, and modern authentication solutions.
MFA, including integration with several third-party solutions fromMicrosoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA)partners.
PowerfulConditional Accessfeatures for strong authentication and strict governance. Microsoft Entra ID uses Conditional Access policies and risk-based assessments to authenticate and authorize user access to the AWS Management Console and AWS resources.
Large-scale threat detection and automated response. Microsoft Entra ID processes over 30 billion authentication requests per day, along with trillions of signals about threats worldwide.
Privileged Access Management (PAM)to enableJust-In-Time (JIT) provisioningto specific resources.

Advanced Microsoft Entra identity management with AWS accounts
Other advanced Microsoft Entra features can provide extra layers of control for the most sensitive AWS accounts. Microsoft Entra ID P2 licenses include these advanced features:
Privileged Identity Management (PIM)to provide advanced controls for all delegated roles within Azure and Microsoft 365. For example, instead of a user administrator being statically assigned the User Administrator role, they have permission to activate the role on demand. This permission deactivates after a set time limit (one hour, for example). PIM logs all activations and has other controls that can further restrict the activation capabilities. PIM further protects your identity architecture by ensuring extra layers of governance and protection before privileged users can make changes.You can expandPIM to any delegated permission by controlling access to custom groups, such as the ones you created for access to AWS roles. For more information about deploying PIM, seePlan a Privileged Identity Management deployment.

Advanced Identity Protectionincreases Microsoft Entra sign-in security by monitoring user or session risk. User risk defines the potential of the credentials being compromised, such as the user ID and password appearing in a publicly released breach list. Session risk determines whether the sign-in activity comes from a risky location, IP address, or other indicator of compromise. Both detection types draw on Microsoft's comprehensive threat intelligence capabilities.For more information about Advanced Identity Protection, see theMicrosoft Entra ID Protection security overview.

Scenario details
Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts that support critical workloads and highly sensitive information need strong identity protection and access control. AWS identity management is enhanced when combined with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based, comprehensive, centralized identity and access management solution that can help secure and protect AWS accounts and environments. Microsoft Entra ID provides centralizedsingle sign-on (SSO)and strong authentication throughmultifactor authentication (MFA)andConditional Accesspolicies. Microsoft Entra ID supports AWS identity management, role-based identities, and access control.
Many organizations that use AWS already rely on Microsoft Entra ID for Microsoft 365 or hybrid cloud identity management and access protection. These organizations can quickly and easily use Microsoft Entra ID with their AWS accounts, often without extra cost. Other,advanced Microsoft Entra featureslike Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Advanced Identity Protection can help protect the most sensitive AWS accounts.
Microsoft Entra ID easily integrates with other Microsoft security solutions, like Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, seeDefender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Sentinel for AWS. Microsoft security solutions are extensible and have multiple levels of protection. Organizations can implement one or more of these solutions along with other types of protection for a full security architecture that protects current and future AWS deployments.
Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
The following principles and guidelines are important for any cloud security solution:
Ensure that the organization can monitor, detect, and automatically protect user and programmatic access into cloud environments.

Specific workload platforms, like Windows Server, Linux Server, or containers.
Devices that administrators and developers use to access the AWS Management Console.
A key aspect of securing the AWS Management Console is controlling who can make sensitive configuration changes. The AWS account root user has unrestricted access. The security team should fully control the root user account to prevent it from signing in to the AWS Management Console or working with AWS resources.
To control the root user account:
Consider changing the root user sign-in credentials from an individual's email address to a service account that the security team controls.
Make sure the root user account password is complex, and enforce MFA for the root user.
Monitor logs for instances of the root user account being used to sign in.
Use the root user account only in emergencies.
Use Microsoft Entra ID to implement delegated administrative access rather than using the root user for administrative tasks.
Clearly understand and review other AWS IAM account components for appropriate mapping and assignments.
By default, an AWS account has noIAM usersuntil the root user creates one or more identities to delegate access. A solution that synchronizes existing users from another identity system, such as Microsoft Active Directory, can also automatically provision IAM users.

Deploy this scenario
This next section shows you how to deploy Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on to an individual AWS account.
Plan and prepare
To prepare for deployment of Azure security solutions, review and record current AWS account and Microsoft Entra information. If you've more than one AWS account deployed, repeat these steps for each account.
In theAWS Billing Management Console, record the following current AWS account information:AWS Account Id, a unique identifier.Account Nameor root user.Payment method, whether assigned to a credit card or a company billing agreement.Alternate contactswho have access to AWS account information.Security questionssecurely updated and recorded for emergency access.AWS regionsenabled or disabled to comply with data security policy.

The Microsoft Entra deployment procedures assume that Microsoft Entra ID is already configured for the organization, such as for a Microsoft 365 implementation. Accounts can be synchronized from an Active Directory domain, or can be cloud accounts created directly in Microsoft Entra ID.
If the AWS installation uses IAM groups and roles for RBAC, you can map the existing RBAC structure to new Microsoft Entra user accounts and security groups.
If the AWS account doesn't have a strong RBAC implementation, start by working on the most sensitive access:
Update the AWS account root user.
Update the AWS account root user.
Review the AWS IAM users, groups, and roles that are attached to the IAM policyAdministratorAccess.
Review the AWS IAM users, groups, and roles that are attached to the IAM policyAdministratorAccess.
Work through the other assigned IAM policies, starting with policies that can modify, create, or delete resources and other configuration items. You can identify policies in use by looking at theUsed ascolumn.

Microsoft Entra ID centralizes all authentication and authorization. You can plan and configure user mapping and RBAC without affecting administrators and developers until you're ready to enforce the new methods.
The high-level process for migrating from AWS IAM accounts to Microsoft Entra ID is as follows. For detailed instructions, seeDeployment.
Map IAM policies to Microsoft Entra roles, and use RBAC to map roles to security groups.

Once the user confirms Microsoft Entra ID access, remove the AWS IAM user account. Repeat the process for each user until they're all migrated.
Once the user confirms Microsoft Entra ID access, remove the AWS IAM user account. Repeat the process for each user until they're all migrated.
For service accounts and programmatic access, use the same approach. Update each application that uses the account to use an equivalent Microsoft Entra user account instead.
Make sure any remaining AWS IAM users have complex passwords with MFA enabled, or an access key that's replaced regularly.
The following diagram shows an example of the configuration steps and final policy and role mapping across Microsoft Entra ID and AWS IAM:

Single sign-on integration
Microsoft Entra ID supports single sign-on integration with AWS SSO. You can connect Microsoft Entra ID to AWS in one place and centrally govern access across hundreds of accounts and AWS SSO integrated applications. This capability enables seamless Microsoft Entra sign-in experience for users to use the AWS CLI.
The following Microsoft security solution procedure implements SSO for the example rolesAWS AdministratorsandAWS Developers. Repeat this process for any other roles you need.
This procedure covers the following steps:
Create a new Microsoft Entra enterprise application.
Configure Microsoft Entra SSO for AWS.
Update role mapping.
Test Microsoft Entra SSO into AWS Management Console.
The following links provide full detailed implementation steps and troubleshooting:

AWS tutorial: Microsoft Entra ID to AWS SSO using the SCIM protocol

Add an AWS app to your Microsoft Entra enterprise applications
AWS administrators and developers use an enterprise application to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, then redirect to AWS for authorization and access to AWS resources. The simplest method to see the application is by signing in tohttps://myapps.microsoft.com, but you can also publish the unique URL anywhere that provides easy access.
https://myapps.microsoft.com
Follow the instructions inadd Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the galleryto set up the enterprise application. These instructions will let you know what AWS app to add to your Microsoft Entra enterprise applications.
If there's more than one AWS account to administer, such as DevTest and Production, use a unique name for the enterprise application that includes an identifier for the company and specific AWS account.

You might need to create several Conditional Access policies to meet business needs for strong authentication. Consider the naming convention you use when creating the policies to ensure ease of identification and ongoing maintenance. Also, unless MFA is already widely deployed, make sure the policy is scoped to affect only the intended users. Other policies should cover other user groups' needs.
Once you enable Conditional Access, you can impose other controls such as PAM and just-in-time (JIT) provisioning. For more information, seeWhat is automated SaaS app user provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID.
If you have Defender for Cloud Apps, you can use Conditional Access to configure Defender for Cloud Apps session policies. For more information, seeConfigure Microsoft Entra session policies for AWS activities.
