To get the most out of your Azure VMware Solution private cloud experience, scale the clusters and hosts to reflect what you need for planned workloads. You can scale the clusters and hosts in a private cloud as required for your application workload.  You should address performance and availability limitations for specific services on a case-by-case basis.
The following table describes the maximum limits for Azure VMware Solution.
* For information about an RPO lower than 15 minutes, seeHow the 5-minute RPO worksin the vSphere Replication Administration documentation.
** This soft recommended limit can support higher throughput based on the scenario.
For other VMware-specific limits, use theVMware by Broadcom configuration maximum tool.
In this tutorial, learn how to use the Azure portal to:
Add a cluster to an existing private cloud
Add hosts to an existing cluster
Prerequisites
You need an existing private cloud to complete this tutorial. If you don't already have a private cloud created, follow thecreate a private cloud tutorialto create one.
If you are planning on using the AV64 SKU, define a network for the management and control plane. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, underManage, selectClusters>Add a cluster. Then add theAddress block for AV64 clusters(one /23 network or three /25 networks) under theExtended address blocktab and selectSave.

Add a new cluster
In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, underManage, selectClusters>Add a cluster. Then select the required SKU fromSize of hostand specify theNumber of hostsfor the cluster.Prices listed in image are for illustration only.
We do not allow the mixing of AV36, AV36P, or AV52 SKUs within the same cluster. We only allow the addition of AV64 clusters to existing private clouds that are built with the AV36, AV36P, or AV52 SKUs in certain regions.For more information.

The deployment of the new cluster will begin.
Scale a cluster
Note
Scaling down a cluster successfully requires all objects (VM/vmdk/iso/etc) on a vSAN datastore to be configured with a storage policy below or equal toRAID level requirements.
Scaling down a cluster will place requested host(s) into maintenance mode prior to actual removal of host from vCenter inventory.
Caution
Deleting a cluster terminates all running workloads and components and is an irreversible operation. Once you delete a cluster, you cannot recover the data.
In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, underManage, selectClusters.
In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, underManage, selectClusters.
Select the cluster you want to scale, selectMore(...), then selectEdit.
Select the cluster you want to scale, selectMore(...), then selectEdit.

SelectAdd Hostto add a host to the cluster. Repeat that to reach the desired number of hosts, and then selectSave.The addition of hosts to the cluster begins.NoteThe hosts will be added to the cluster in parallel.

The addition of hosts to the cluster begins.
Note
The hosts will be added to the cluster in parallel.
Next steps
If you require another Azure VMware Solution private cloud,create another private cloudfollowing the same networking prerequisites, cluster, and host limits.
