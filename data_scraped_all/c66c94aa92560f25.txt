Managed Identity support eliminates the need for shared keys as a method of authentication by utilizing a system-assigned managed identity provided by Microsoft Entra ID.
When you enable this configuration, the system-assigned managed identities will be used for the following scenarios:
Storage Sync Service authentication to Azure file share
Registered server authentication to Azure file share
Registered server authentication to Storage Sync Service
To learn more about the benefits of using managed identities, seeManaged identities for Azure resources.
To configure your Azure File Sync deployment to utilize system-assigned managed identities follow the guidance in the subsequent sections.
Prerequisites
Portal
PowerShell
Azure File Sync agent version 20.0.0.0 or latermust be installed on the registered server.

Regional availability
Azure File Sync support for system-assigned managed identities  is available inall Azure Public and Gov regionsthat support Azure File Sync.
Enable a system-assigned managed identity on your registered servers
Before you can configure Azure File Sync to use managed identities, your registered servers must have a system-assigned managed identity that will be used to authenticate to the Azure File Sync service and Azure file shares.
To enable a system-assigned managed identity on a registered server that has the Azure File Sync v20 agent installed, perform the following steps:
If the server is hosted outside of Azure, it must be anAzure Arc-enabled serverto have a system-assigned managed identity. For more information on Azure Arc-enabled servers and how to install the Azure Connected Machine agent, see:Azure Arc-enabled servers Overview.
If the server is an Azure virtual machine,enable the system-assigned managed identity setting on the VM. For more information, see:Configure managed identities on Azure virtual machines.
Note
Once the Storage Sync Service is configured to use managed identities, registered servers that do not have a system-assigned managed identity will continue to use a shared key to authenticate to your Azure file shares.
How to check if your registered servers have a system-assigned managed identity
Portal
PowerShell
To check if your registered servers have a system-assigned managed identity, perform the following steps using the portal:
Go to yourStorage Sync Servicein the Azure portal, expandSettingsand selectManaged identity.
Go to yourStorage Sync Servicein the Azure portal, expandSettingsand selectManaged identity.
In the Registered Servers section, click theReady to use Managed IDtile. This tile displays a list of servers that have a system-assigned managed identity. If your server is not listed, perform the steps toEnable a system-assigned managed identity on your registered servers.
In the Registered Servers section, click theReady to use Managed IDtile. This tile displays a list of servers that have a system-assigned managed identity. If your server is not listed, perform the steps toEnable a system-assigned managed identity on your registered servers.
To check if your registered servers have a system-assigned managed identity, run the following PowerShell command:
Get-AzStorageSyncServer -ResourceGroupName <string> -StorageSyncServiceName <string>
Get-AzStorageSyncServer -ResourceGroupName <string> -StorageSyncServiceName <string>
Verify theLatestApplicationIdproperty has a GUID which indicates the server has a system-assigned managed identity but is not currently configured to use the managed identity.
If the value for theActiveAuthTypeproperty isCertificateand theLatestApplicationIddoes not have a GUID, the server does not have a system-assigned managed identity and will use shared keys to authenticate to the Azure file share.
Note
Once a server is configured to use the system-assigned managed identity by following the steps in the following section, theLatestApplicationIdproperty is no longer used (will be empty), theActiveAuthTypeproperty value will be changed toManagedIdentity, and theApplicationIdproperty will have a GUID which is the system-assigned managed identity.
Configure your Azure File Sync deployment to use system-assigned managed identities
Portal
PowerShell
To configure the Storage Sync Service and registered servers to use system-assigned managed identities, perform the following steps in the portal:
Go to yourStorage Sync Servicein the Azure portal, expandSettingsand selectManaged identity.
Go to yourStorage Sync Servicein the Azure portal, expandSettingsand selectManaged identity.
ClickTurn on Managed identityto begin setup.

More information
Once the Storage Sync Service and registered server(s) are configured to use a system-assigned managed identity:
New endpoints (cloud or server) that are created will use a system-assigned managed identity to authenticate to the Azure file share.
When you need to configure additional registered servers to use managed identities, go to the Managed identity blade in the portal and click Turn on Managed identity or use the Set-AzStorageSyncServiceIdentity PowerShell cmdlet.
