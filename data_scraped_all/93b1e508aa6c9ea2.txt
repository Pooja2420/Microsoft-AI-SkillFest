Configure DHCP for Azure VMware Solution

Applications and workloads running in a private cloud environment require name resolution and DHCP services for lookup and IP address assignments. A proper DHCP and DNS infrastructure are required to provide these services. You can configure a virtual machine to provide these services in your private cloud environment.
Use the DHCP service built-in to NSX-T Data Center or use a local DHCP server in the private cloud instead of routing broadcast DHCP traffic over the WAN back to on-premises.
Important
If you advertise a default route to the Azure VMware Solution, then you must allow the DNS forwarder to reach the configured DNS servers and they must support public name resolution.
In this article, learn how to use NSX Manager to configure DHCP for Azure VMware Solution in one of the following ways:
Use the Azure portal to create a DHCP server or relay
Use the Azure portal to create a DHCP server or relay
Use NSX to host your DHCP server
Use NSX to host your DHCP server
Use a third-party external DHCP server

Tip
If you want to configure DHCP using a simplified view of NSX operations, seeConfigure DHCP for Azure VMware Solution.
Important
For clouds created on or after July 1, 2021, the simplified view of NSX operations must be used to configure DHCP on the default Tier-1 Gateway in your environment.
DHCP does not work for virtual machines (VMs) on the VMware HCX L2 stretch network when the DHCP server is in the on-premises datacenter.  NSX, by default, blocks all DHCP requests from traversing the L2 stretch. For the solution, see theConfigure DHCP on L2 stretched VMware HCX networksprocedure.
Use the Azure portal to create a DHCP server or relay
You can create a DHCP server or relay directly from Azure VMware Solution in the Azure portal. The DHCP server or relay connects to the Tier-1 gateway created when you deployed Azure VMware Solution. All the segments where you gave DHCP ranges are part of this DHCP. After you create a DHCP server or DHCP relay, you must define a subnet or range on segment level to consume it.

Specify the DHCP IP address range
When you create a relay to a DHCP server, you need to specify the DHCP IP address range.
Note
The IP address range shouldn't overlap with the IP range used in other virtual networks in your subscription and on-premises networks.

Use a third-party external DHCP server
If you want to use a third-party external DHCP server, create a DHCP relay service in NSX Manager. You need to specify the DHCP IP address range.
