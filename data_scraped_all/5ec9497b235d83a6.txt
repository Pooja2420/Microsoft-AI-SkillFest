Important
These virtual machines are in public preview and not recommended for production usage. Please sign up at aka.ms/acc/v6preview for access.
These VMs are available in West Europe, East US, West US and West US 3.
The ECesv6-series areAzure confidential VMsthat can be used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your code and data while it's being processed in the public cloud. Organizations can use these VMs to seamlessly bring confidential workloads to the cloud without any code changes to the application.
These machines are powered by IntelÂ® 5th Generation XeonÂ® Scalable processors reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.0 GHz andIntelÂ® Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX)for AI acceleration.
FeaturingIntelÂ® Trust Domain Extensions (TDX), these VMs are hardened from the cloud virtualized environment by denying the hypervisor, other host management code and administrators access to the VM memory and state. It helps to protect VMs against a broad range of sophisticatedhardware and software attacks.
These VMs have native support forconfidential disk encryptionmeaning organizations can encrypt their VM disks at boot with either a customer-managed key (CMK), or platform-managed key (PMK). This feature is fully integrated withAzure KeyVaultorAzure Managed HSMwith validation for FIPS 140-2 Level 3.
Note
There are somepricing differences based on your encryption settingsfor confidential VMs.
Note
Certain applications which are time sensitive may experience asynchronous time at VM boot. Whilst a long-term fix is in development, aworkaround is availablefor Linux customers today. If you need additional support, please create a support request.
ECesv6-series feature support
Supportedfeatures in ECesv6-series VMs:
Premium Storage
Premium Storage caching
VM Generation 2
Unsupportedfeatures in ECesv6-series VMs:
Live Migration
Memory Preserving Updates
Accelerated Networking
Nested Virtualization
ECesv6-series
The ECesv6 VMs offer even higher memory to vCPU ratio and an all new VM size with up to 64 vCPUs and 512 GiB of RAM. These VMs are ideal for memory intensive applications, large relational database servers, business intelligence applications, and critical applications that process sensitive and regulated data.
This series supports Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. Billing for disk storage and VMs is separate. To estimate your costs, use thePricing Calculator.

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toReadOnlyorReadWrite.  For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toNone.

Expected network bandwidthis the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth.Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines. To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
