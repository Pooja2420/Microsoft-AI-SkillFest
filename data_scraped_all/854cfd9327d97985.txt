Returns a unique identifier that identifies the data shard ("extent") that the current record resides in at the time the query was run.
Applying this function to calculated data that isn't attached to a data shard returns an empty guid (all zeros).
Deprecated aliases:extentid()
Caution
The value returned by this function isn't guaranteed to remain stable over time. The system continuously performs data grooming operations in the background
and these can result with changes to existing extents and their IDs.

Example
The following example shows how to get a list of all the data shards
that currently have records from an hour ago with a specific value for the
columnActivityId. It demonstrates that some query operators (here,
thewhereoperator, and alsoextendandproject)
preserve the information about the data shard hosting the record.
ActivityId

| where Timestamp > ago(1h)
