Remarks
Each step runs in its own process on an agent and has access to the pipeline workspace on a local hard drive.
This behavior means environment variables aren't preserved between steps but file system changes are.
All tasks and steps support a set of common properties, such asenabledandenv,in addition to their task or step specific properties. For more information on configuring these properties, seeTask control optionsandTask environment variables.
