Each project is based on a process that defines the building blocks for tracking work. The first project you create uses one of the default processesâAgile,Basic,Scrum, orCMMI.
You can only customize inherited processes. Any changes you make to the inherited process automatically appear in the projects that use that process. You can quickly customize a process by adding or modifying a work item type (WIT) that's part of the process. Otherwise, use the following sequence to customize a project:
Customize an inherited process:Modify the inherited process to align with your specific requirements by modifying fields, WITs, workflows, forms, and backlogs.
Verify your customizations:Create a test project and validate your changes.
Apply inherited process to a project:Add a new project based on inherited process and change the process used by an existing team project.
Refresh and verify your customizations:Refresh the web portal and open a work item of the type you modified.
Important
The Inheritance process model is available for projects configured to support it. If youâre using an older collection, check the process model compatibility. If your on-premises collection is configured to use the on-premises XML process model, you can only use that process model to customize the work tracking experience. For more information, seeChoose the process model for your project collection.
Note
Review changes made to an inherited process through the audit log. For more information, seeAccess, export, and filter audit logs.
Prerequisites
For guidance on tailoring Azure Boards to align with your specific business requirements, seeAbout configuring and customizing Azure Boards.
Note
When you customize an inherited process, any projects using that process automatically reflect the customizations. To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend creating a test process and project, which allows you to test your customizations before you implement them organization-wide. For more information, seeCreate and manage inherited processes.
Add or modify a field
Lockedfields and inheritedfields correspond to inherited fields from a system process. You can't customize locked fields, but you can customize some options for inherited fields. You can fully customize fields that you add to a process.

Add or modify a rule for a work item type
Add rules to support specific workflow and business use cases. Rules let you clear the value of a field, copy a value into a field, and apply values based on dependencies between different fields' values.
Select your inherited process and the work item type.
SelectRules>New rule.

For more information, seeRules and rule evaluation.
Add or modify work item types
You use different WITs to plan and track different types of work. The main reason you add a custom WIT is to customize the web form and workflow states to meet specific business use cases.
Select your inherited process and the WIT you want to customize.

From theWork Item Typespage, choose theNew work item type.
From theWork Item Typespage, choose theNew work item type.

Name the WIT and optionally specify a description, icon, and color. The icon and color you specify appear throughout the web portal, including on the work item form and when associated work items appear on a backlog, boards, query results, and more.

Modify the workflow of a work item type
Workflow states allow you to track the status of a work item as it moves from new to completed.
To modify a workflow, choose your inherited process, the WIT, and then theStatespage.

Add a custom control
Custom controls provide more functionality to a work item form.
From theProcesspage, select your inherited process > WIT >Add custom control.

For more information, seeAdd extensions and custom controls to a work item type.

Add an extension to a work item type
An extension is an installable unit that contributes new capabilities to your project.
Note
Group and Page extensions automatically get added to all WITs for all processes, both system and inherited. You can hide an extension for selected WITs within an inherited process.
Go to theVisual Studio Marketplace, find an extension, and selectGet it free.

Return to the process and WIT and verify the extension is where you want it. You can drag it to where you want it on the form.

Modify the backlog and boards
You can add more WITs to a backlog level or create another portfolio backlog. For instance, consider the following example:
We introduced a third-level portfolio backlog calledInitiatives, specifically designed to track the customInitiativeWIT.
We also renamed the product backlog toStoriesandTickets, signifying that it now encompasses bothUser storiesandCustomer tickets.

From theProcesspage, select your inherited process >Backlog levels.

Verify your customization
We recommend that you create a test project and apply your customized inherited process to it to verify the changes you made. All customizations made to a process go into effect immediately on all projects. If you want to stage your changes, you can do that using one of two methods:
Create a test project and copy of your customized process
Create a test organization and import/export your process

Create a test project and copy your customized process
From theProcesspage, select the â¦ context menu for the process you want to use, and then selectNew team project.

From your project, selectBoards>Work Items, and then select the customized WIT from theNew Work Itemdropdown menu.
In the following example, we selectBug.

Create a test organization and import/export your process
You can also use the following steps to verify the customizations you made to an inherited process.
Create a test organization.
Use theimport/export process toolto copy the process to the test organization.
Verify the process customizations in the test organization.
Use the import/export process tool again to import the modified process to the production organization.
Change your project's process
