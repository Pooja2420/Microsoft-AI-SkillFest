Event Grid is a fully managed service that enables you to easily manage events across many different Azure services and applications. It simplifies building event-driven and serverless applications. For an overview of the service, seeEvent Grid overview.
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.
When you're finished, you see that the event data is sent to the web app.

Create a message endpoint
Before subscribing to the events for the Blob storage, let's create the endpoint for the event message. Typically, the endpoint takes actions based on the event data. To simplify this quickstart, you deploy aprebuilt web appthat displays the event messages. The deployed solution includes an App Service plan, an App Service web app, and source code from GitHub.
SelectDeploy to Azureto deploy the solution to your subscription.

View your web app again, and notice that a subscription validation event is sent to it. Select the eye icon to expand the event data. Event Grid sends the validation event so the endpoint can verify that it wants to receive event data. The web app includes code to validate the subscription.

Now, let's trigger an event to see how Event Grid distributes the message to your endpoint.
Send an event to your endpoint
You trigger an event for the Blob storage by uploading a file. The file doesn't need any specific content.
In the Azure portal, navigate to your Blob storage account, and selectContainerson the let menu.

You triggered the event, and Event Grid sent the message to the endpoint you configured when subscribing. The message is in the JSON format and it contains an array with one or more events. In the following example, the JSON message contains an array with one event. View your web app and notice that ablob createdevent was received.

Clean up resources
If you plan to continue working with this event, don't clean up the resources created in this article. Otherwise, delete the resources you created in this article.
Select the resource group, and selectDelete resource group.
