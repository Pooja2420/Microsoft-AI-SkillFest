This article provides an overview of the curated environments in Azure Machine Learning, detailing their benefits and usage. Curated environments are provided by Azure Machine Learning and are available in your workspace by default. The curated environments rely on cached Docker images that use the latest version of the Azure Machine Learning SDK. Using a curated environment can reduce the run preparation cost and allow for faster deployment time. Use these environments to quickly get started with various machine learning frameworks.
Note
Use thePython SDK,CLI, or Azure Machine Learningstudioto get the full list of environments and their dependencies. For more information, see theenvironments article.
