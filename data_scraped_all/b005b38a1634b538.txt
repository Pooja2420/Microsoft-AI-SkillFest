In today's collaborative work environments, multiple teams often need to access and manage the same monitoring dashboards. Whether it's a DevOps team monitoring application performance or a support team troubleshooting customer issues, having the right access permissions is crucial. Azure Managed Grafana simplifies this process by allowing you to set varying levels of permissions for your team members and identities.
This guide walks you through the supported Grafana roles and shows you how to use roles and permission settings to share the relevant access permissions with your team members and identities.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
An Azure Managed Grafana workspace. If you don't have one yet,create an Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
You must have Grafana Admin permissions on the workspace.
Learn about Grafana roles
Azure Managed Grafana supportsAzure role-based access control (RBAC), an authorization system that lets you manage individual access to your Azure resources.
Azure RBAC enables you to allocate varying permission levels to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities, for managing your Azure Managed Grafana resources.
The following built-in roles are available in Azure Managed Grafana, each providing different levels of access:
To access the Grafana user interface, users must possess one of the roles above. You can find more information about the Grafana roles from theGrafana documentation. The Grafana Limited Viewer role in Azure maps to the "No Basic Role" in the Grafana docs.
Assign a Grafana role
Grafana user roles and assignments are fullyintegrated within Microsoft Entra ID. You can assign a Grafana role to any Microsoft Entra user, group, service principal, or managed identity, and grant them access permissions associated with that role. You can manage these permissions from the Azure portal or the command line. This section explains how to assign Grafana roles to users in the Azure portal.

Tip
When onboarding a new user to your Azure Managed Grafana workspace, granting them the Grafana Limited Viewer role allows them limited access to the Grafana workspace.
You can then grant the user access to each relevant dashboard and data source using their management settings. This method ensures that users with the Grafana Limited Viewer role only access the specific components they need, enhancing security and data privacy.
Edit permissions for specific component elements
Edit permissions for specific components such as dashboards, folders, and data sources from the Grafana user interface following these steps:
Open the Grafana portal and navigate to the component for which you want to manage permissions.
Go toSettings>Permissions>Add a permission.
UnderAdd permission for, select a user, service account, team, or role, and assign them the desired permission level: view, edit, or admin.
