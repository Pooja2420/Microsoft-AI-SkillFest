The scope of this article is to describe configurations, that will enable outbound connectivity to public end point(s). The configurations are mainly in the context of High Availability with Pacemaker for SUSE / RHEL.
If you are using Pacemaker with Azure fence agent in your high availability solution, then the VMs must have outbound connectivity to the Azure management API. The article presents several options to enable you to select the option that is best suited for your scenario.
Overview
When implementing high availability for SAP solutions via clustering, one of the necessary components isAzure Load Balancer. Azure offers two load balancer SKUs: standard and basic.
Standard Azure load balancer offers some advantages over the Basic load balancer. For instance, it works across Azure Availability zones, it has better monitoring and logging capabilities for easier troubleshooting, reduced latency. The âHA portsâ feature covers all ports, that is, it is no longer necessary to list all individual ports.
There are some important differences between the basic and the standard SKU of Azure load balancer. One of them is the handling of outbound traffic to public end point. For full Basic versus Standard SKU load balancer comparison, seeLoad Balancer SKU comparison.
When VMs without public IP addresses are placed in the backend pool of internal (no public IP address) Standard Azure load balancer, there is no outbound connectivity to public end points, unless additional configuration is done.
If a VM is assigned a public IP address, or the VM is in the backend pool of a load balancer with public IP address, it will have outbound connectivity to public end points.
SAP systems often contain sensitive business data. It is rarely acceptable for VMs hosting SAP systems to be accessible via public IP addresses. At the same time, there are scenarios, which would require outbound connectivity from the VM to public end points.
Examples of scenarios, requiring access to Azure public end point are:
Azure Fence Agent requires access tomanagement.azure.comandlogin.microsoftonline.com
Azure Backup
Azure Site Recovery
Using public repository for patching the Operating system
The SAP application data flow may require outbound connectivity to public end point
If your SAP deployment doesnât require outbound connectivity to public end points, you donât need to implement the additional configuration. It is sufficient to create internal standard SKU Azure Load Balancer for your high availability scenario, assuming that there is also no need for inbound connectivity from public end points.
Note
When VMs without public IP addresses are placed in the backend pool of internal (no public IP address) Standard Azure load balancer, there will be no outbound internet connectivity, unless additional configuration is performed to allow routing to public end points.If the VMs have either public IP addresses or are already in the backend pool of Azure Load balancer with public IP address, the VM will already have outbound connectivity to public end points.

Option 1: Additional external Azure Standard Load Balancer for outbound connections to internet
One option to achieve outbound connectivity to public end points, without allowing inbound connectivity to the VM from public end point, is to create a second load balancer with public IP address, add the VMs to the backend pool of the second load balancer and define onlyoutbound rules.UseNetwork Security Groupsto control the public end points, that are accessible for outbound calls from the VM.For more information, see Scenario 2 in documentOutbound connections.The configuration would look like:

Important considerations
You can use one additional Public Load Balancer for multiple VMs in the same subnet to achieve outbound connectivity to public end point and optimize cost
UseNetwork Security Groupsto control which public end points are accessible from the VMs. You can assign the Network Security Group either to the subnet, or to each VM. Where possible, useService tagsto reduce the complexity of the security rules.
Azure standard Load balancer with public IP address and outbound rules allows direct access to public end point. If you have corporate security requirements to have all outbound traffic pass via centralized corporate solution for auditing and logging, you may not be able to fulfill the requirement with this scenario.
Tip
Where possible, useService tagsto reduce the complexity of the Network Security Group .

Option 2: Azure Firewall for outbound connections to internet
Another option to achieve outbound connectivity to public end points, without allowing inbound connectivity to the VM from public end points, is with Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall is a managed service, with built-in High Availability and it can span multiple Availability Zones.You will also need to deployUser Defined Route, associated with subnet where VMs and the Azure load balancer are deployed, pointing to the Azure firewall, to route traffic through the Azure Firewall.For details on how to deploy Azure Firewall, seeDeploy And Configure Azure Firewall.
The architecture would look like:

Important considerations
Azure firewall is cloud native service, with built-in High Availability and it supports zonal deployment.
Requires additional subnet that must be named AzureFirewallSubnet.
If transferring large data sets outbound of the virtual network where the SAP VMs are located, to a VM in another virtual network, or to public end point, it may not be cost effective solution. One such example is copying large backups across virtual networks. For details see Azure Firewall pricing.
If the corporate Firewall solution is not Azure Firewall, and you have security requirements to have all outbound traffic pass though centralized corporate solution, this solution may not be practical.
Tip
Where possible, useService tagsto reduce the complexity of the Azure Firewall rules.

Option 3: Using Proxy for Pacemaker calls to Azure Management API
You could use proxy to allow Pacemaker calls to the Azure management API public end point.
Important considerations
If there is already corporate proxy in place, you could route outbound calls to public end points through it. Outbound calls to public end points will go through the corporate control point.
Make sure the proxy configuration allows outbound connectivity to Azure management API:https://management.azure.comandhttps://login.microsoftonline.com
https://management.azure.com
https://login.microsoftonline.com
Make sure there is a route from the VMs to the Proxy
Proxy will handle only HTTP/HTTPS calls. If there is additional need to make outbound calls to public end point over different protocols (like RFC), alternative solution will be needed
The Proxy solution must be highly available, to avoid instability in the Pacemaker cluster
Depending on the location of the proxy, it may introduce additional latency in the calls from the Azure Fence Agent to the Azure Management API. If your corporate proxy is still on the premises, while your Pacemaker cluster is in Azure, measure latency and consider, if this solution is suitable for you
If there isnât already highly available corporate proxy in place, we do not recommend this option as the customer would be incurring extra cost and complexity. Nevertheless, if you decide to deploy additional proxy solution, for the purpose of allowing outbound connectivity from Pacemaker to Azure Management public API, make sure the proxy is highly available, and the latency from the VMs to the proxy is low.
Pacemaker configuration with Proxy
There are many different Proxy options available in the industry. Step-by-step instructions for the proxy deployment are outside of the scope of this document. In the example below, we assume that your proxy is responding toMyProxyServiceand listening to portMyProxyPort.To allow pacemaker to communicate with the Azure management API, perform the following steps on all cluster nodes:
Edit the pacemaker configuration file /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker and add the following lines (all cluster nodes):sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker
# Add the following lines
http_proxy=http://MyProxyService:MyProxyPort
https_proxy=http://MyProxyService:MyProxyPort
Edit the pacemaker configuration file /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker and add the following lines (all cluster nodes):
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker
# Add the following lines
http_proxy=http://MyProxyService:MyProxyPort
https_proxy=http://MyProxyService:MyProxyPort
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker
# Add the following lines
http_proxy=http://MyProxyService:MyProxyPort
https_proxy=http://MyProxyService:MyProxyPort
Restart the pacemaker service onallcluster nodes.

Other options
If outbound traffic is routed via third party, URL-based firewall proxy:
if using Azure fence agent make sure the firewall configuration allows outbound connectivity to the Azure management API:https://management.azure.comandhttps://login.microsoftonline.com
