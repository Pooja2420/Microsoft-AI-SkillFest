The types of monitoring data you can collect for this service.
Ways to analyze that data.
Note
If you're already familiar with this service and/or Azure Monitor and just want to know how to analyze monitoring data, see theAnalyzesection near the end of this article.
When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you need to monitor and get alerts for your system. The Azure Monitor service collects and aggregates metrics and logs from every component of your system. Azure Monitor provides you with a view of availability, performance, and resilience, and notifies you of issues. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, or client libraries to set up and view monitoring data.
For more information on Azure Monitor, see theAzure Monitor overview.
For more information on how to monitor Azure resources in general, seeMonitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor.
Monitoring methods
There are several ways to monitor Azure Data Factory.
Azure Data Factory Studio
You can monitor all of your Data Factory pipeline runs natively in Azure Data Factory Studio. To open the monitoring experience, selectLaunch Studiofrom your Data Factory page in the Azure portal, and in Azure Data Factory Studio, selectMonitorfrom the left menu.
For more information about monitoring in Azure Data Factory Studio, see the following articles:
Visually monitor Azure Data Factory
Data flow monitoring
Monitor copy activity
Session log in a Copy activity
Azure portal
You can also monitor Azure Data Factory directly from the Azure portal. Several metrics graphs appear on the Azure portalOverviewpage for your Data Factory. On the left sidebar menu, you can access the AzureActivity log, or selectAlerts,Metrics,Diagnostic settings, orLogsfrom theMonitoringsection.
Monitor programmatically
You can monitor Data Factory pipelines programmatically by using .NET, PowerShell, Python, or the REST API. For more information, see the following articles:
Programmatically monitor Azure Data Factory
Set up diagnostics logs via the Azure Monitor REST API
Resource types
Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine isMicrosoft.Compute/virtualMachines. For a list of services and their associated resource types, seeResource providers.
Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also callednamespaces. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.
For more information about the resource types for Azure Data Factory, seeData Factory monitoring data reference.
Data storage
For Azure Monitor:
Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.
You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.
Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage,hosted partner systems, andnon-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs.
For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, seeAzure Monitor data platform.
Store Data Factory pipeline run data
Data Factory stores pipeline run data for only 45 days. Use Azure Monitor to route diagnostic logs if you want to keep the data longer.
Route data to Log Analytics if you want to analyze it with complex queries, create custom alerts, or monitor across data factories. You can route data from multiple data factories to a single Log Analytics workspace.
You can use a storage account or event hub namespace that isn't in the subscription of the resource that emits logs. The user who configures the setting must have appropriate Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) access to both subscriptions.

Azure Monitor platform metrics
Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:
Individually defined for each namespace.
Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
Used to track the performance of a resource over time.
Collection:Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.
Routing:You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check theDS exportsetting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.
For more information, see theMetrics diagnostic setting.
To configure diagnostic settings for a service, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, seeSupported metrics in Azure Monitor.
For a list of available metrics for Data Factory, seeData Factory monitoring data reference.

Azure Monitor resource logs
Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.
Collection:Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create adiagnostic settingand route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.
Routing:The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, seeAzure resource logsandResource log destinations.
For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, seeDiagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, seeSupported resource logs in Azure Monitor.
All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined inAzure Monitor resource log schema.
For the available Data Factory resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the logs schemas, seeData Factory monitoring data reference.

Azure activity log
The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.
Collection:Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.
Routing:You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, seeOverview of the Azure activity log.
Monitor integration runtimes
Integration runtime is the compute infrastructure Data Factory uses to provide data integration capabilities across different network environments. Data Factory offers several types of integration runtimes:
Azure integration runtime
Self-hosted integration runtime
Azure-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) integration runtime
Apache Airflow integration runtime
Azure Monitor collects metrics and diagnostics logs for all types of integration runtimes. For detailed instructions on monitoring integration runtimes, see the following articles:

For detailed instructions on configuring diagnostic logs by using the REST API, seeSet up diagnostic logs via the Azure Monitor REST API.

Kusto queries
You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).
Important
When you selectLogsfrom the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu. SeeLog query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analyticsfor details.
For a list of common queries for any service, see theLog Analytics queries interface.
For example queries, selectLogsunderMonitoringin the left navigation of your Data Factory page in the Azure portal, and then select theQueriestab. Here are some example queries:

Alerts
Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, seeAzure Monitor alerts.
There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, seeSample log alert queries. TheAzure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).
The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, seeCommon alert schema.
Types of alerts
You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, seeChoose the right monitoring alert type.
The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:
Metric alertsevaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.
Log alertsallow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.
Activity log alertstrigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.
Some Azure services also supportsmart detection alerts,Prometheus alerts, orrecommended alert rules.
For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, seeMonitor multiple resources with one alert rule.
Data Factory alert rules
To create and manage alerts, selectAlertsunderMonitoringin the left navigation of your Data Factory page in the Azure portal.
The following table lists popular alert rules for Data Factory. This is just a recommended list. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry that's listed in theData Factory monitoring data reference.
Notifications provide proactive alerting during or after execution of a pipeline.

Advisor recommendations
For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the serviceOverviewpage in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert inAdvisor recommendationsunderMonitoringin the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.
