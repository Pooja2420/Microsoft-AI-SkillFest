Key Vault Contributor
Manage key vaults, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, and does not allow you to access secrets, keys, or certificates.

Important
When using the Access Policy permission model, a user with theContributor,Key Vault Contributor, or any other role that includesMicrosoft.KeyVault/vaults/writepermissions for the key vault management plane can grant themselves data plane access by setting a Key Vault access policy. To prevent unauthorized access and management of your key vaults, keys, secrets, and certificates, it's essential to limit Contributor role access to key vaults under the Access Policy permission model. To mitigate this risk, we recommend you use theRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) permission model, which restricts permission management to the 'Owner' and 'User Access Administrator' roles, allowing a clear separation between security operations and administrative duties. See theKey Vault RBAC GuideandWhat is Azure RBAC?for more information.
