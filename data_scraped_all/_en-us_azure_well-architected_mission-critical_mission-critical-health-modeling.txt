Health modeling and observability are essential concepts to maximize reliability, which focuses on robust and contextualized instrumentation and monitoring. These concepts provide critical insight into application health, promoting the swift identification and resolution of issues.
Most mission-critical applications are significant in terms of both scale and complexity and therefore generate high volumes of operational data, which makes it challenging to evaluate and determine optimal operational action. Health modeling ultimately strives to maximize observability by augmenting raw monitoring logs and metrics with key business requirements to quantify application health, driving automated evaluation of health states to achieve consistent and expedited operations.
This design area focuses on the process to define a robust health model, mapping quantified application health states through observability and operational constructs to achieve operational maturity.
Important
This article is part of theAzure Well-Architected mission-critical workloadseries. If you aren't familiar with this series, we recommend you start withwhat is a mission-critical workload?
There are three main levels of operational maturity when striving to maximize reliability.

Layered application health
To build a health model, first define  application health in the context of key business requirements by quantifying âhealthyâ and âunhealthyâ states in a layered and measurable format. Then, for each  application component, refine the definition in the context of a steady running state and aggregated according to the application user flows. Superimpose with key non-functional business requirements for performance and availability. Finally, aggregate the health states for each individual user flow to form an acceptable representation of the overall application health. Once established, these layered health definitions should be used to inform critical monitoring metrics across all system components and validate operational subsystem composition.
Important
When defining what 'unhealthy' states, represent for all levels of the application. It's important to distinguish between transient and non-transient failure states to qualify service degradation relative to unavailability.
Design considerations
The process of modeling health is a top-down design activity that starts with an architectural exercise to define all user flows and map dependencies between functional and logical components, thereby implicitly mapping dependencies between Azure resources.

A health model is entirely dependent on the context of the solution it represents, and therefore can't be solved 'out-of-the-box' because 'one size doesn't fit all'.Applications will differ in composition and dependenciesMetrics and metric thresholds for resources must also be finely tuned in terms of what values represent healthy and unhealthy states, which are heavily influenced by encompassed application functionality and target non-functional requirements.

A layered health model enables application health to be traced back to lower level dependencies, which helps to quickly root cause service degradation.

To capture health states for an individual component, that component's distinct operational characteristics must be understood under a steady state that is reflective of production load. Performance testing is therefore a key capability to define and continually evaluate application health.

Failures within a cloud solution may not happen in isolation. An outage in a single component may lead to several capabilities or additional components becoming unavailable.Such errors may not be immediately observable.

Design recommendations
Define a measurable health model as a priority to ensure a clear operational understanding of the entire application.The health model should be layered and reflective of the application structure.The foundational layer should consider individual application components, such as  Azure resources.Foundational components should be aggregated alongside key non-functional requirements to build a business-contextualized lens into the health of system flows.System flows should be aggregated with appropriate weights based on business criticality to build a meaningful definition of overall application health. Financially significant or customer-facing user flows should be prioritized.Each layer of the health model should capture what âhealthyâ and âunhealthyâ states represent.Ensure the heath model can distinguish between transient and non-transient unhealthy states to isolate service degradation from unavailability.

Represent health states using a granular health score for every distinct application component and every user flow by aggregating health scores for mapped dependent components, considering key non-functional requirements as coefficients.The health score for a user flow should be represented by the lowest score across all mapped components, factoring in relative attainment against non-functional requirements for the user flow.The model used to calculate health scores must consistently reflect operating health, and if not, the model should be adjusted and redeployed to reflect new learnings.Define health score thresholds to reflect health status.

Example - Layered health model
This is a simplified representation of a layered application health model for illustrative purposes. A comprehensive and contextualized health model is provided in the Mission-Critical reference implementations:
Mission-Critical Online
Mission-Critical Connected
When implementing a health model it's important to define the health of individual components through the aggregation and interpretation of key resource-level metrics. An example of how resource metrics can be used is the image below:

This definition of health can subsequently be represented by a KQL query, as demonstrated by the example query below that aggregates InsightsMetrics (Container insights) and AzureMetrics (diagnostics setting for AKS cluster) and compares (inner join) against modeled health thresholds.
// ClusterHealthStatus
let Thresholds=datatable(MetricName: string, YellowThreshold: double, RedThreshold: double) [
    // Disk Usage:
    "used_percent", 50, 80,
    // Average node cpu usage %:
    "node_cpu_usage_percentage", 60, 90,
    // Average node disk usage %:
    "node_disk_usage_percentage", 60, 80,
    // Average node memory usage %:

    ];

| project TimeGenerated,Computer, Namespace, MetricName = Name, Value=Val
| extend NodeName = extract("([a-z0-9-]*)(-)([a-z0-9]*)$", 3, Computer)
| union (
    AzureMetrics
    | extend ResourceType = extract("(PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.)([A-Z]*/[A-Z]*)", 2, ResourceId)
    | where ResourceType == "CONTAINERSERVICE/MANAGEDCLUSTERS"
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by MetricName
    | project TimeGenerated, MetricName, Namespace = "AzureMetrics", Value=Average
    )
| lookup kind=inner Thresholds on MetricName
| extend IsYellow = iff(Value > YellowThreshold and Value < RedThreshold, 1, 0)
| extend IsRed = iff(Value > RedThreshold, 1, 0)

| extend IsRed = iff(Value > RedThreshold, 1, 0)
| project NodeName, MetricName, Value, YellowThreshold, IsYellow, RedThreshold, IsRed
The resulting table output can subsequently be transformed into a health score for easier aggregation at higher levels of the health model.
// ClusterHealthScore
ClusterHealthStatus
| summarize YellowScore = max(IsYellow), RedScore = max(IsRed)
| extend HealthScore = 1-(YellowScore*0.25)-(RedScore*0.5)
// ClusterHealthScore
ClusterHealthStatus
| summarize YellowScore = max(IsYellow), RedScore = max(IsRed)
| extend HealthScore = 1-(YellowScore*0.25)-(RedScore*0.5)
These aggregated scores can subsequently be represented as a dependency chart using visualization tools such as Grafana to illustrate the health model.
This image shows an example layered health model from the Azure Mission-Criticalonline reference implementation, and demonstrates how a change in health state for a foundational component can have a cascading impact to user flows and overall application health (the example values correspond to the table in the previous image).

Unified data sink for correlated analysis
Many operational datasets must be gathered from all system components to accurately represent a defined heath model, considering logs and metrics from both application components and underlying Azure resources. This vast amount of data ultimately needs to be stored in a format that allows for near-real time interpretation to facilitate swift operational action. Moreover, correlation across all encompassed data sets is required to ensure effective analysis is unbounded, allowing for the layered representation of health.
A unified data sink is required to ensure all operational data is swiftly stored and made available for correlated analysis to build a 'single pane' representation of application health. Azure provides several different operational technologies under the umbrella ofAzure Monitor, and the Log Analytics workspace serves as the core Azure-native data sink to store and analyze operational data.

Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is enabled by default for all Azure subscriptions, but Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics workspace) and Application Insights resources must be deployed and configured to incorporate data collection and querying capabilities.

It's not uncommon for regulatory controls to require operational data remains within originating geographies or countries/regions.  Regulatory requirements may stipulate the retention of critical data types for an extended period of time. For example, in regulated banking, audit data must be retained for at least seven years.

Different operational data types may require different retention periods. For example, security logs may need to be retained for a long period, while performance data is unlikely to require long-term retention outside the context of AIOps.

Design recommendations
Use Log Analytics workspace as a unified data sink to provide a 'single pane' across all operational data sets.Decentralize Log Analytics workspaces across all used deployment regions. Each Azure region with an application deployment should consider a Log Analytics workspace to gather all operational data originating from that region. All global resources should use a separate dedicated Log Analytics workspace, which should be deployed within a primary deployment region.Sending all operational data to a single Log Analytics workspace would create a single point of failure.Requirements for data residency might prohibit data leaving the originating region, and federated workspaces solves for this requirement by default.There's a substantial egress cost associated with transferring logs and metrics across regions.All deployment stamps within the same region can use the same regional Log Analytics workspace.

Note
When deploying into an Azure landing zone,  if there's a requirement for centralized storage of operational data, you canforkdata at instantiation so it's ingested into both centralized tooling and Log Analytics workspaces dedicated to the application. Alternatively, expose access to application Log Analytics workspaces so that central teams can query application data. It's ultimately critical that operational data originating from the solution is available within Log Analytics workspaces dedicated to the application.

Visualization
Visually representing the health model with critical operational data is essential to achieve effective operations and maximize reliability. Dashboards should ultimately be utilized to provide near-real time insights into application health for DevOps teams, facilitating the swift diagnosis of deviations from steady state.
Microsoft provides several data visualization technologies, including Azure Dashboards, Power BI, and Azure Managed Grafana (currently in-preview). Azure Dashboards is positioned to provide a tightly integrated out-of-the-box visualization solution for operational data within Azure Monitor. It therefore has a fundamental role to play in the visual representation of operational data and application health for a mission-critical workload. However, there are several limitations in terms of the positioning of Azure Dashboards as a holistic observability platform, and as a result consideration should be given to the supplemental use of market-leading observability solutions, such as Grafana, which is also provided as a managed solution within Azure.
This section focuses on the use of Azure Dashboards and Grafana to build a robust dashboarding experience capable of providing technical and business lenses into application health, enabling DevOps teams and effective operation. Robust dashboarding is essential to diagnose issues that have already occurred, and support operational teams in detecting and responding to issues as they happen.
Design considerations

Automated incident response
While the visual representations of application health provide invaluable operational and business insights to support issue detection and diagnosis, it relies on the readiness and interpretations of operational teams, as well as the effectiveness of subsequent human-triggered responses. Therefore, to maximize reliability it's necessary to implement extensive alerting to detect proactively and respond to issues in near real-time.
Azure Monitorprovides an extensive alerting framework to detect, categorize, and respond to operational signals throughAction Groups. This section will therefore focus on the use of Azure Monitor alerts to drive automated actions in response to current or potential deviations from a healthy application state.
Important
Alerting and automated action is critical to effectively detect and swiftly respond to issues as they happen, before greater negative impact can occur. Alerting also provides a mechanism to interpret incoming signals and respond to prevent issues before they occur.
Design considerations
Alert rules are defined to fire when a conditional criteria is satisfied for incoming signals, which can include variousdata sources, such as metrics, log queries, or availability tests.

Alerts can be integrated within a layered health model by creating an Alert Rule for a saved log search query from the model's 'root' scoring function. For example, using 'WebsiteHealthScore' and alerting on a numeric value that represents an 'Unhealthy' state.

Respond to excessive resource utilization signals through automated scale operations, using Azure-native auto-scale capabilities where possible. Where built-in auto-scale functionality isn't applicable, use the component health score to model signals and determine when to respond with automated scale operations. Ensure automated scale operations are defined according to a capacity model, which quantifies scale relationships between components, so that scale responses encompass components that need to be scaled in relation to other components.

Predictive action and AI operations (AIOps)
Machine learning models can be applied to correlate and prioritize operational data, helping to gather critical insights related to filtering excessive alert 'noise' and predicting issues before they cause impact, as well as accelerating incident response when they do.
More specifically, an AIOps methodology can be applied to critical insights about the behavior of the system, users, and DevOps processes. These insights can include identifying a problem happening now (detect), quantifying why the problem is happening (diagnose), or signaling what will happen in the future (predict). Such insights can be used to drive actions that adjust and optimize the application to mitigate active or potential issues, using key business metrics, system quality metrics, and DevOps productivity metrics, to prioritize according to business impact. Conducted actions can themselves be infused into the system through a feedback loop that further trains the underlying model to drive additional efficiencies.

There are multiple analytical technologies within Azure, such as Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks, which can be used to build and train analytical models for AIOps. This section will therefore focus on how these technologies can be positioned within an application design to accommodate AIOps and drive predictive action, focusing on Azure Synapse that reduces friction by bringing together the best of Azure's data services along with powerful new features.
AIOps is used to drive predictive action, interpreting and correlating complex operational signals observed over a sustained period in order to better respond to and prevent issues before they occur.
