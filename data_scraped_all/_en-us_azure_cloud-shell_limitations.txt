Frequently asked questions
Is there a time limit for Cloud Shell sessions?
Cloud Shell is intended for interactive use cases. Cloud Shell sessions time out after 20 minutes
without interactive activity. As a result, any long-running non-interactive sessions are ended
without warning.
Cloud Shell is a free service for managing your Azure environment. It's not a general purpose
computing platform. Excessive usage might be considered a breach of the Azure Terms of Service,
which result in having your access to Cloud Shell blocked.
How many concurrent sessions can I have open?
Azure Cloud Shell has a limit of 20 concurrent users per tenant. Opening more than 20 simultaneous
sessions produces a "Tenant User Over Quota" error. If you have a legitimate need to have more than
20 sessions open, such as for training sessions, contact Support to request a quota increase before
your anticipated usage date.
I created some files in Cloud Shell, but they're gone. What happened?
The machine that provides your Cloud Shell session is temporary and is recycled after your session
is inactive for 20 minutes.
When you started Cloud Shell the first time, you were prompted to choose a storage option.
If you chose theMount storage accountoption, Cloud Shell mounts an Azure fileshare to theclouddrivefolder in your session. Files stored in theclouddrivefolder are visible in the
Azure portal using Storage browser. Files stored in theclouddrivefolder persist across
sessions.

If you chose theNo storage account requiredoption, you can only write files to your$HOMEfolder.
If you chose theNo storage account requiredoption, you can only write files to your$HOMEfolder.
$HOME
In both scenarios, you can write files to the$HOMEfolder. However, the$HOMEfolder only
exists in the Cloud Shell container image that you're currently using. Files in the$HOMEfolder
aren't visible in the Storage browser and are deleted when your session ends.

I create a file in the Azure: drive, but I don't see it. What happened?
Cloud Shell loads a PowerShell provider for Azure that presents Azure resource data as a file system
drive. PowerShell users can use theAzure:drive to access Azure resources. TheAzure:drive is
a virtual drive that doesn't allow you to create files.

I want to install a tool in Cloud Shell that requiressudo. Is that possible?
sudo
No. Your user account in Cloud Shell is an unprivileged account. You can't usesudoor run any
command that requires elevated permissions.

Storage Dialog - Error: 403 RequestDisallowedByPolicy
Details: When creating the Cloud Shell storage account for first-time users, it's
unsuccessful due to an Azure Policy assignment placed by your admin. The error message includes:The resource action 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write' is disallowed by
one or more policies.

Storage Dialog - Error: 400 DisallowedOperation
Details: You can't create the Cloud Shell storage account when using a Microsoft Entra
subscription.
Resolution: Microsoft Entra ID subscriptions aren't able to create Azure resources. Use an
Azure subscription capable of creating storage resources.
Terminal output - Error: Failed to connect terminal
Details: Cloud Shell requires the ability to establish a websocket connection to Cloud Shell
infrastructure.
Resolution: Confirm that your network allows sending HTTPS and websocket requests to the
following domains:*.console.azure.com*.servicebus.windows.net*.servicebus.usgovcloudapi.netfor Azure Government Cloud

Failed to request a terminal - Accessing Cloud Shell from a network that uses a private DNS resolver
Details: Cloud Shell uses Azure Relay for terminal connections. Cloud Shell can fail to
request a terminal due to DNS resolution problems. This failure can be caused when you launch a
Cloud Shell session from a host in a network that has a private DNS Zone for theservicebusdomain. This error can also occur if you're using a private on-premises DNS server.

Resolution: You can add a DNS record for the Azure Relay instance that Cloud Shell uses.The following steps show you how to identify the DNS name of the Cloud Shell instance and how to
create a DNS record for that name.Try to start Cloud Shell using your web browser. Use the browser's Developer Tools to find the
Azure Relay instance name. In Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, hit theF12key to
open the Developer Tools. Select theNetworktab. Find theSearchbox in the top right
corner. Search forterminals?to find the request for a Cloud Shell terminal. Select the one
of the request entries found by the search. In theHeaderstab, find the hostname in theRequest URL. The name is similar toccon-prod-<region-name>-aci-XX.servicebus.windows.net. For Azure Government Cloud, the
hostname ends withservicebus.usgovcloudapi.net.The following screenshot shows the Developer Tools in Microsoft Edge for a successful request
for a terminal. The hostname isccon-prod-southcentalus-aci-02.servicebus.windows.net. In
your case, the request should be unsuccessful, but you can find the hostname you need to
resolve.For information about accessing the Developer Tools in other browsers, seeCapture a browser trace for troubleshooting.From a host outside of your private network, run thenslookupcommand to find the IP address
of the hostname as found in the previous step.nslookup ccon-prod-southcentalus-aci-02.servicebus.windows.netThe results should look similar to the following example:Server:         168.63.129.16

Terminal output - Sorry, your Cloud Shell failed to provision: {"code":"TenantDisabled" ...}
Details: In rare cases, Azure might flag out-of-the-ordinary resource consumption based in
from Cloud Shell as fraudulent activity. When this occurs, Azure disables Cloud Shell at the
tenant level and you see the following error message:Sorry, your Cloud Shell failed to provision: {"code":"TenantDisabled","message":"Cloud Shell has
been disabled in directory<>."} Please refresh the page.There can be legitimate use cases where CPU usage in your Azure Cloud Shell instance exceeds the
thresholds that trigger fraud prevention and block your tenant. Large AZCopy jobs could be the
cause this event. The Microsoft Azure engineering team can help to figure out why the tenant was
disabled and re-enable it.

You can delete this personal data by resetting your user settings. Resetting user settings
terminates your current session and unmounts your linked storage account. The Azure fileshare used
by Cloud Shell isn't deleted.
When reconnecting to Cloud Shell, you're prompted to attach a storage account. You can create a new
storage account or reattach the existing storage account that you used previously.
Use the following steps to delete your user settings.
Launch Cloud Shell.
Select theSettingsmenu (gear icon) from the Cloud Shell toolbar.
SelectReset user settingsfrom the menu.
Select theResetbutton to confirm the action.
Block Cloud Shell in a locked down network environment
Details: Administrators might wish to disable access to Cloud Shell for their users. Cloud

access to Cloud Shell's entry points includingportal.azure.com,shell.azure.com, Visual
Studio Code Azure Account extension, andlearn.microsoft.com. In the US Government cloud, the
entry point isux.console.azure.us; there's no correspondingshell.azure.us.
