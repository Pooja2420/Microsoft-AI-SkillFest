Azure Firewall Manager is a platform to manage and protect your network resources at scale. You can associate your virtual networks with a DDoS protection plan within Azure Firewall Manager.
Tip
DDoS Protection currently doesn't support virtual WANs. However, you can work around this limitation by force tunneling Internet traffic to an Azure Firewall in a virtual network that has a DDoS Protection Plan associated with it.
Under a single tenant, DDoS protection plans can be applied to virtual networks across multiple subscriptions. For more information about DDoS protection plans, seeAzure DDoS Protection overview.
To see how this works, you create a firewall policy and then a virtual network secured with an Azure Firewall. Then you create a DDoS Protection Plan and then associate it with the virtual network.
Create a firewall policy
Use Firewall Manager to create a firewall policy.
From theAzure portal, open Firewall Manager.
SelectAzure Firewall Policies.
SelectCreate Azure Firewall Policy.
ForResource group, selectCreate newand typeDDoS-Test-rg.
UnderPolicy details,Name, typefw-pol-01.
ForRegion, selectWest US 2.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Create a secured virtual network
Use Firewall Manager to create a secured virtual network.
Open Firewall Manager.
SelectVirtual Networks.
SelectCreate new Secured Virtual Network.
ForResource group, selectDDoS-Test-rg.
ForRegion, selectWest US 2.
ForHub Virtual Network Name, typeHub-vnet-01.
ForAddress range, type10.0.0.0/16.
SelectNext : Azure Firewall.
ForPublic IP address, selectAdd newand typefw-pipfor the name and selectOK.
ForFirewall subnet address space, type10.0.0.0/24.
ForAzure Firewall tier, selectPremium.
Select thefw-pol-01for theFirewall Policy.
SelectNext : Review + create.
SelectCreate.
Create a DDoS Protection Plan
Create a DDoS Protection Plan using Firewall Manager. You can use theDDoS Protection Planspage to create and manage your Azure DDoS Protection Plans.
Open Firewall Manager.
SelectDDoS Protection Plans.
SelectCreate.
ForResource group, selectDDos-Test-rg.
UnderInstance details,Name, typeDDoS-plan-01.
ForRegion, selectWest US 2.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Associate a DDoS Protection Plan
Now you can associate the DDoS Protection Plan with the secured virtual network.
Open Firewall Manager.
SelectVirtual Networks.
Select the check box forHub-vnet-01.
SelectManage Security,Manage DDoS Protection Plan.
ForDDoS Protection Plan Standard, selectEnable.
ForDDoS protection plan, selectDDoS-plan-01.
SelectSave.
After the deployment completes, selectRefresh.
You should now see that the virtual network has an associated DDoS Protection Plan.
