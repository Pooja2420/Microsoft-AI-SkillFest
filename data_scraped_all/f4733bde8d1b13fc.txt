Configure WordPress add-ins
In the Add-ins tab, recommended settings are already enabled by default:
Managed Identities remove the overhead of managing sensitive credentials to access Azure resources, making your website highly secure.
Azure Communication Service enables application-to-person, high-volume emails with Azure Communication Services.
Azure Content Delivery Network helps in improving performance, availability, and security by using a distributed network of servers that can store cached content in point-of-presence locations, close to end users.
Azure Front Door (AFD) provides dynamic site acceleration that reduces response times while also allowing content delivery by caching at nearest edge servers for faster media downloads.
Azure Blob Storage allows you to store and access images, videos and other files. This effectively reduces the load on your web server thereby improving performance and user experience.
