"OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service â one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever â enabling high reliability and low maintenance."
â Satya Nadella, Microsoft chairman and chief executive officer
Today's applications are required to be highly responsive and always online. They must respond in real time to large changes in usage at peak hours, store ever increasing volumes of data, and make this data available to users in milliseconds. To achieve low latency and high availability, instances of these applications need to be deployed in datacenters that are close to their users.
The surge of AI-powered applications created another layer of complexity, because many of these applications integrate a multitude of data stores. For example, some organizations built applications that simultaneously connect to MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, and Gremlin. These databases differ in implementation workflow and operational performances, posing extra complexity for scaling applications.
Azure Cosmos DB simplifies and expedites your application development by being the single database for your operational data needs, fromgeo-replicated distributed cachingto backup storage, tovector indexing and search. It provides the data infrastructure for modern applications likeAI agent, digital commerce, Internet of Things, and booking management. It can accommodate all your operational data models, including relational, document, vector, key-value, graph, and table.
An AI database providing industry-leading capabilities...
...for free
Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL, relational, and vector database. It offers single-digit millisecond response times, automatic and instant scalability, along with guaranteed speed at any scale. Business continuity is assured withSLA-backedavailability and enterprise-grade security.
App development is faster and more productive thanks to:
Turnkey multi-region data distribution anywhere in the world
Open source APIs
SDKs for popular languages
AI database functionalities like integrated vector database or seamless integration with Azure AI Services to support Retrieval Augmented Generation
Query Copilot for generating NoSQL queries based on your natural language prompts (preview)
As a fully managed service, Azure Cosmos DB takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates, and patching. It also handles capacity management with cost-effective serverless and automatic scaling options that respond to application needs to match capacity with demand.
The following free options are available:
Azure Cosmos DB lifetime free tierprovides 1000RU/sof throughput and 25 GB of storage free.
Azure AI Advantageoffers 40,000RU/sof throughput for 90 days (equivalent of up to $6,000) to Azure AI or GitHub Copilot customers.
Try Azure Cosmos DB freefor 30 days without creating an Azure account; no commitment follows when the trial period ends.
When you decide that Azure Cosmos DB is right for you, you can receive up to 63% discount onAzure Cosmos DB prices through Reserved Capacity.

...for more than just AI apps
Besides AI, Azure Cosmos DB should also be your goto database for a variety of use cases, includingretail and marketing,IoT and telematics,gaming,social, andpersonalization, among others. Azure Cosmos DB is well positioned for solutions that handle massive amounts of data, reads, and writes at aâ¯global scaleâ¯with near-real response times. Azure Cosmos DB'sâ¯guaranteed high availability, high throughput, low latency, and tunable consistency are huge advantages when building these types of applications.
Flexible Schema for Iterative Development.For example, apps wanting to adopt flexible modern DevOps practices and accelerate feature deployment timelines.
Latency sensitive workloads.For example, real-time Personalization.
Highly elastic workloads.For example, concert booking platform.
High throughput workloads.For example, IoT device state/telemetry.
Highly available mission critical workloads.For example, customer-facing Web Apps.
Analytical workloads (OLAP).For example, interactive, streaming, and batch analytics to enable Data Scientist / Data Analyst scenarios. Consider Microsoft Fabric instead.
Highly relational apps.For example, white-label CRM applications. Consider Azure SQL, Azure Database for MySQL, or Azure Database for PostgreSQL instead.
