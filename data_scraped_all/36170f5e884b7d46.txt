Azure Load Balancer rules have a default timeout range of 4 minutes to 100 minutes for Load Balancer rules, Outbound Rules, and Inbound NAT rules. The default setting is 4 minutes. If a period of inactivity is longer than the timeout value, there's no guarantee that the TCP or HTTP session is maintained between the client and your service.
The following sections describe how to change idle timeout and tcp reset settings for load balancer resources.
Set tcp reset and idle timeout
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
To set the idle timeout and tcp reset for a load balancer, edit the load-balanced rule.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the left-hand menu, selectResource groups.
Select the resource group for your load balancer. In this example, the resource group is namedmyResourceGroup.
Select your load balancer. In this example, the load balancer is namedmyLoadBalancer.
InSettings, selectLoad balancing rules.
Select your load-balancing rule. In this example, the load-balancing rule is namedmyLBrule.
In the load-balancing rule, input your timeout value intoIdle timeout (minutes).
UnderTCP reset, selectEnabled.
SelectSave.
To set the idle timeout and tcp reset, set values in the following load-balancing rule parameters withSet-AzLoadBalancer:
IdleTimeoutInMinutes
EnableTcpReset
If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.4.1 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Azto find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module. If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to runConnect-AzAccountto create a connection with Azure.
Get-Module -ListAvailable Az
Connect-AzAccount
Replace the following examples with the values from your resources:
myResourceGroup
myLoadBalancer
$lb = Get-AzLoadBalancer -Name "myLoadBalancer" -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup"
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].IdleTimeoutInMinutes = '15'
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].EnableTcpReset = 'true'
Set-AzLoadBalancer -LoadBalancer $lb
$lb = Get-AzLoadBalancer -Name "myLoadBalancer" -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup"
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].IdleTimeoutInMinutes = '15'
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].EnableTcpReset = 'true'
Set-AzLoadBalancer -LoadBalancer $lb
To set the idle timeout and tcp reset, use the following parameters foraz network lb rule update:
--idle-timeout
--enable-tcp-reset
Validate your environment before you begin:
Sign in to the Azure portal and check that your subscription is active by runningaz login.

Check your version of the Azure CLI in a terminal or command window by runningaz --version. For the latest version, see thelatest release notes.If you don't have the latest version, update your installation by following theinstallation guide for your operating system or platform.
az --version
If you don't have the latest version, update your installation by following theinstallation guide for your operating system or platform.
Replace the following examples with the values from your resources:
myResourceGroup
myLoadBalancer
myLBrule
az network lb rule update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myLBrule \
    --lb-name myLoadBalancer \
    --idle-timeout 15 \
    --enable-tcp-reset true
az network lb rule update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myLBrule \
    --lb-name myLoadBalancer \
    --idle-timeout 15 \
    --enable-tcp-reset true
