Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure Services (for example, Managed HSM, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB etc.) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network.
An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.
For more information, seeWhat is Azure Private Link?
Note
Managed HSM does not support IP rules orVirtual Network Service Endpoints
Prerequisites
To integrate a managed HSM with Azure Private Link, you need:
A Managed HSM. For more information, seeProvision and activate a managed HSM using Azure CLI.
An Azure virtual network.
A subnet in the virtual network.
Owner or contributor permissions for both the managed HSM and the virtual network.
The Azure CLI version 2.25.0 or later. Runaz --versionto find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall the Azure CLI.
az --version
Your private endpoint and virtual network must be in the same region. When you select a region for the private endpoint using the portal, it automatically filters only virtual networks that are in that region. Your HSM can be in a different region.
Your private endpoint uses a private IP address in your virtual network.
Establish a private link connection to Managed HSM using CLI (Initial Setup)
az login                                                                   # Login to Azure CLI
az account set --subscription {SUBSCRIPTION ID}                            # Select your Azure Subscription
az group create -n {RESOURCE GROUP} -l {REGION}                            # Create a new Resource Group
az provider register -n Microsoft.KeyVault                                 # Register KeyVault as a provider
az keyvault update-hsm --hsm-name {HSM NAME} -g {RG} --default-action deny # Turn on firewall

az network vnet create -g {RG} -n {vNet NAME} --location {REGION}           # Create a Virtual Network

    # Create a Subnet
az network vnet subnet create -g {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --name {subnet NAME} --address-prefixes {addressPrefix}

    # Disable Virtual Network Policies
az network vnet subnet update --name {subnet NAME} --resource-group {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies true

    # Create a Private DNS Zone
az network private-dns zone create --resource-group {RG} --name privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net

    # Link the Private DNS Zone to the Virtual Network
az network private-dns link vnet create --resource-group {RG} --virtual-network {vNet NAME} --zone-name privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net --name {dnsZoneLinkName} --registration-enabled true
az login                                                                   # Login to Azure CLI
az account set --subscription {SUBSCRIPTION ID}                            # Select your Azure Subscription
az group create -n {RESOURCE GROUP} -l {REGION}                            # Create a new Resource Group
az provider register -n Microsoft.KeyVault                                 # Register KeyVault as a provider
az keyvault update-hsm --hsm-name {HSM NAME} -g {RG} --default-action deny # Turn on firewall

az network vnet create -g {RG} -n {vNet NAME} --location {REGION}           # Create a Virtual Network

    # Create a Subnet
az network vnet subnet create -g {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --name {subnet NAME} --address-prefixes {addressPrefix}

    # Disable Virtual Network Policies
az network vnet subnet update --name {subnet NAME} --resource-group {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies true

    # Create a Private DNS Zone
az network private-dns zone create --resource-group {RG} --name privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net

    # Link the Private DNS Zone to the Virtual Network
az network private-dns link vnet create --resource-group {RG} --virtual-network {vNet NAME} --zone-name privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net --name {dnsZoneLinkName} --registration-enabled true
Allow trusted services to access Managed HSM
When the firewall is turned on, all access to the HSM from any location that is not using a private endpoints connection is denied, including public Internet and Azure services. Use--bypass AzureServicesoption if you want to allow Microsoft services to access your keys in your Managed HSM. The individual entities (such as an Azure Storage account or an Azure SQL Server) still need to have specific role assignments in place to be able to access a key.
--bypass AzureServices
Note
Only specific trusted services usage scenarios are supported. For more information, refer to thelist of trusted services usage scenarios.
az keyvault update-hsm --hsm-name {HSM NAME} -g {RG} --default-action deny --bypass AzureServices
az keyvault update-hsm --hsm-name {HSM NAME} -g {RG} --default-action deny --bypass AzureServices
Create a Private Endpoint (Automatically Approve)
az network private-endpoint create --resource-group {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --subnet {subnet NAME} --name {Private Endpoint Name}  --private-connection-resource-id "/subscriptions/{AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHSMs/{HSM NAME}" --group-id managedhsm --connection-name {Private Link Connection Name} --location {AZURE REGION}
az network private-endpoint create --resource-group {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --subnet {subnet NAME} --name {Private Endpoint Name}  --private-connection-resource-id "/subscriptions/{AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHSMs/{HSM NAME}" --group-id managedhsm --connection-name {Private Link Connection Name} --location {AZURE REGION}
Note
If you delete this HSM the private endpoint stops working. If your recover (undelete) this HSM later, you must re-create a new private endpoint.
Create a Private Endpoint (Manually Request Approval)
az network private-endpoint create --resource-group {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --subnet {subnet NAME} --name {Private Endpoint Name}  --private-connection-resource-id "/subscriptions/{AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHSMs/{HSM NAME}" --group-id managedhsm --connection-name {Private Link Connection Name} --location {AZURE REGION} --manual-request
az network private-endpoint create --resource-group {RG} --vnet-name {vNet NAME} --subnet {subnet NAME} --name {Private Endpoint Name}  --private-connection-resource-id "/subscriptions/{AZURE SUBSCRIPTION ID}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHSMs/{HSM NAME}" --group-id managedhsm --connection-name {Private Link Connection Name} --location {AZURE REGION} --manual-request

Add Private DNS Records
# Determine the Private Endpoint IP address
az network private-endpoint show -g {RG} -n {PE NAME}      # look for the property networkInterfaces then id; the value must be placed on {PE NIC} below.
az network nic show --ids {PE NIC}                         # look for the property ipConfigurations then privateIpAddress; the value must be placed on {NIC IP} below.

# https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-cli#create-an-additional-dns-record
az network private-dns zone list -g {RG}
az network private-dns record-set a add-record -g {RG} -z "privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net" -n {HSM NAME} -a {NIC IP}
az network private-dns record-set list -g {RG} -z "privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net"

# From home/public network, you wil get a public IP. If inside a vnet with private zone, nslookup will resolve to the private ip.
nslookup {HSM NAME}.managedhsm.azure.net
nslookup {HSM NAME}.privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net
# Determine the Private Endpoint IP address
az network private-endpoint show -g {RG} -n {PE NAME}      # look for the property networkInterfaces then id; the value must be placed on {PE NIC} below.
az network nic show --ids {PE NIC}                         # look for the property ipConfigurations then privateIpAddress; the value must be placed on {NIC IP} below.

# https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-cli#create-an-additional-dns-record
az network private-dns zone list -g {RG}
az network private-dns record-set a add-record -g {RG} -z "privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net" -n {HSM NAME} -a {NIC IP}
az network private-dns record-set list -g {RG} -z "privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net"

# From home/public network, you wil get a public IP. If inside a vnet with private zone, nslookup will resolve to the private ip.
nslookup {HSM NAME}.managedhsm.azure.net
nslookup {HSM NAME}.privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net
Validate that the private link connection works
You should validate that the resources within the same subnet of the private endpoint resource are connecting to your HSM over a private IP address, and that they have the correct private DNS zone integration.
First, create a virtual machine by following the steps inCreate a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal
In the "Networking" tab:
Specify Virtual network and Subnet. You can create a new virtual network or select an existing one. If selecting an existing one, make sure the region matches.
Specify a Public IP resource.
In the "NIC network security group", select "None".
In the "Load balancing", select "No".
Open the command line and run the following command:
nslookup <your-HSM-name>.managedhsm.azure.net
nslookup <your-HSM-name>.managedhsm.azure.net
If you run the ns lookup command to resolve the IP address of a managed HSM over a public endpoint, you see a result that looks like this:
c:\ >nslookup <your-hsm-name>.managedhsm.azure.net

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    
Address:  (public IP address)
Aliases:  <your-hsm-name>.managedhsm.azure.net
c:\ >nslookup <your-hsm-name>.managedhsm.azure.net

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    
Address:  (public IP address)
Aliases:  <your-hsm-name>.managedhsm.azure.net
If you run the ns lookup command to resolve the IP address of a managed HSM over a private endpoint, you see a result that looks like this:
c:\ >nslookup your_hsm_name.managedhsm.azure.net

Address:  10.1.0.5 (private IP address)
Aliases:  <your-hsm-name>.managed.azure.net
          <your-hsm-name>.privatelink.managedhsm.azure.net
c:\ >nslookup your_hsm_name.managedhsm.azure.net
