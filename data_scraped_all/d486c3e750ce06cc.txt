Scenario details
There are important reasons why companies should replace their COBOL and mainframe systems:
Scarcity of domain experience:Developers who understand COBOL and mainframe technology are retiring, and few developers are trained to replace them. The talent pool gets steadily smaller and the costs and risks of relying on COBOL rise.
Limited flexibility:COBOL and the underlying systems that support it weren't designed for modern cloud-based applications. They're inflexible and hard to integrate.
Exorbitant costs:IBM mainframe hardware and software costs are high. Licensing and maintenance fees for ancillary mainframe applications and databases are rising.
Thereisa way forward for COBOL and mainframe systems. Astadiaâs automated COBOL refactoring solution delivers cloud-enabled applications and databases that do the same things as their legacy counterparts. The refactored applications run as Azure applications in virtual machines provided by Azure Virtual Machines. Azure ExpressRoute makes them available to users, and Azure Load Balancer distributes the load.
Refactoring reduces costs and allows for deeper integration and for customization to meet business requirements. The hassles and costs of COBOL and the mainframe give way to a new world of quality and scalability that includes:
Automated testing and quality assurance.
Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployment and orchestration.
The refactoring solution creates applications that:
Are functionally equivalent to their original counterparts.
Are written in your choice of Java or C#.
Follow object-oriented concepts and paradigms.
Are easy to maintain.
Perform as well as the applications they replace, or better.
Are cloud-ready.
Are delivered using a standard DevOps toolchain and best practices.
The refactoring process includes flow normalization, code restructuring, data layer extraction, data remodeling, and packaging for reconstruction. It identifies cloned code and replaces it with shared objects for simpler maintenance and manageability. The process also identifies and removes dead code by analyzing data and control dependencies.
Java and C# developers adapt refactored applications for cloud optimization by using standard DevOps tools and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) concepts. Such tools and methods arenât available for mainframe applications. Optimization delivers efficiencies and business benefits such as elasticity, granular service definition, and easy integration with cloud-native services.
Potential use cases
Automated refactoring is available for most COBOL dialects and platforms, including z/OS, OpenVMS, and VME. Candidates for using it include organizations seeking to:
Modernize infrastructure and escape the high costs, limitations, and rigidity of  mainframe systems.
Avoid the risks of shortages of COBOL and mainframe developers.
Reduce operational costs and capital expenditures.
Move mainframe workloads to the cloud without the costs and risks of prolonged manual rewrites.
Migrate mission-critical applications to the cloud while maintaining continuity with other on-premises applications.
Make their systems horizontally and vertically scalable.
Implement disaster recovery techniques.
Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
The architecture uses Site Recovery to mirror VMs to a secondary Azure region for quick failover and disaster recovery if an Azure datacenter fails.
The auto-failover groups feature of SQL Database provides data protection by managing database replication and failover to the secondary region. For more information, seeAuto-failover groups overview and best practices (Azure SQL Database).
Resiliency is built into this solution by using Load Balancer. If one presentation or transaction server fails, other servers run the workloads.
We recommend that you create availability sets for your VMs to increase availability. For more information, seeAvailability sets overview.
We recommend that you use geo-replication to increase reliability. For more information, seeAzure Storage redundancy.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
This solution uses an Azure network security group to manage traffic to and from Azure resources. For more information, seeNetwork security groups.
Private Link for Azure SQL Database provides a private, direct connection that's isolated to the Azure networking backbone and that runs between VMs and SQL Database.
Azure Bastion maximizes admin access security by minimizing open ports. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to virtual network VMs directly from the Azure portal over TLS.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
Azure avoids unnecessary costs by identifying the correct number of resource types, analyzing spending over time, and scaling in advance to meet business needs without overspending.
Azure minimizes costs by running on VMs. You can turn off the VMs that aren't being used, and provide a schedule for known usage patterns. For more information about cost optimization for VMs, seeVirtual Machines.
The VMs in this architecture use either Premium SSD or Ultra Disk Storage. For more information about disk options and pricing, seeManaged Disks pricing.
SQL Database optimizes costs with serverless compute and Hyperscale storage resources that automatically scale. For more information about SQL Database options and pricing, seeAzure SQL Database pricing.
Use thePricing calculatorto estimate costs for your implementation of this solution.
Operational Excellence
Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Operational Excellence.
Refactoring not only supports faster cloud adoption, but also promotes adoption of DevOps and agile development principles. You have full flexibility in development and production deployment options.
Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
This solution supports deployment in containers, VMs, or Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Containers and Virtual Machine Scale Sets, unlike VMs, scale out and in rapidly. Shifting the unit of scaling to containers optimizes infrastructure utilization.
