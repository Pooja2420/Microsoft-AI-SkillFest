Key Vault supports two types of resource: vaults and managed HSMs. This article is aboutManaged HSM. If you want to learn how to manage a vault, seeManage Key Vault using the Azure CLI.
This article provides practical instructions for managing roles and role assignments for a Managed HSM using the Azure CLI. It implements the role-based access control model described inAccess control for Managed HSMusing the built-in roles documented inLocal RBAC built-in roles for Managed HSM.
For an overview of Managed HSM, seeWhat is Managed HSM?. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
To allow a security principal (such as a user, a service principal, group or a managed identity) to perform managed HSM data plane operations, they must be assigned a role that permits performing those operations. For example, if you want to allow an application to perform a sign operation using a key, it must be assigned a role that contains the "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHSM/keys/sign/action" as one of the data actions. A role can be assigned at a specific scope. Managed HSM local RBAC supports two scopes, HSM-wide (/or/keys) and per key (/keys/<keyname>).
/
/keys
/keys/<keyname>
For a list of all Managed HSM built-in roles and the operations they permit, seeManaged HSM built-in roles.
Prerequisites
To use the Azure CLI commands in this article, you must have the following items:
A subscription to Microsoft Azure. If you don't have one, you can sign up for afree trial.

Create a new role assignment
Assign roles for all keys
Useaz keyvault role assignment createcommand to assign aManaged HSM Crypto Userrole to user identified by user principal nameuser2@contoso.comfor allkeys(scope/keys) in the ContosoHSM.
az keyvault role assignment create
/keys
az keyvault role assignment create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role "Managed HSM Crypto User" --assignee user2@contoso.com  --scope /keys
az keyvault role assignment create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role "Managed HSM Crypto User" --assignee user2@contoso.com  --scope /keys
Assign role for a specific key
Useaz keyvault role assignment createcommand to assign aManaged HSM Crypto Userrole to user identified by user principal nameuser2@contoso.comfor a specific key namedmyrsakey.
az keyvault role assignment create
az keyvault role assignment create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role "Managed HSM Crypto User" --assignee user2@contoso.com  --scope /keys/myrsakey
az keyvault role assignment create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role "Managed HSM Crypto User" --assignee user2@contoso.com  --scope /keys/myrsakey
List existing role assignments
Useaz keyvault role assignment listto list role assignments.
az keyvault role assignment list
All role assignments at scope / (default when no --scope is specified) for all users (default when no --assignee is specified)
az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM
az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM
All the role assignments at the HSM level for a specific useruser1@contoso.com.
az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --assignee user@contoso.com
az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --assignee user@contoso.com
Note
When scope is / (or /keys) the list command only lists all the role assignments at the top level and does not show role assignments at individual key level.
All role assignments for a specific useruser2@contoso.comfor a specific keymyrsakey.
az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --assignee user2@contoso.com --scope /keys/myrsakey
az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --assignee user2@contoso.com --scope /keys/myrsakey
A specific role assignment for roleManaged HSM Crypto Officerfor a specific useruser2@contoso.comfor a specific keymyrsakey

az keyvault role assignment list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --assignee user2@contoso.com --scope /keys/myrsakey --role "Managed HSM Crypto Officer"
Delete a role assignment
Useaz keyvault role assignment deletecommand to delete aManaged HSM Crypto Officerrole assigned to useruser2@contoso.comfor keymyrsakey2.
az keyvault role assignment delete
az keyvault role assignment delete --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role "Managed HSM Crypto Officer" --assignee user2@contoso.com  --scope /keys/myrsakey2
az keyvault role assignment delete --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role "Managed HSM Crypto Officer" --assignee user2@contoso.com  --scope /keys/myrsakey2
List all available role definitions
Useaz keyvault role definition listcommand to list all the role definitions.
az keyvault role definition list
az keyvault role definition list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM
az keyvault role definition list --hsm-name ContosoMHSM
Create a new role definition
Managed HSM has several built-in (pre-defined) roles that are useful for most common usage scenarios. You can define your own role with a list of specific actions that the role is allowed to perform. Then you can assign this role to principals to grant them the permission to the specified actions.
Useaz keyvault role definition createcommand to a role namedMy Custom Roleusing a JSON string.
az keyvault role definition create
az keyvault role definition create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role-definition '{
    "roleName": "My Custom Role",
    "description": "The description of the custom rule.",
    "actions": [],
    "notActions": [],
    "dataActions": [
        "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/read/action"
    ],
    "notDataActions": []
}'
az keyvault role definition create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role-definition '{
    "roleName": "My Custom Role",
    "description": "The description of the custom rule.",
    "actions": [],
    "notActions": [],
    "dataActions": [
        "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/read/action"
    ],
    "notDataActions": []
}'
Useaz keyvault role definition createcommand to a role from a file namedmy-custom-role-definition.jsoncontaining the JSON string for a role definition. See example above.
az keyvault role definition create
az keyvault role definition create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role-definition @my-custom-role-definition.json
az keyvault role definition create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role-definition @my-custom-role-definition.json
Show details of a role definition
Useaz keyvault role definition showcommand to see details of a specific role definition using name (a GUID).
az keyvault role definition show
az keyvault role definition show --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --name xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
az keyvault role definition show --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --name xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Update a custom role definition
Useaz keyvault role definition updatecommand to update a role namedMy Custom Roleusing a JSON string.
az keyvault role definition update
az keyvault role definition create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role-definition '{
            "roleName": "My Custom Role",
            "name": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "id": "Microsoft.KeyVault/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/xxxxxxxx-
        xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "description": "The description of the custom rule.",
            "actions": [],
            "notActions": [],
            "dataActions": [
                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/read/action",
                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/write/action",
                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/backup/action",
                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/create"
            ],
            "notDataActions": []
        }'
az keyvault role definition create --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --role-definition '{
            "roleName": "My Custom Role",
            "name": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "id": "Microsoft.KeyVault/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/xxxxxxxx-
        xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",

                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/write/action",
                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/backup/action",
                "Microsoft.KeyVault/managedHsm/keys/create"
            ],
            "notDataActions": []
        }'
Delete custom role definition
Use the Azure CLIaz keyvault role definition deletecommand to delete a custom role definition using name (a GUID).
az keyvault role definition delete --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --name xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
az keyvault role definition delete --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --name xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Note
Built-in roles cannot be deleted. When custom roles are deleted, all the role assignments using that custom role become defunct.
