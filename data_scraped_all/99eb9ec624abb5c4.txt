Rehost mainframe applications to Azure with Raincode compilers
This architecture shows how the Raincode COBOL compiler modernizes mainframe legacy applications by seamlessly migrating and integrating them with a modern, Azure-based technology stack without changing a single line of code. With Raincode's compiler technology, you can keep current optimized mainframe applications and deploy them on the cloud, allowing you to preserve decades of development while greatly enhancing performance and flexibility. Raincode's solution is aimed at transforming the mainframe to an Azure-native architecture by preserving the business logic while transforming the entire architecture. Raincode supports application flexibility across Linux and Windows with containerized or virtual machine (VM) deployments on Azure.
Architecture
Legacy IBM z/OS architecture
The following diagram shows an example of a legacy COBOL-based mainframe architecture, before migration to Azure.

The following annotations map from the source IBM z/OS to Azure:
A. IBM 3270 terminal emulation for demand and online users is replaced by a web browser to access system resources in Azure.
B. COBOL and other legacy application code is converted to C#/.NET. Raincode generates 100-percent thread-safe and managed code for .NET and .NET Core.
C. Raincode COBOL compiler modernizes mainframe legacy applications by seamlessly migrating and integrating them with a modern, cloud-based technology stack without changing a single line of code.
D. Workload automation, scheduling, reporting, and system monitoring functions can retain current platforms, as they are Azure capable today.
E. Legacy database structures like Db2 and IDMS can be migrated to Azure SQL Database with all the DR/HA capabilities that Azure provides. Raincode also supports static or dynamic SQL queries through SQL Server or on Azure SQL DB.
F. File structures (VSAM, flat files, virtual tape, and the like) map easily to Azure data constructs within structured files and/or blob storage. Features like redundant geographic replication and Azure Auto Failover Group Replication are available to provide data protection.
G. An optional printer subsystem manages on-premises printers.
H. z/OS running on Logical Partitions (LPARs).
I. LPARs represent a subset of a computer's hardware resources. Each LPAR can host a separate OS. While this example shows only Z/OS instances, other LPARs running on the same hardware can host other operating environments, like z/VM, or other engines, like zIIP or IFL.
Postmigration, Azure-based architecture
This diagram shows how the legacy architecture can be migrated to Azure, taking advantage of the Raincode compiler and many other modern Azure services.

User access provided over TLS port 443 for accessing web-based applications. Web-based Applications presentation layer can be kept virtually unchanged to minimize end user retraining. Alternatively, the web application presentation layer can be updated with modern UX frameworks as requirements necessitate.

Azure Virtual Network (VNet)is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own datacenter, but it brings more benefits of Azure's infrastructure, such as scale, availability, and isolation.

Azure Load Balanceroperates at layer four of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's the single point of contact for clients. Load Balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to back-end pool instances. These flows are according to configured load balancing rules and health probes. The back-end pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances in a virtual machine scale set.
