Billing role definitions
The following table describes the billing roles you use to manage your billing account, billing profiles, and invoice sections.
Billing account roles and tasks
A billing account is created when you sign up to use Azure. You use your billing account to manage invoices, payments, and track costs. Roles on the billing account have the highest level of permissions and users in these roles get visibility into the cost and billing information for your entire account. Assign these roles only to users that need to view invoices, and track costs for your entire account like member of the finance and the accounting teams. For more information, seeUnderstand billing account.
The following tables show what role you need to complete tasks in the context of the billing account.

The Global Administrator role is above the Billing Account Administrator. Global Administrators in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant can add or remove themselves as Billing Account Administrators at any time to the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

Billing profile roles and tasks
Each billing account has at least one billing profile. Your first billing profile is set up when you sign up to use Azure. A monthly invoice is generated for the billing profile and contains all its associated charges from the prior month. You can set up more billing profiles based on your needs. Users with roles on a billing profile can view cost, set budget, and manage and pay its invoices. Assign these roles to users who are responsible for managing budget and paying invoices for the billing profile like members of the business administration teams in your organization.
