Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets. You can securely store keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. Azure key vaults may be created and managed through the Azure portal. In this quickstart, you create a key vault, then use it to store a certificate. For more information on Key Vault, review theOverview.
Prerequisites
To access Azure Key Vault, you'll need an Azure subscription. If you don't already have a subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
All access to secrets takes place through Azure Key Vault. For this quickstart, create a key vault using theAzure portal,Azure CLI, orAzure PowerShell.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Add a certificate to Key Vault
To add a certificate to the vault, you just need to take a couple of additional steps. In this case, we add a self-signed certificate that could be used by an application. The certificate is calledExampleCertificate.
On the Key Vault properties pages, selectCertificates.
Click onGenerate/Import.
On theCreate a certificatescreen choose the following values:Method of Certificate Creation: Generate.Certificate Name: ExampleCertificate.Subject: CN=ExampleDomainLeave the other values to their defaults. (By default, if you don't specify anything special in Advanced policy, it'll be usable as a client auth certificate.)
Method of Certificate Creation: Generate.
Certificate Name: ExampleCertificate.
Subject: CN=ExampleDomain
Leave the other values to their defaults. (By default, if you don't specify anything special in Advanced policy, it'll be usable as a client auth certificate.)
ClickCreate.
Once that you receive the message that the certificate has been successfully created, you may click on it on the list. You can then see some of the properties. If you click on the current version, you can see the value you specified in the previous step.

Export certificate from Key Vault
By clicking "Download in CER format" or "Download in PFX/PEM format" button, you can download the certificate.
