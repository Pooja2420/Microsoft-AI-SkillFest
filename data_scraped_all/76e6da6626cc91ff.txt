NAT gateway configuration basics
Check the following configurations to ensure that NAT gateway can be used to direct traffic outbound:
At least one public IP address or one public IP prefix is attached to NAT gateway. At least one public IP address must be associated with the NAT gateway for it to provide outbound connectivity.
At least one public IP address or one public IP prefix is attached to NAT gateway. At least one public IP address must be associated with the NAT gateway for it to provide outbound connectivity.
At least one subnet is attached to a NAT gateway. You can attach multiple subnets to a NAT gateway for going outbound, but those subnets must exist within the same virtual network. NAT gateway can't span beyond a single virtual network.

How to validate connectivity
NAT gatewaysupports IPv4 User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocols.
Note
ICMP protocol is not supported by NAT Gateway. Ping using ICMP protocol isn't supported and is expected to fail.
To validate end-to-end connectivity of NAT gateway, follow these steps:
Validate that yourNAT gateway public IP address is being used.
Validate that yourNAT gateway public IP address is being used.
Conduct TCP connection tests and UDP-specific application layer tests.

How to analyze outbound connectivity
To analyze outbound traffic from NAT gateway, use virtual network (VNet) flow logs. VNet flow logs provide connection information for your virtual machines. The connection information contains the source IP and port and the destination IP and port and the state of the connection. The traffic flow direction and the size of the traffic in number of packets and bytes sent is also logged. The source IP and port specified in the VNet flow log is for the virtual machine and not the NAT gateway.
To learn more about VNet flow logs, seeVirtual network flow logs overview.
To learn more about VNet flow logs, seeVirtual network flow logs overview.
For guides on how to enable VNet flow logs, seeManage virtual network flow logs.

It is recommended to access the log data onLog Analytics workspaceswhere you can also query and filter the data for outbound traffic. To learn more about using Log Analytics, seeLog Analytics tutorial.

NAT gateway in a failed state
You can experience outbound connectivity failure if your NAT gateway resource is in a failed state. To get your NAT gateway out of a failed state, follow these instructions:
Identify the resource that is in a failed state. Go toAzure Resource Explorerand identify the resource in this state.

Update the toggle on the right-hand top corner to Read/Write.

Select on Edit for the resource in failed state.
Select on Edit for the resource in failed state.
Select on PUT followed by GET to ensure the provisioning state was updated to Succeeded.

You can then proceed with other actions as the resource is out of failed state.

Add or remove NAT gateway
Can't delete NAT gateway
NAT gateway must be detached from all subnets within a virtual network before the resource can be removed or deleted. SeeRemove NAT gateway from an existing subnet and delete the resourcefor step by step guidance.
Add or remove subnet
NAT gateway can't be attached to subnet already attached to another NAT gateway
A subnet within a virtual network can't have more than one NAT gateway attached to it for connecting outbound to the internet. An individual NAT gateway resource can be associated to multiple subnets within the same virtual network. NAT gateway can't span beyond a single virtual network.
Basic resources can't exist in the same subnet as NAT gateway
NAT gateway isn't compatible with basic resources, such as Basic Load Balancer or Basic Public IP. Basic resources must be placed on a subnet not associated with a NAT Gateway. Basic Load Balancer and Basic Public IP can be upgraded to standard to work with NAT gateway.
To upgrade a basic load balancer to standard, seeupgrade from basic public to standard public load balancer.
To upgrade a basic load balancer to standard, seeupgrade from basic public to standard public load balancer.
To upgrade a basic public IP to standard, seeupgrade from basic public to standard public IP.
To upgrade a basic public IP to standard, seeupgrade from basic public to standard public IP.
To upgrade a basic public IP with an attached virtual machine to standard, see [upgrade a basic public IP with an attached virtual machine](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-upgrade-virtual machine).
To upgrade a basic public IP with an attached virtual machine to standard, see [upgrade a basic public IP with an attached virtual machine](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-upgrade-virtual machine).
NAT gateway can't be attached to a gateway subnet
NAT gateway can't be deployed in a gateway subnet. A gateway subnet is used by a VPN gateway for sending encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and on-premises location. SeeVPN gateway overviewto learn more about how gateway subnets are used by VPN gateway.
Can't attach NAT gateway to a subnet that contains a virtual machine network interface in a failed state
When associating a NAT gateway to a subnet that contains a virtual machine network interface (network interface) in a failed state, you receive an error message indicating that this action can't be performed. You must first resolve the virtual machine network interface failed state before you can attach a NAT gateway to the subnet.
To get your virtual machine network interface out of a failed state, you can use one of the two following methods.
Determine the provisioning state of your network interfaces using theGet-AzNetworkInterface PowerShell commandand setting the value of the "provisioningState" to "Succeeded."

Add or remove public IP addresses
Can't exceed 16 public IP addresses on NAT gateway
NAT gateway can't be associated with more than 16 public IP addresses. You can use any combination of public IP addresses and prefixes with NAT gateway up to a total of 16 IP addresses. To add or remove a public IP, seeadd or remove a public IP address.
The following IP prefix sizes can be used with NAT gateway:
/28 (16 addresses)
/28 (16 addresses)
/29 (8 addresses)
/29 (8 addresses)
/30 (4 addresses)
/30 (4 addresses)
/31 (2 addresses)
/31 (2 addresses)
IPv6 coexistence
NAT gatewaysupports IPv4 UDP and TCP protocols. NAT gateway can't be associated to an IPv6 Public IP address or IPv6 Public IP Prefix. NAT gateway can be deployed on a dual stack subnet, but only uses IPv4 Public IP addresses for directing outbound traffic. Deploy NAT gateway on a dual stack subnet when you need IPv6 resources to exist in the same subnet as IPv4 resources. For more information about how to provide IPv4 and IPv6 outbound connectivity from your dual stack subnet, seeDual stack outbound connectivity with NAT gateway and public Load balancer.
Can't use basic public IPs with NAT gateway
NAT gateway is a standard resource and can't be used with basic resources, including basic public IP addresses. You can upgrade your basic public IP address in order to use with your NAT gateway using the following guidance:Upgrade a public IP address.
Can't use public IPs with internet routing preference together with NAT gateway
When NAT gateway is configured with a public IP address, traffic is routed via theMicrosoft network. NAT gateway can't be associated with public IPs with routing preference choiceInternet. NAT gateway can only be associated with public IPs with routing preference choiceMicrosoft Global Network. Seesupported servicesfor a list of all Azure services that do support public IPs with the Internet routing preference.
Can't mismatch zones of public IP addresses and NAT gateway
NAT gateway is azonal resourceand can either be designated to a specific zone or to "no zone." When NAT gateway is placed in "no zone," Azure places the NAT gateway into a zone for you, but you don't have visibility into which zone the NAT gateway is located.
NAT gateway can be used with public IP addresses designated to a specific zone, no zone, all zones (zone-redundant) depending on its own availability zone configuration.
Note
If you need to know the zone that your NAT gateway resides in, make sure to designate it to a specific availability zone.
Can't use DDoS protected public IPs with NAT gateway
NAT gateway doesn't support public IP addresses with DDoS protection enabled. DDoS protected IPs are generally more critical for inbound traffic, since most DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target's resources by flooding them with a large volume of incoming traffic. To learn more about DDoS protection, review the following articles below.
