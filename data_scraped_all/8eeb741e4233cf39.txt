Migrate failover cluster instance to SQL Server on Azure VMs
Article

This article teaches you to migrate your Always On failover cluster instance (FCI) to SQL Server on Azure VMs using theAzure Migrate: Server Migration tool. Using the migration tool, you can migrate each node in the failover cluster instance to an Azure VM hosting SQL Server, as well as the cluster and FCI metadata.
In this article, you learn how to:
Prepare Azure and source environment for migration.
Start replicating VMs.
Monitor replication.
Run a full VM migration.
Reconfigure SQL failover cluster with Azure shared disks.
This guide uses the agent-based migration approach of Azure Migrate, which treats any server or virtual machine as a physical server. When migrating physical machines, Azure Migrate: Server Migration uses the same replication architecture as the agent-based disaster recovery in the Azure Site Recovery service, and some components share the same code base. Some content might link to Site Recovery documentation.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, you should:
An Azure subscription. Create afree account, if necessary.
Install theAzure PowerShellAzmodule.
Az
Download thePowerShell samples scriptsfrom the GitHub repository.
Prepare Azure
Prepare Azure for migration with Server Migration.
To check you have proper permissions, follow these steps:
In the Azure portal, open the subscription, and selectAccess control (IAM).
InCheck access, find the relevant account, and select it to view permissions.
You should haveContributororOwnerpermissions.If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
If you need to assign permissions, follow the steps inPrepare for an Azure user account.
Prepare for migration
To prepare for server migration, you need to verify the server settings, and prepare to deploy a replication appliance.
Check machine requirements
Make sure machines comply with requirements for migration to Azure.
Verifyserver requirements.
Verify that source machines that you replicate to Azure comply withAzure VM requirements.
SomeWindowssources require a few additional changes. Migrating the source before making these changes could prevent the VM from booting in Azure. For some operating systems, Azure Migrate makes these changes automatically.
Prepare for replication
Azure Migrate: Server Migration uses a replication appliance to replicate machines to Azure. The replication appliance runs the following components:
Configuration server: The configuration server coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure, and manages data replication.
Process server: The process server acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption, and sends it to a cache storage account in Azure.
Prepare for appliance deployment as follows:
Create a Windows Server 2016 machine to host the replication appliance. Review themachine requirements.
The replication appliance uses MySQL. Review theoptionsfor installing MySQL on the appliance.
Review the Azure URLs required for the replication appliance to accesspublicandgovernmentclouds.
Reviewportaccess requirements for the replication appliance.
Note
The replication appliance should be installed on a machine other than the source machine you're replicating or migrating, and not on any machine that has had the Azure Migrate discovery and assessment appliance installed to before.
Download replication appliance installer

It might take some time after installation for discovered machines to appear in Azure Migrate: Server Migration. As VMs are discovered, theDiscovered serverscount rises.

Prepare source machines
To prepare source machines, you need information from the cluster.
Caution
Maintain disk ownership throughout the replication process until the final cutover. If there's a change in disk ownership, there's a chance that the volumes could be corrupted and replication would need to be to retriggered. Set the preferred owner for each disk to avoid transfer of ownership during the replication process.

To prepare source machines, do the following:
Identify disk ownership:Sign in to one of the cluster nodes and open Failover Cluster Manager. Identify the owner node for the disks to determine the disks that need to be migrated with each server.

Create load balancer
For the cluster and cluster roles to respond properly to requests, an Azure Load balancer is required. Without a load balancer, the other VMs are unable to reach the cluster IP address as it's not recognized as belonging to the network or the cluster.
Fill out the columns in theCluster-Config.csvfile:Column headerDescriptionNewIPSpecify the IP address in the Azure virtual network (or subnet) for each resource in the CSV file.ServicePortSpecify the service port to be used by each resource in the CSV file. For SQL cluster resource, use the same value for service port as the probe port in the CSV. For other cluster roles, the default values used are 1433 but you can continue to use the port numbers that are configured in your current setup.
Fill out the columns in theCluster-Config.csvfile:

Track and monitor
Replication proceeds in the following sequence:
When you selectReplicateaStart Replicationjob begins.
When theStart Replicationjob finishes successfully, the machines begin their initial replication to Azure.
After initial replication finishes, delta replication begins. Incremental changes to on-premises disks are periodically replicated to the replica disks in Azure.
After the initial replication is completed, configure the Compute and Network items for each VM. Clusters typically have multiple NICs but only one NIC is required for the migration (set the others as don't create).
You can track job status in the portal notifications.
You can monitor replication status by selecting onReplicating serversinAzure Migrate: Server Migration.

After machines are replicated, they are ready for migration. To migrate your servers, follow these steps:
In the Azure Migrate project >Servers>Azure Migrate: Server Migration, selectReplicating servers.
