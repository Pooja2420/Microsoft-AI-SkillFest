You can manage email notifications at team, project, and organization levels when changes occur to work items, code reviews, pull requests, source control files, and builds.
For example, when a high priority work item is assigned to your team's area path, a notification email gets sent to the team. For more information, seeNotification types.

For example, a push to a pull request (PR) could introduce a change to File1.cs. If thereâs a policy which says that Person A needs to review changes to File1.cs, theyâd be in the Changed reviewers role for that iteration of the PR.TheReset reviewersrole is related to the âreset votesâ policy. For example, the repo configured the policy, âReset votes on new pushesâ. Person B, who was required on the PR, already approved this PR. Because of the reset votes policy, their vote is reset. Thus, they're in the Reset reviewers role for that iteration.

Tip
If you don't want to receive a notification for an event that you initiated, you can turn on the option,Skip initiator. For more information, seeExclude yourself from notification emails for events that you initiate.
Manage global delivery settings
Global notifications apply to allprojectsdefined for an organization or collection.
Choose to allow or block delivery of emails for all subscriptions owned by a team or a group. It's a default setting, which applies only if the team or group hasn't explicitly set the option. For more information, seeGlobal notifications.
Tip
We don't support organization-wide notifications. As an alternative, you can provide an email distribution list that goes to your entire organization. Also, you can generate a banner with theaz devops banner commandthat all users see when they sign in.
Tip
You can send an email to all collections in an application tier. SeeConfigure an SMTP server and customize email for alerts and feedback requests. Also, you can generate a banner to communication with users without sending out mass emails. For more information, seeAdd and manage information banners in Azure DevOps.
