The Performance traffic routing method allows you to direct traffic to the endpoint with the lowest latency from the client's network. Typically, the region with the lowest latency is the closest in geographic distance. This traffic routing method can't account for real-time changes in network configuration or load.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create a resource group
Create a resource group for the Traffic Manager profile.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the left pane of the Azure portal, selectResource groups.
InResource groups, on the top of the page, selectAdd.
InResource group name, type a namemyResourceGroupTM1. ForResource group location, selectEast US, and then selectOK.
Create a Traffic Manager profile with performance routing method
Create a Traffic Manager profile that directs user traffic by sending them to the endpoint with lowest latency from the client's network.
On the top left-hand side of the screen, selectCreate a resource>Networking>Traffic Manager profile>Create.
On the top left-hand side of the screen, selectCreate a resource>Networking>Traffic Manager profile>Create.
InCreate Traffic Manager profile, enter or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then selectCreate:SettingValueNameEnter a unique name for your Traffic Manager profile.Routing methodSelect thePerformancerouting method.SubscriptionSelect your subscription.Resource groupSelectmyResourceGroupTM1.LocationThis setting refers to the location of the resource group, and has no impact on the Traffic Manager profile that will be deployed globally.
InCreate Traffic Manager profile, enter or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then selectCreate:

To configure performance routing method on an existing Traffic Manager profile
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the portalâs search bar, search for theTraffic Manager profilesand then select the profile name that you want to configure the routing method for.

In theSettingssection, selectConfiguration, and in theConfigurationblade, complete as follows:SettingValueRouting methodPerformanceDNS time to live (TTL)This value controls how often the clientâs local caching name server will query the Traffic Manager system for updated DNS entries.

To monitor endpoints, you must specify a path and filename. A forward slash "/" is a valid entry for the relative path and implies that the file is in the root directory (default).

Test the performance routing method
Test the changes in your configuration as follows:
In the portalâs search bar, search for the Traffic Manager profile name and select the Traffic Manager profile in the results that the displayed.
TheTraffic Manager profileoverview displays the DNS name of your newly created Traffic Manager profile. This can be used by any clients (for example, by navigating to it using a web browser) to get routed to the right endpoint as determined by the routing type. In this case all requests are routed to the endpoint with the lowest latency from the client's network.
Once your Traffic Manager profile is working, edit the DNS record on your authoritative DNS server to point your company domain name to the Traffic Manager domain name.
