This document describes the cost details (formerly known as usage details) fields found in files from usingAzure portal download,Exportsfrom Cost Management, or theCost DetailsAPI. For more information about cost details best practices, seeChoose a cost details solution.
Migration to new cost details formats
If you're using an older cost details solution and want to migrate to Exports or the Cost Details API, read the following articles.
Migrate from Enterprise Usage Details APIs
Migrate from EA to MCA APIs
Migrate from Consumption Usage Details API
Note
All Azure Enterprise Reporting APIs are retired. You shouldMigrate to Microsoft Cost Management APIsas soon as possible.
List of fields and descriptions
The following table describes the important terms used in the latest version of the cost details file. The list covers pay-as-you-go (also called Microsoft Online Services Program), Enterprise Agreement (EA), Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), and Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) accounts.
MPA accounts have all MCA terms, in addition to the MPA terms, as described in the following table. To identify what account type you are, seesupported Microsoft Azure offers.

Â¹ Fields used to build a unique ID for a single cost record. Every record in your cost details file should be considered unique.
Â² For MCA customers, prices are shown in the pricing currency in the Actual Cost and Amortized Cost reports. In contrast, for EA customers, the billing and pricing currencies are the same with exception ofPricingModelcolumn with valueSpotwhere the pricing currency is USD irrespective of the billing currency. For more details on Spot pricing, seeAzure Spot VM FAQ.

Â³ For more information about pricing terms and definitions, seePricing behavior in cost details.
The cost details file itself doesnât uniquely identify individual records with an ID. Instead, you can use fields in the file flagged with Â¹ to create a unique ID yourself.
Some fields might differ in casing and spacing between account types. Older versions of pay-as-you-go cost details files have separate sections for the statement and daily cost.
Part numbers in the EA invoice are also in the cost and usage file
Records in cost and usage file and other cost management experiences, such as cost analysis, include part numbers matching them with the part numbers in the EA invoice. The part numbers in the cost and usage file are shown only for EA customers.
Part numbers are shown for all usage records.
Part numbers are shown for all purchase and refund records.
Part numbers are the same in the invoice and cost and usage file details for all charge types, excluding Azure Savings Plan and prepurchase reservations. They currently don't have a part number in the cost and usage details file.
Reconcile charges in the cost and usage details file
Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) customers can use the following information to reconcile charges between billing and pricing currencies.

Reconcile reservation purchases with usage records
Every reservation purchase and usage record has two associated IDs:ReservationIdandProductOrderId.
ReservationId
ProductOrderId
Reservation purchase records (PricingModel=Reservation,ChargeType=Purchase):The records carry the purchase order ID asProductOrderId.Additionally, they stamp the same purchase order ID asReservationId.

The records carry the purchase order ID asProductOrderId.

Additionally, they stamp the same purchase order ID asReservationId.

Reservation usage records (PricingModel=Reservation,ChargeType=Usage/UnusedReservation):Like purchase records, the usage records also carry the purchase order ID asProductOrderId.However, theReservationIdcan differ, as it gets attributed to the resources that benefited from the reservation.Keep in mind that actions such as split, merge, partial refund, or exchange can create new reservations.

Keep in mind that actions such as split, merge, partial refund, or exchange can create new reservations.
Although theReservationIditself might differ, it's still part of the same order. Therefore, theProductOrderIdcan be effectively used to associate the purchase with the usage record, facilitating reconciliation between reservation purchases and usage.

Identify EA charges for included quantity
Included quantity (IQ) refers to the amount of a metered resource that can be consumed without incurring any extra cost in an Enterprise Agreement. When dealing with IQ, consider the following points:
Meter characteristics - Meters associated with IQ exhibit specific traits in the cost file because the meters allow consumption without any extra charges. In the cost file, a meter with IQ has:
ChargeType: Usage,PricingModel: OnDemand.
Unit price,effective price, andCostset to 0, because you don't get billed for their consumption.
Quantityisn't zero. It shows the actual consumption of the meter.
However, thePayG (pay-as-you-go) pricestill shows the retail price, which is nonzero.
Rounding adjustment details
A rounding adjustment represents the quantization that occurs during cost calculation. When the calculated costs are converted to the invoiced total, small rounding errors can occur. The rounding errors are represented asrounding adjustmentto ensure that the costs shown in Cost Management align to the invoice.
rounding adjustment
Why do we have rounding adjustment?
Every financial system involves rounding logic, which can cause some variance. Invoices aggregate monthly costs at the meter level, with costs rounded depending on the currency. In contrast, the cost file contains costs at the resource instance level with higher precision. This difference results in a variance in the total cost between the invoice and the cost file. The rounding adjustment is provided in the cost file at an aggregated level whenever the invoice is ready, ensuring that the total costs in both files match.
Note: Two separate rounding adjustments are providedâone for first-party records and the other for marketplace records. These adjustments aren't available during an open month and become visible when the month closes and the invoice is generated.
Customers can spread the rounding adjustment over finer details like individual resources, resource groups, or entire subscriptions. You can use a weighted average or use similar techniques.
Rounding adjustment record in the cost file
The rounding adjustment record is available in the cost file at the Billing Profile scope for Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) or at the Enrollment scope for Enterprise Agreement (EA). Since itâs an aggregated value at the invoice level, thereâs no lower-scope-level information for the record. The following fields are valid for a rounding adjustment record:
BillingAccountId
BillingAccountId
BillingAccountName

BillingPeriodStartDate

Illustration of rounding adjustment
Suppose you have two resources in your subscription: A and B. Resource A costs $0.1234 per hour and resource B costs $0.5678 per hour. You use both resources for 10 hours in a day, so the total cost for each resource is:
Resource A: $0.1234 x 10 = $1.234
Resource B: $0.5678 x 10 = $5.678
The total cost for the day is $1.234 + $5.678 = $6.912.
However, when the invoice is generated, the costs are rounded to two decimal places, so the invoice shows:
Resource A: $1.23
Resource B: $5.68
Total: $6.91
The difference between the invoice total and the actual total is $0.002, which is the rounding adjustment. To ensure Cost Management costs match the invoice, an amount of -$0.002 is shown in the cost file as the rounding adjustment after the invoice generation.
