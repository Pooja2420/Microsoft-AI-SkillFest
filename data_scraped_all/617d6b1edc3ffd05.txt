Configure VPN gateway transit for virtual network peering

This article helps you configure gateway transit for virtual network peering.Virtual network peeringseamlessly connects two Azure virtual networks, merging the two virtual networks into one for connectivity purposes.Gateway transitis a peering property that lets one virtual network use the VPN gateway in the peered virtual network for cross-premises or VNet-to-VNet connectivity.
The following diagram shows how gateway transit works with virtual network peering. In the diagram, gateway transit allows the peered virtual networks to use the Azure VPN gateway in Hub-RM. Connectivity available on the VPN gateway, including S2S, P2S, and VNet-to-VNet connections, applies to all three virtual networks.

The transit option can be used with all VPN Gateway SKUs except the Basic SKU.
In hub-and-spoke network architecture, gateway transit allows spoke virtual networks to share the VPN gateway in the hub, instead of deploying VPN gateways in every spoke virtual network. Routes to the gateway-connected virtual networks or on-premises networks propagate to the routing tables for the peered virtual networks using gateway transit.
You can disable the automatic route propagation from the VPN gateway. Create a routing table with the "Disable BGP route propagation" option, and associate the routing table to the subnets to prevent the route distribution to those subnets. For more information, seeVirtual network routing table.
Note
If you make a change to the topology of your network and have Windows VPN clients, the VPN client package for Windows clients must be downloaded and installed again in order for the changes to be applied to the client.
Prerequisites
This article requires the following VNets and permissions.
Virtual networks
Permissions
The accounts you use to create a virtual network peering must have the necessary roles or permissions. In the example below, if you were peering the two virtual networks namedHub-RMandSpoke-Classic, your account must have the following roles or permissions for each virtual network:
Learn more aboutbuilt-in rolesand assigning specific permissions tocustom roles(Resource Manager only).
To add a peering and enable transit
In theAzure portal, create or update the virtual network peering from the Hub-RM. Go to theHub-RMvirtual network. SelectPeerings, then+ Addto openAdd peering.

To modify an existing peering for transit
If you have an already existing peering, you can modify the peering for transit.
Go to the virtual network. SelectPeeringsand select the peering that you want to modify. For example, on the Spoke-RM VNet, select the SpokeRMtoHubRM peering.

PowerShell sample
You can also use PowerShell to create or update the peering. Replace the variables with the names of your virtual networks and resource groups.
$SpokeRG = "SpokeRG1"
$SpokeRM = "Spoke-RM"
$HubRG   = "HubRG1"
$HubRM   = "Hub-RM"

$spokermvnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $SpokeRM -ResourceGroup $SpokeRG
$hubrmvnet   = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $HubRM -ResourceGroup $HubRG
