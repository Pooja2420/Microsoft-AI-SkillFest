You can use the Azure portal to configure thehosting of multiple web siteswhen you create anapplication gateway. In this tutorial, you define backend address pools using virtual machines. You then configure listeners and rules based on two domains to make sure web traffic arrives at the appropriate servers in the pools. This tutorial uses examples ofwww.contoso.comandwww.fabrikam.com.
www.contoso.com
www.fabrikam.com
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create an application gateway
Create virtual machines for backend servers
Create backend pools with the backend servers
Create listeners
Create routing rules
Edit hosts file for name resolution

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Prerequisites

Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create an application gateway

For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network at the same time that you create the application gateway. Application gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.UnderConfigure virtual network, selectCreate newto create a new virtual network. In theCreate virtual networkwindow that opens, enter the following values to create the virtual network and two subnets:Name: EntermyVNetfor the name of the virtual network.Subnet name(application gateway subnet): TheSubnetsgrid will show a subnet namedDefault. Change the name of this subnet tomyAGSubnet.The application gateway subnet can contain only application gateways. No other resources are allowed. The default IP address range provided is 10.0.0.0/24.SelectOKto close theCreate virtual networkwindow and save the virtual network settings.

The backend pool is used to route requests to the backend servers that serve the request. Backend pools can be NICs, virtual machine scale sets, public IPs, internal IPs, fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and multi-tenant backends like Azure App Service. In this example, you'll create an empty backend pool with your application gateway and then add backend targets to the backend pool.
On theBackendstab, selectAdd a backend pool.
On theBackendstab, selectAdd a backend pool.

Review the settings on theReview + createtab, and then selectCreateto create the virtual network, the public IP address, and the application gateway. It may take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway.
Wait until the deployment finishes successfully before moving on to the next section.
Add backend targets
In this example, you'll use virtual machines as the target backend. You can either use existing virtual machines or create new ones. You'll create two virtual machines that Azure uses as backend servers for the application gateway.
To add backend targets, you'll:
Add a backend subnet.
Create two new VMs,contosoVMandfabrikamVM, to be used as backend servers.
Install IIS on the virtual machines to verify that the application gateway was created successfully.
Add the backend servers to the backend pools.
Add a backend subnet
On the Azure portal, search forvirtual networksand select *myVNet.
UnderSettings, selectSubnets.
Select+ Subnetand in theAdd subnetpane, entermyBackendSubnetforNameand accept10.0.1.0/24as theSubnet address range.

Install IIS for testing
In this example, you install IIS on the virtual machines only to verify Azure created the application gateway successfully.
OpenAzure PowerShell. To do so, selectCloud Shellfrom the top navigation bar of the Azure portal and then selectPowerShellfrom the drop-down list.

Edit your hosts file for name resolution
After the application gateway is created with its public IP address, you can get the IP address, and use it to edit your hosts file to resolvewww.contoso.comandwww.fabrikam.com. In a production environment, you could create aCNAMEin DNS for name resolution.

To remove the resource group:
On the left menu of the Azure portal, selectResource groups.
On theResource groupspage, search formyResourceGroupAGin the list, then select it.
On themyResourceGroupAGpage, selectDelete resource group.
EntermyResourceGroupAGforTYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAMEand then selectDelete.
