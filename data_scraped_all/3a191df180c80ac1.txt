It provides a single go-to location for enabling and managing these capabilities.

Microsoft Defender for SQL provides a set of advanced SQL security capabilities, including SQL Vulnerability Assessment and Advanced Threat Protection.
Vulnerability Assessmentis an easy-to-configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. It provides visibility into your security state, and it includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database fortifications.
Advanced Threat Protectiondetects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your database. It continuously monitors your database for suspicious activities, and it provides immediate security alerts on potential vulnerabilities, Azure SQL injection attacks, and anomalous database access patterns.
