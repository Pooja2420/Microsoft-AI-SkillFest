Add a peer
In this section, you learn how to add a BGP peering to your route server to peer with a network virtual appliance (NVA).
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Go to the route server that you want to peer with an NVA.
Go to the route server that you want to peer with an NVA.
underSettings, selectPeers.
underSettings, selectPeers.
Select+ Addto add a new peer.
Select+ Addto add a new peer.
On theAdd Peerpage, enter the following information:SettingValueNameA name to identify the peer. It doesn't have to be the same name of the NVA.ASNThe Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the NVA. For more information, seeWhat Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) can I use?IPv4 AddressThe private IP address of the NVA.
On theAdd Peerpage, enter the following information:
SelectAddto save the configuration.Once the peer NVA is successfully added, you can see it in the list of peers with aSucceededprovisioning state.To complete the peering setup, you must configure the NVA to establish a BGP session with the route server using its IP addresses and ASN. You can find the route server's IP addresses and ASN in theOverviewpage:ImportantPeer the NVA with both route server instance IPs to ensure virtual network routes are advertised over the NVA connections and achieve high availability.
SelectAddto save the configuration.

Once the peer NVA is successfully added, you can see it in the list of peers with aSucceededprovisioning state.

To complete the peering setup, you must configure the NVA to establish a BGP session with the route server using its IP addresses and ASN. You can find the route server's IP addresses and ASN in theOverviewpage:

Important
Peer the NVA with both route server instance IPs to ensure virtual network routes are advertised over the NVA connections and achieve high availability.
UseAdd-AzRouteServerPeercmdlet to add a new peer to the route server.
Add-AzRouteServerPeer -PeerName 'myNVA' -PeerAsn '65001' -PeerIp '10.0.0.4' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer'
Add-AzRouteServerPeer -PeerName 'myNVA' -PeerAsn '65001' -PeerIp '10.0.0.4' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer'
-PeerName
-PeerAsn
-PeerIp
-ResourceGroupName
-RouteServerName
After you successfully add the peer NVA, you must configure the NVA to establish a BGP session with the route server's peer IPs and ASN. UseGet-AzRouteServercmdlet to find the route server's peer IPs and ASN:
Get-AzRouteServer -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer'
Get-AzRouteServer -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer'
-ResourceGroupName
-RouteServerName
Important
Peer the NVA with both route server instance IPs to ensure virtual network routes are advertised over the NVA connections and achieve high availability.
Useaz network routeserver peering createcommand to add a new peer to the route server.
az network routeserver peering create --name 'myNVA' --peer-asn '65001' --peer-ip '10.0.0.4' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --routeserver 'myRouteServer'
az network routeserver peering create --name 'myNVA' --peer-asn '65001' --peer-ip '10.0.0.4' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --routeserver 'myRouteServer'
--name
--peer-asn
--peer-ip
--resource-group
--routeserver
After you successfully add the peer NVA, you must configure the NVA to establish a BGP session with the route server's peer IPs and ASN. Useaz network routeserver showcommand to find the route server's peer IPs and ASN:
az network routeserver show --name 'myRouteServer' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup'
az network routeserver show --name 'myRouteServer' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup'
--name
--resource-group
Important
Peer the NVA with both route server instance IPs to ensure virtual network routes are advertised over the NVA connections and achieve high availability.
Configure route exchange
In this section, you learn how to enable exchanging routes between your route server and the virtual network gateway (ExpressRoute or VPN) that exists in the same virtual network.
Important
The Azure VPN gateway must be configured inactive-activemode and have the ASN set to65515. It's not a requirement to have BGP enabled on the VPN gateway to communicate with the route server.
Warning
When you create or delete a route server in a virtual network that contains a virtual network gateway (ExpressRoute or VPN), expect downtime until the operation is complete. If you have an ExpressRoute circuit connected to the virtual network where you're creating or deleting the route server, the downtime doesn't affect the ExpressRoute circuit or its connections to other virtual networks.
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Go to the route server that you want to configure.
Go to the route server that you want to configure.
UnderSettings, selectConfiguration.

SelectEnabledfor theBranch-to-branchsetting and then selectSave.

UseUpdate-AzRouteServercmdlet to enable or disable route exchange between the route server and the virtual network gateway.
Update-AzRouteServer -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -AllowBranchToBranchTraffic 1
Update-AzRouteServer -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -AllowBranchToBranchTraffic 1

0
To disable route exchange, set the-AllowBranchToBranchTrafficparameter to0.
-AllowBranchToBranchTraffic
0
UseGet-AzRouteServercmdlet to verify the configuration.
Useaz network routeserver updatecommand to enable or disable route exchange between the route server and the virtual network gateway.
az network routeserver peering show --name 'myRouteServer' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --allow-b2b-traffic true
az network routeserver peering show --name 'myRouteServer' --resource-group 'myResourceGroup' --allow-b2b-traffic true

false
To disable route exchange, set the--allow-b2b-trafficparameter tofalse.
--allow-b2b-traffic
false
Useaz network routeserver showcommand to verify the configuration.
