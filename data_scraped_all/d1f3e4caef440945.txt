The Ev3 and Esv3-series run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell) processor in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general purpose workloads, and bringing the Ev3 into alignment with the general purpose VMs of most other clouds.  Memory has been expanded (from 7 GiB/vCPU to 8 GiB/vCPU) while disk and network limits have been adjusted on a per core basis to align with the move to hyperthreading. The Ev3 is the follow up to the high memory VM sizes of the D/Dv2 families.
Ev3-series
Ev3-series instances run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell) processors, and feature Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. Ev3-series instances are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications.
Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium storage disks, use the ESv3 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for ESv3 sizes are the same as Ev3-series.

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toReadOnlyorReadWrite.  For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toNone.

Expected network bandwidthis the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth.Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines. To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
