The Container insights integrated agent automatically collects metrics for deployments and horizontal pod autoscalers (HPAs).
Deployment metrics
Container insights automatically starts monitoring deployments by collecting the following metrics at 60-second intervals and storing them in theInsightMetricstable.
deployment - name of the deployment
k8sNamespace - Kubernetes namespace for the deployment
deploymentStrategy - Deployment strategy to use to replace pods with new ones (spec.strategy.type)
creationTime - deployment creation timestamp
spec_replicas - Number of desired pods (spec.replicas)
status_replicas_available - Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this deployment (status.availableReplicas)
status_replicas_updated - Total number of non-terminated pods targeted by this deployment that have the desired template spec (status.updatedReplicas)
HPA metrics
Container insights automatically starts monitoring HPAs by collecting the following metrics at 60-second intervals and storing them in theInsightMetricstable.
hpa - name of the HPA
k8sNamespace - Kubernetes namespace for the HPA
lastScaleTime - Last time the HPA scaled the number of pods (status.lastScaleTime)
creationTime - HPA creation timestamp
spec_max_replicas - Upper limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler (spec.maxReplicas)
spec_min_replicas - Lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down (spec.minReplicas)
status_desired_replicas - Desired number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler (status.desiredReplicas)
targetKind - Kind of the HPA's target (spec.scaleTargetRef.kind)
targetName - Name of the HPA's target (spec.scaleTargetRef.name)
Deployment and HPA charts
Container insights includes preconfigured charts for the metrics listed earlier in the table as a workbook for every cluster. You can find the deployments and HPA workbookDeployments & HPAdirectly from an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. On the left pane, selectWorkbooksand selectView Workbooksfrom the dropdown list in the insight.
