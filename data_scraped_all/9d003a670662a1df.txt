In this quickstart, you'll learn how set up the prerequisites for securely using Azure AI services in Azure Synapse Analytics. Linking these Azure AI services allows you to leverage Azure AI services from various experiences in Synapse.
This quickstart covers:
Create an Azure AI services resource like Text Analytics or Anomaly Detector.
Store an authentication key to Azure AI services resources as secrets in Azure Key Vault, and configure access for an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
Create an Azure Key Vault linked service in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
Create an Azure AI services linked service in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
If you don't have an Azure subscription,create a free account before you begin.
Prerequisites
Azure Synapse Analytics workspacewith an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account configured as the default storage. You need to be theStorage Blob Data Contributorof the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 file system that you work with.
Sign in to the Azure portal
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create an Azure AI services resource
Azure AI servicesincludes many types of services. Follow services are examples used in the Azure Synapse tutorials.
You can create aText Analyticsresource in the Azure portal:

You can create anAnomaly Detectorresource in the Azure portal:

You can create anAzure AI Document Intelligenceresource (for Document Intelligence) in the Azure portal:

You can create aTranslatorresource in the Azure portal:

You can create aComputer Visionresource in the Azure portal:

You can create aFaceresource in the Azure portal:

You can create aSpeechresource in the Azure portal:

Create a key vault and configure secrets and access

Go toKey Vault>Secretto create a new secret. Specify the name of the secret, and then paste the key from the previous step into theValuefield. Finally, selectCreate.ImportantMake sure you remember or note down this secret name. You'll use it later when you create the Azure AI services linked service.

Important
Make sure you remember or note down this secret name. You'll use it later when you create the Azure AI services linked service.
Create an Azure Key Vault linked service in Azure Synapse
Open your workspace in Synapse Studio.
Go toManage>Linked Services. Create anAzure Key Vaultlinked service by pointing to the key vault that you just created.
Verify the connection by selecting theTest connectionbutton. If the connection is green, selectCreateand then selectPublish allto save your change.
