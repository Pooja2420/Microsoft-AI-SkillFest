In this article, you learn how to diagnose routing problems by viewing the effective routes for a network interface in a virtual machine (VM). Azure automatically creates default routes for each virtual network subnet. You can override these default routes by defining custom routes in a route table and associating the table with a subnet. The effective routes for a network interface are a combination of Azure's default routes, custom routes you define, and any routes propagated from your on-premises network through an Azure VPN gateway using the border gateway protocol (BGP). If you're new to virtual networks, network interfaces, or routing, seeVirtual network overview,Network interface, andRouting overview.
Scenario
You attempt to connect to a VM, but the connection fails. To determine why you can't connect to the VM, you can view the effective routes for a network interface using the Azureportal,PowerShell, or theAzure CLI.
The steps that follow assume you have an existing VM to view the effective routes for. If you don't have an existing VM, first deploy aLinuxorWindowsVM to complete the tasks in this article with. The examples in this article are for a VM namedvm-1with a network interface namedvm-1445. The VM and network interface are in a resource group namedtest-rg, and are in theEast USregion. Change the values in the steps, as appropriate, for the VM you're diagnosing the problem for.
Diagnose using Azure portal

At the top of the Azure portal, enter the name of a VM that is in the running state, in the search box. When the name of the VM appears in the search results, select it.

In the network interface, expandHelp. SelectEffective routes.Select the desired network interface to view its effective routes. Each interface might belong to a different subnet, resulting in unique routes.
The example in the image shows default routes created by Azure for each subnet. Your list includes the default routes and might also include extra routes. The routes could be from features like virtual network peering or connections to on-premises networks via an Azure VPN gateway. For details about the routes, seeVirtual network traffic routing. If there are many routes, use theDownloadoption to save them as a .csv file for easier review.

Diagnose using PowerShell
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
You can run the commands that follow in theAzure Cloud Shell, or by running PowerShell from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. If you run PowerShell from your computer, you need the Azure PowerShell module, version 1.0.0 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Azon your computer, to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module. If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to runConnect-AzAccountto log into Azure with an account that has thenecessary permissions.
Get-Module -ListAvailable Az
Connect-AzAccount
Get the effective routes for a network interface withGet-AzEffectiveRouteTable. The following example gets the effective routes for a network interface namedvm-1445in a resource group namedtest-rg:
$Params = @{
  NetworkInterfaceName = "vm-1445"
  ResourceGroupName    = "test-rg"
}
Get-AzEffectiveRouteTable @Params | Format-Table
$Params = @{
  NetworkInterfaceName = "vm-1445"
  ResourceGroupName    = "test-rg"
}
Get-AzEffectiveRouteTable @Params | Format-Table
To understand the information returned in the output, seeRouting overview. Output is only returned if the VM is in the running state. If there are multiple network interfaces attached to the VM, you can review the effective routes for each network interface. Since each network interface can be in a different subnet, each network interface can have different effective routes. If you're still having a communication problem, seemore diagnosesandconsiderations.
If you know the VM name but not the network interface name, use the following commands to return the ID of all network interfaces attached to the VM:
$Params = @{
  Name              = "vm-1"
  ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$VM = Get-AzVM @Params
$VM.NetworkProfile
$Params = @{
  Name              = "vm-1"
  ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$VM = Get-AzVM @Params
$VM.NetworkProfile
You receive output similar to the following example:
NetworkInterfaces
-----------------
{/subscriptions/<ID>/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/vm-1445
NetworkInterfaces
-----------------
{/subscriptions/<ID>/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/vm-1445
In the previous output, the network interface name isvm-1445.
Diagnose using Azure CLI
You can run the commands that follow in theAzure Cloud Shell, or by running the CLI from your computer. This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.32 or later. Runaz --versionto find the installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure CLI. If you're running the Azure CLI locally, you also need to runaz loginand log into Azure with an account that has thenecessary permissions.
az --version
az login
Get the effective routes for a network interface withaz network nic show-effective-route-table. The following command gets the effective routes for a network interface namedvm-1445that is in a resource group namedtest-rg:
az network nic show-effective-route-table \
  --name vm-1445 \
  --resource-group test-rg
az network nic show-effective-route-table \
  --name vm-1445 \
  --resource-group test-rg

If there are multiple network interfaces attached to the VM, you can review the effective routes for each network interface. Since each network interface can be in a different subnet, each network interface can have different effective routes.

If you know the VM name but not the network interface name, use the following commands to return the ID of all network interfaces attached to the VM:
az vm show \
  --name vm-1 \
  --resource-group test-rg
az vm show \
  --name vm-1 \
  --resource-group test-rg

Considerations
Consider the following points when troubleshooting communication problems:
Routing uses the longest prefix match (LPM) to determine the best route from system routes, BGP, and custom routes. If multiple routes share the same LPM match, Azure selects one based on the priority order inRouting overview. Effective routes show only the LPM-matched routes, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot routes affecting VM communication.

Effective routes show only the LPM-matched routes, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot routes affecting VM communication.
If custom routes direct traffic to a network virtual appliance (NVA) withVirtual Applianceas the next hop type, ensure the NVA's IP forwarding is enabled; otherwise, packets are dropped. Learn how toenable IP forwarding for a network interfaceand configure the NVA's operating system or application to forward traffic.

Learn how toenable IP forwarding for a network interfaceand configure the NVA's operating system or application to forward traffic.
If a route to 0.0.0.0/0 is created, all outbound internet traffic is routed to the next hop you specified, such as to an NVA or VPN gateway. Creating such a route is often referred to as forced tunneling. Remote connections using the RDP or SSH protocols from the internet to your VM might not work with this route, depending on how the next hop handles the traffic. Forced-tunneling can be enabled:When using site-to-site VPN, by creating a route with a next hop type ofVPN Gateway.

For virtual network peering traffic to work correctly, a system route with a next hop type ofVNet Peeringmust exist for the peered virtual network's prefix range. If such a route doesn't exist, and the virtual network peering link isConnected:Wait a few seconds, and retry. If it's a newly established peering link, it occasionally takes longer to propagate routes to all the network interfaces in a subnet. To learn more about virtual network peering, seeVirtual network peering overviewandmanage virtual network peering.Network security group rules might be impacting communication.

Though Azure assigns default routes to each Azure network interface, if you have multiple network interfaces attached to the VM, only the primary network interface is assigned a default route (0.0.0.0/0), or gateway, within the VM's operating system.

If you'reforce tunnelingtraffic to an on-premises device through a VPN gateway, or NVA, you might not be able to connect to a VM from the internet, depending on how routing is configured for the devices. Confirm that the routing configured for the device routes traffic to either a public or private IP address for the VM.
