This article describes a high-level DevOps workflow for deploying application changes to staging and production environments in Azure. The solution uses continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices with Azure Pipelines.
Important
This article covers a general CI/CD architecture using Azure Pipelines. It isn't intended to cover the specifics of deploying to different environments, such as Azure App Services, Virtual Machines, and Azure Power Platform. Deployment platform specifics are covered in separate articles.
Architecture

Architecture diagram of an Azure pipeline. The diagram shows the following steps: 1. An engineer pushing code changes to an Azure DevOps Git repository. 2. An Azure Pipelines PR pipeline getting triggered. This pipeline shows the following tasks: linting, restore, build, and unit tests. 3. An Azure Pipelines CI pipeline getting triggered. This pipeline shows the following tasks: get secrets, linting, restore, build, unit tests, integration tests, and publishing build artifacts. 3. An Azure Pipelines CD pipeline getting triggered. This pipeline shows the following tasks: download artifacts, deploy to staging, tests, manual intervention, and release. 4. Shows the CD pipeline deploying to a staging environment. 5. Shows the CD pipeline releasing to a production environment. 6. Shows an operator monitoring the pipeline, taking advantage of Azure Monitor, Azure Application Insights, and Azure Analytics Workspace.

Note
Although this article covers CI/CD for application changes, Azure Pipelines can also be used to build CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure as code (IaC) changes.
Dataflow
The data flows through the scenario as follows:
PR pipeline- A pull request (PR) to Azure Repos Git triggers a PR pipeline. This pipeline runs fast quality checks. These checks should include:Building the code, which requires pulling dependencies from a dependency management system.The use of tools to analyze the code, such as static code analysis, linting, and security scanningUnit testsIf any of the checks fail, the pipeline run ends and the developer will have to make the required changes. If all checks pass, the pipeline should require a PR review. If the PR review fails, the pipeline ends and the developer will have to make the required changes. If all the checks and PR reviews pass, the PR will successfully merge.

Unit tests
If any of the checks fail, the pipeline run ends and the developer will have to make the required changes. If all checks pass, the pipeline should require a PR review. If the PR review fails, the pipeline ends and the developer will have to make the required changes. If all the checks and PR reviews pass, the PR will successfully merge.
CI pipeline- A merge to Azure Repos Git triggers a CI pipeline. This pipeline runs the same checks as the PR pipeline with some important additions. The CI pipeline runs integration tests. Integration tests can be resource-intensive, so running them in the CI pipeline balances development speed and bug detection. It's also important to note that passing tests in a PR does not always ensure they will succeed after merging, as changes in the main branch can introduce new issues, highlighting the need for post-merge testing. These factors make the CI pipeline a better place for integration tests than the PR pipeline.
These integration tests shouldn't require the deployment of the solution, as the build artifacts haven't been created yet. If the integration tests require secrets, the pipeline gets those secrets from Azure Key Vault. If any of the checks fail, the pipeline ends and the developer will have to make the required changes. The result of a successful run of this pipeline is the creation and publishing of build artifacts.

CD release to staging- The CD pipeline downloads the build artifacts that are created in the CI pipeline and deploys the solution to a staging environment. The pipeline then runs acceptance tests against the staging environment to validate the deployment. If any acceptance test fails, the pipeline ends and the developer will have to make the required changes. If the tests succeed, amanual validation taskcan be implemented to require a person or group to validate the deployment and resume the pipeline.

CD release to production- If the manual intervention is resumed, or there's no manual intervention implemented, the pipeline releases the solution to production. The pipeline should run smoke tests in production to ensure the release is working as expected. If a manual intervention step results in a cancel, the release fails, or the smoke tests fail, the release is rolled back, the pipeline ends, and the developer will have to make the required changes.

Monitoring- Azure Monitor collects observability data such as logs and metrics so that an operator can analyze health, performance, and usage data. Application Insights collects all application-specific monitoring data, such as traces. Azure Log Analytics is used to store all that data.

Azure Pipelinesprovides a way to build, test, package, and release application and infrastructure code. This example has three distinct pipelines with the following responsibilities:PR pipelines validate code before allowing a PR to merge through linting, building, and unit testing.CI pipelines run after code is merged. They perform the same validation as PR pipelines, but add integration testing and publish build artifacts if everything succeeds.CD pipelines deploy build artifacts, run acceptance tests, and release to production.

Azure Artifact Feedsallow you to manage and share software packages, such as Maven, npm, and NuGet. Artifact feeds allow you to manage the lifecycle of your packages, including versioning, promoting, and retiring packages. This helps you to ensure that your team is using the latest and most secure versions of your packages.

Key Vaultprovides a way to manage secure data for your solution, including secrets, encryption keys, and certificates. In this architecture, it's used to store application secrets. These secrets are accessed through the pipeline. Secrets can be accessed by Azure Pipelines with aKey Vault taskor bylinking secrets from Key Vault.

Scenario details
Using proven CI and CD practices to deploy application or infrastructure changes provides various benefits including:
Shorter release cycles- Automated CI/CD processes allow you to deploy faster than manual practices. Many organizations deploy multiple times per day.
Better code quality- Quality gates in CI pipelines, such as linting and unit testing, result in higher quality code.
Decreased risk of releasing- Proper CI/CD practices dramatically decreases the risk of releasing new features. The deployment can be tested prior to release.
Increased productivity- Automated CI/CD frees developers from working on manual integrations and deployments so they can focus on new features.
Enable rollbacks- While proper CI/CD practices lower the number of bugs or regressions that are released, they still occur. CI/CD can enable automated rollbacks to earlier releases.
Potential use cases
Consider Azure Pipelines and CI/CD processes for:
Accelerating application development and deployment lifecycles.
Building quality and consistency into an automated build and release process.
Increasing application stability and uptime.

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

Consider usingSelf-hosted agentsif you're deploying to resources running in a secured virtual network. You might also consider self-hosted agents if you're running a high volume of builds. In cases of high build volumes, self-hosted agents can be used to speed up builds in a cost efficient manner.

Consider usingApplication Insightsand other monitoring tools as early as possible in your release pipeline. Many organizations only begin monitoring in their production environment. By monitoring your other environments, you can identify bugs earlier in the development process and avoid issues in your production environment.

Cost optimization
Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeOverview of the cost optimization pillar.
Azure DevOps costs depend on the number of users in your organization that require access, along with other factors like the number of concurrent build/releases required and number of test users. For more information, seeAzure DevOps pricing.
Thispricing calculatorprovides an estimate for running Azure DevOps with 20 users.
Azure DevOps is billed on a per-user per-month basis. There might be more charges depending on concurrent pipelines needed, in addition to any more test users or user basic licenses.
