Managed identities for Azure resources are service principals that create a Microsoft Entra identity and specific permissions for Azure managed resources. Managed identities are a safer way to grant access to storage data and replace the requirement for you to include shared access signature tokens (SAS) with your source and target container URLs.

You can use managed identities to grant access to any resource that supports Microsoft Entra authentication, including your own applications.

To use managed identities for Language operations, you mustcreate your Language resourcein a specific geographic Azure region such asEast US. If your Language resource region is set toGlobal, then you can't use managed identity authentication. You can, however, still useShared Access Signature (SAS) tokens.

Managed identity assignments
There are two types of managed identities:system-assignedanduser-assigned. Currently, Document Translation supportssystem-assigned managed identity:
A system-assigned managed identity isenableddirectly on a service instance. It isn't enabled by default; you must go to your resource and update the identity setting.

The system-assigned managed identity is tied to your resource throughout its lifecycle. If you delete your resource, the managed identity is deleted as well.

In the following steps, we enable a system-assigned managed identity and grant your Language resource limited access to your Azure Blob Storage account.
Enable a system-assigned managed identity
You must grant the Language resource access to your storage account before it can create, read, or delete blobs. Once you enabled the Language resource with a system-assigned managed identity, you can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), to give Language features access to your Azure storage containers.
