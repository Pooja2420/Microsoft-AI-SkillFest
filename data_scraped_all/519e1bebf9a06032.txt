Today, companies struggle to control and govern increasingly complex environments that extend across data centers, multiple clouds, and edge. Each environment and cloud possesses its own set of management tools, and new DevOps and ITOps operational models can be hard to implement across resources.
Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multicloud and on-premises management platform.
Azure Arc provides a centralized, unified way to:
Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure and/or on-premises resources into Azure Resource Manager.
Manage virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.
Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where your resources live.
Continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud native patterns in your environment.
Configure custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions.

Currently, Azure Arc allows you to manage the following resource types hosted outside of Azure:
Serversand virtual machines: Manage Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure. Provision, resize, delete, and manage virtual machines based onAzure Localand onVMware vCenterorSystem Center Virtual Machine Managermanaged on-premises environments.
Kubernetes clusters: Attach and configure Kubernetes clusters running anywhere, with multiple supported distributions.
Azure data services: Run Azure data services on-premises, at the edge, and in public clouds using Kubernetes and the infrastructure of your choice. SQL Managed Instance
and PostgreSQL (preview) services are currently available.
SQL Server: Extend Azure services to SQL Server instances hosted outside of Azure.

Pricing
Below is pricing information for the features available today with Azure Arc.
Azure Arc-enabled servers
The following Azure Arc control plane functionality is offered at no extra cost:
Resource organization through Azure management groups and tags
Searching and indexing through Azure Resource Graph
Access and security through Azure Role-based access control (RBAC)
Environments and automation through templates and extensions
Any Azure service that is used on Azure Arc-enabled servers, such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud or Azure Monitor, will be charged as per the pricing for that service. For more information, see theAzure pricing page.
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere and System Center Virtual Machine Manager
The following Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere and System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) capabilities are offered at no extra cost:
All the Azure Arc control plane functionalities that are offered at no extra cost with Azure Arc-enabled servers.
Discovery and single pane of glass inventory view of your VMware vCenter and SCVMM managed estate (VMs, templates, networks, datastores, clouds/clusters/hosts/resource pools).
Lifecycle (create, resize, update, and delete) and power cycle (start, stop, and restart) operations of VMs, including the ability to delegate self-service access for these operations using Azure role-based access control (RBAC).
Management of VMs using Azure portal, CLI, REST APIs, SDKs, and automation through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates such as ARM, Terraform, and Bicep.
