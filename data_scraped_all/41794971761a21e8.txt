Organizations who deploy Microsoft Intune can use the information returned from their devices to identify devices that meet compliance requirements such as:
Requiring a PIN to unlock
Requiring device encryption
Requiring a minimum or maximum operating system version
Requiring a device isn't jailbroken or rooted
Policy compliance information is sent to Microsoft Entra ID where Conditional Access decides to grant or block access to resources. More information about device compliance policies can be found in the article,Set rules on devices to allow access to resources in your organization using Intune
Requiring a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device is dependent on your devices already being Microsoft Entra hybrid joined. For more information, see the articleConfigure Microsoft Entra hybrid join.
User exclusions
Conditional Access policies are powerful tools, we recommend excluding the following accounts from your policies:
Emergency accessorbreak-glassaccounts to prevent lockout due to policy misconfiguration. In the unlikely scenario all administrators are locked out, your emergency-access administrative account can be used to log in and take steps to recover access.More information can be found in the article,Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID.

Service accountsandService principals, such as the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Account. Service accounts are non-interactive accounts that aren't tied to any particular user. They're normally used by back-end services allowing programmatic access to applications, but are also used to sign in to systems for administrative purposes. Calls made by service principals won't be blocked by Conditional Access policies scoped to users. Use Conditional Access for workload identities to define policies targeting service principals.If your organization has these accounts in use in scripts or code, consider replacing them withmanaged identities.

Template deployment
Organizations can choose to deploy this policy using the steps outlined below or using theConditional Access templates.
Create a Conditional Access policy
The following steps help create a Conditional Access policy to require multifactor authentication, devices accessing resources be marked as compliant with your organization's Intune compliance policies, or be Microsoft Entra hybrid joined.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aConditional Access Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Conditional Access>Policies.
SelectNew policy.
Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.

Note
You can enroll your new devices to Intune even if you selectRequire device to be marked as compliantforAll usersandAll resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')using the previous steps.Require device to be marked as compliantcontrol doesn't block Intune enrollment and the access to the Microsoft Intune Web Company Portal application.
Known behavior
On iOS, Android, macOS, and some non-Microsoft web browsers, Microsoft Entra ID identifies the device using a client certificate that is provisioned when the device is registered with Microsoft Entra ID. When a user first signs in through the browser the user is prompted to select the certificate. The end user must select this certificate before they can continue to use the browser.
Organizations that use the Subscription Activation feature to enable users to "step-up" from one version of Windows to another and use Conditional Access policies to control access need to exclude one of the following cloud apps from their Conditional Access policies usingSelect Excluded Cloud Apps:
Universal Store Service APIs and Web Application, AppID 45a330b1-b1ec-4cc1-9161-9f03992aa49f.
Universal Store Service APIs and Web Application, AppID 45a330b1-b1ec-4cc1-9161-9f03992aa49f.
Windows Store for Business, AppID 45a330b1-b1ec-4cc1-9161-9f03992aa49f.
Windows Store for Business, AppID 45a330b1-b1ec-4cc1-9161-9f03992aa49f.
Although the app ID is the same in both instances, the name of the cloud app depends on the tenant.
When a device is offline for an extended period of time, the device might not reactivate automatically if this Conditional Access exclusion isn't in place. Setting this Conditional Access exclusion ensures that Subscription Activation continues to work seamlessly.
Starting with Windows 11, version 23H2 withKB5034848or later, users are prompted for authentication with a toast notification when Subscription Activation needs to reactivate. The toast notification shows the following message:
Your account requires authentication
Please sign in to your work or school account to verify your information.
Additionally, in theActivationpane, the following message might appear:
Please sign in to your work or school account to verify your information.
The prompt for authentication usually occurs when a device is offline for an extended period of time. This change eliminates the need for an exclusion in the Conditional Access policy for Windows 11, version 23H2 withKB5034848or later. A Conditional Access policy can still be used with Windows 11, version 23H2 withKB5034848or later if the prompt for user authentication via a toast notification isn't desired.
