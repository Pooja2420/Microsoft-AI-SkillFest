The hostname identifies your virtual machine (VM) in the user interface and
Azure operations. You first assign the hostname of a VM in theVirtual
machine namefield during the creation process in the Azure portal. After
you create a VM, you can view and modify the hostname either through a remote
connection or in the Azure portal.
View hostnames
You can view the hostname of your VM in a cloud service by using any of the following tools.
Azure portal
In the Azure portal, go to your VM, and on the service menu, selectProperties. On thePropertiespage, you can view the hostname underComputer Name.

Remote desktop
You can connect to your VM by using a remote desktop tool like Remote Desktop (Windows), Windows PowerShell remoting (Windows), SSH (Linux and Windows) or Bastion (Azure portal). You can then view the hostname in a few ways:
Enterhostnamein PowerShell, the command prompt, or an SSH terminal.
Enteripconfig /allin the command prompt (Windows only).
ipconfig /all
View the computer name in the system settings (Windows only).
Prerequisites
Azure API
From a REST client, follow these instructions:
Ensure that you have an authenticated connection to the Azure portal.
Follow the steps presented inCreate a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources.

Look for theosProfileand then thecomputerNameelement to find the hostname.WarningYou can also view the internal domain suffix for your cloud service by
runningipconfig /allfrom a command prompt in a remote desktop
session (Windows) or by runningcat /etc/resolv.conffrom an SSH
terminal (Linux).

Modify a hostname
You can modify the hostname for any VM by renaming the computer from a
remote desktop session or by usingRun commandin the Azure portal.
Change the hostname.From a remote session:For Windows, you can change the hostname from PowerShell by using theRename-Computercommand.For Linux, you can change the hostname by usinghostnamectl.From the Azure portal:
You can also run these commands to find the hostname for your VM
from the Azure portal by usingRun command. In the Azure portal,
go to your VM, and on the service menu, selectRun command.
On theRun commandpage in the Azure portal:For Windows, selectRunPowerShellScriptand useRename-Computerin theRun Command Scriptpane.For Linux, selectRunShellScriptand usehostnamectlin theRun Command Scriptpane.The following image shows theRun commandpage in the Azure portal for a Windows VM.

After you run eitherRename-Computerorhostnamectlon your VM, you
need to restart your VM for the hostname to change.Azure classic deployment modelThe Azure classic deployment model uses a configuration file that you
can download and upload to change the hostname. To allow your hostname
to reference your role instances, you must set the value for the host
name in the service configuration file for each role. You do that by
adding the hostname that you want to thevmNameattribute of theRoleelement. The value of thevmNameattribute is used as a base for the
hostname of each role instance.For example, ifvmNameiswebroleand there are three instances of
that role, the hostnames of the instances arewebrole0,webrole1,
andwebrole2. You don't need to specify a hostname for VMs in the configuration file because the hostname for a VM is
populated based on the VM name. For more information about
configuring an Azure service, seeAzure service configuration schema (.cscfg File).Service configuration fileIn the Azure classic deployment model, you can download the service
configuration file for a deployed service from theConfigurepane of
the service in the Azure portal. You can then look for thevmNameattribute for theRole nameelement to see the hostname. This hostname is used as a base for the hostname of each
role instance. For example, ifvmNameiswebroleand there are
three instances of that role, the hostnames of the instances arewebrole0,webrole1,
andwebrole2. For more information, seeAzure Virtual Network configuration schema.
