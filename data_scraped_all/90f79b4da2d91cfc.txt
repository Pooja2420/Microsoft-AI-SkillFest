Container Network Observability is a feature of theAdvanced Container Networking Servicessuite. It equips you with next-level monitoring and diagnostics tools, providing unparalleled visibility into your containerized workloads. These tools empower you to pinpoint and troubleshoot network issues with ease, ensuring optimal performance for your applications.
Container Network Observability is compatible with all Linux workloads seamlessly integrating with Hubble regardless of whether the underlying data plane is Cilium or non-Cilium (both are supported) ensuring flexibility for your container networking needs.

Note
For Cilium data plane scenarios, Container Network Observability is available beginning with Kubernetes version 1.29.
Container Network Observability is supported on all Linux distributions including Azure Linux beginning with version 2.0.
Features of Container Network Observability
Container Network Observability offers the following capabilities to monitor network-related issues in your cluster:
Node-Level Metrics:Understanding the health of your container network at the node-level is crucial for maintaining optimal application performance. These metrics provide insights into traffic volume, dropped packets, number of connections, etc. by node. The metrics are stored in Prometheus format and, as such, you can view them in Grafana.

Hubble Metrics (DNS and Pod-Level Metrics):These Prometheus metrics include source and destination pod information allowing you to pinpoint network-related issues at a granular level. Metrics cover traffic volume, dropped packets, TCP resets, L4/L7 packet flows, etc. There are also DNS metrics (currently only for Non-Cilium data planes), covering DNS errors and DNS requests missing responses.

Hubble Flow Logs:Flow logs provide deep visibility into your cluster's network activity. All communications to and from pods are logged allowing you to investigate connectivity issues over time. Flow logs help answer questions such as: did the server receive the client's request? What is the round-trip latency between the client's request and server's response?Hubble CLI:The Hubble Command-Line Interface (CLI) can retrieve flow logs across the entire cluster with customizable filtering and formatting.Hubble UI:Hubble UI is a user-friendly browser-based interface for exploring cluster network activity. It creates a service-connection graph based on flow logs, and displays flow logs for the selected namespace. Users are responsible for provisioning and managing the infrastructure required to run Hubble UI.

Node-Level Metrics
The following metrics are aggregated per node. All metrics include labels:

Cilium
Non-Cilium
For Cilium data plane scenarios, Container Network Observability provides metrics only for Linux, Windows is currently not supported.
Cilium exposes several metrics including the following used by Container Network Observability.

Limitations
Pod-level metrics are available only on Linux.
Cilium data plane is supported starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.
Metric labels may have subtle differences between Cilium and non-Cilium clusters.
For Cilium based clusters, DNS metrics are only available for pods that have Cilium Network policies (CNP) configured on their clusters.
Flow logs are not currently available in the air gapped cloud.
Hubble relay may crash if one of the hubble node agents goes down and may cause interruptions to Hubble CLI.
Scale
Azure managed Prometheus and Grafana impose service-specific scale limitations. For more information, seeScrape Prometheus metrics at scale in Azure Monitor.
