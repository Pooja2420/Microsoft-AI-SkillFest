You can configure an inboundprivate endpointfor your API Management instance to allow clients in your private network to securely access the instance overAzure Private Link.
Note
Private endpoint support in the Standard v2 tier is currently in preview.
The private endpoint uses an IP address from an Azure virtual network in which it's hosted.
The private endpoint uses an IP address from an Azure virtual network in which it's hosted.
Network traffic between a client on your private network and API Management traverses over the virtual network and a Private Link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.

Important
You can only configure a private endpoint connection forinboundtraffic to the API Management instance.
Limitations
Only the API Management instance'sGateway endpointsupports inbound Private Link connections.
Each API Management instance supports at most 100 Private Link connections.
Connections aren't supported on theself-hosted gatewayor on aworkspace gateway.
In the classic API Management tiers, private endpoints aren't supported in instances injected in an internal or external virtual network.
Typical scenarios
Use an inbound private endpoint to enable private-only access directly to the API Management gateway to limit exposure of sensitive data or backends.
Supported configurations include:
Pass client requests through a firewall and configure rules to route requests privately to the API Management gateway.
Configure Azure Front Door (or Azure Front Door with Azure Application Gateway) to receive external traffic and then route traffic privately to the API Management gateway. For example, seeConnect Azure Front Door Premium to an Azure API Management with Private Link.
Prerequisites
An existing API Management instance.Create one if you haven't already.When using an instance in the classic Developer or Premium tier, don't deploy (inject) the instance into anexternalorinternalvirtual network.

(Recommended) A virtual machine in the same or a different subnet in the virtual network, to test the private endpoint.

Approval method for private endpoint
Typically, a network administrator creates a private endpoint. Depending on your Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, a private endpoint that you create is eitherautomatically approvedto send traffic to the API Management instance, or requires the resource owner tomanually approvethe connection.

Steps to configure private endpoint
Get available private endpoint types in subscription
Disable network policies in subnet
Create private endpoint - portal
Get available private endpoint types in subscription
Verify that the API Management private endpoint type is available in your subscription and location. In the portal, find this information by going to thePrivate Link Center. SelectSupported resources.
You can also find this information by using theAvailable Private Endpoint Types - ListREST API.
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/{region}/availablePrivateEndpointTypes?api-version=2021-03-01
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/{region}/availablePrivateEndpointTypes?api-version=2021-03-01
Output should include theMicrosoft.ApiManagement.serviceendpoint type:

Disable network policies in subnet
Network policies such as network security groups must be disabled in the subnet used for the private endpoint.
If you use tools such as Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or REST API to configure private endpoints, update the subnet configuration manually. For examples, seeManage network policies for private endpoints.
When you use the Azure portal to create a private endpoint, as shown in the next section, network policies are disabled automatically as part of the creation process.
Create private endpoint - portal
You can create a private endpoint when you create an API Management instance in the Azure portal, or you can add a private endpoint to an existing instance. You can also create a private endpoint using thePrivate Link Center.

List private endpoint connections to the instance
After the private endpoint is created and the service updated, it appears in the list on the API Management instance'sInbound private endpoint connectionspage in the portal.
Note the endpoint'sConnection state:
Approvedindicates that the API Management resource automatically approved the connection.
Pendingindicates that the connection must be manually approved by the resource owner.
Approve pending private endpoint connections
If a private endpoint connection is in a pending state, an owner of the API Management instance must manually approve it before it can be used.
If you have sufficient permissions, approve a private endpoint connection on the API Management instance'sPrivate endpoint connectionspage in the portal. In the connection's context (...) menu, selectApprove.
You can also use the API ManagementPrivate Endpoint Connection - Create Or UpdateREST API to approve pending private endpoint connections.

Optionally disable public network access
To optionally limit incoming traffic to the API Management instance only to private endpoints, disable the public network access property.
Note
Public network access can only be disabled in API Management instances configured with a private endpoint, not with other networking configurations.
Classic
Standard v2
To disable the public network access property in the classic tiers using the Azure CLI, run the followingaz apim updatecommand, substituting the names of your API Management instance and resource group:
az apim update --name my-apim-service --resource-group my-resource-group --public-network-access false
az apim update --name my-apim-service --resource-group my-resource-group --public-network-access false
You can also use theAPI Management Service - UpdateREST API to disable public network access, by setting thepublicNetworkAccessproperty toDisabled.

Test in virtual network
Connect to a virtual machine you set up in the virtual network.
Run a utility such asnslookupordigto look up the IP address of your default Gateway endpoint over Private Link. For example:
nslookup
dig
nslookup my-apim-service.privatelink.azure-api.net
nslookup my-apim-service.privatelink.azure-api.net
Output should include the private IP address associated with the private endpoint.
API calls initiated within the virtual network to the default Gateway endpoint should succeed.
Test from internet
From outside the private endpoint path, attempt to call the API Management instance's default Gateway endpoint. If public access is disabled, output includes an error with status code403and a message similar to:
403
Request originated from client public IP address 192.0.2.12, public network access on this 'Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/my-apim-service' is disabled.
       
To connect to 'Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/my-apim-service', please use the Private Endpoint from inside your virtual network.
