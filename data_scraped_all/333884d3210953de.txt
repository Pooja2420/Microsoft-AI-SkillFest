Organizations use many Azure services and manage them from Azure Resource Manager based tools like:
Azure portal
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
These tools can provide highly privileged access to resources that can make the following changes:
Alter subscription-wide configurations
Service settings
Subscription billing
To protect these privileged resources, Microsoft recommends requiring multifactor authentication for any user accessing these resources. In Microsoft Entra ID, these tools are grouped together in a suite calledWindows Azure Service Management API. For Azure Government, this suite should be the Azure Government Cloud Management API app.
User exclusions
Conditional Access policies are powerful tools, we recommend excluding the following accounts from your policies:
Emergency accessorbreak-glassaccounts to prevent lockout due to policy misconfiguration. In the unlikely scenario all administrators are locked out, your emergency-access administrative account can be used to log in and take steps to recover access.More information can be found in the article,Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID.

Service accountsandService principals, such as the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Account. Service accounts are non-interactive accounts that aren't tied to any particular user. They're normally used by back-end services allowing programmatic access to applications, but are also used to sign in to systems for administrative purposes. Calls made by service principals won't be blocked by Conditional Access policies scoped to users. Use Conditional Access for workload identities to define policies targeting service principals.If your organization has these accounts in use in scripts or code, consider replacing them withmanaged identities.

Template deployment
Organizations can choose to deploy this policy using the steps outlined below or using theConditional Access templates.
Create a Conditional Access policy
The following steps help create a Conditional Access policy to require users who access theWindows Azure Service Management APIsuite do multifactor authentication.
Caution
Make sure you understand how Conditional Access works before setting up a policy to manage access to Windows Azure Service Management API. Make sure you don't create conditions that could block your own access to the portal.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aConditional Access Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Conditional Access>Policies.
SelectNew policy.
Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
