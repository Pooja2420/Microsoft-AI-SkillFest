In this quickstart, you create a key vault withAzure PowerShell. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store forkeys,secrets, andcertificates. For more information on Key Vault, seeAbout Azure Key Vault; for more information on what can be stored in a key vault, seeAbout keys, secrets, and certificates.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
If you choose to use Azure PowerShell locally:Install the latest version of the Az PowerShell module.Connect to your Azure account using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet.
Install the latest version of the Az PowerShell module.
Connect to your Azure account using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet.
If you choose to use Azure Cloud Shell:SeeOverview of Azure Cloud Shellfor more information.
SeeOverview of Azure Cloud Shellfor more information.
Create a resource group
A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Use the Azure PowerShellNew-AzResourceGroupcmdlet to create a resource group namedmyResourceGroupin theeastuslocation.
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
Create a key vault
Use the Azure PowerShellNew-AzKeyVaultcmdlet to create a Key Vault in the resource group from the previous step. You need to provide some information:
Key vault name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)ImportantEach key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.
Key vault name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)
Important
Each key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.
Resource group name:myResourceGroup.
Resource group name:myResourceGroup.
The location:EastUS.
The location:EastUS.
New-AzKeyVault -Name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
New-AzKeyVault -Name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "EastUS"
The output of this cmdlet shows properties of the newly created key vault. Take note of these two properties:
Vault Name: The name you provided to the -Name parameter.
Vault URI: In the example, this URI is https://<your-unique-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/. Applications that use your vault through its REST API must use this URI.
At this point, your Azure account is the only one authorized to perform any operations on this new vault.
Clean up resources
Other quickstarts and tutorials in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with other quickstarts and tutorials, you may want to leave these resources in place.
When no longer needed, you can use the Azure PowerShellRemove-AzResourceGroupcmdlet to remove the resource group and all related resources.
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
