This article teaches you how to grant permissions to the managed identity in Azure Synapse workspace. Permissions, in turn, allow access to dedicated SQL pools in the workspace and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account through the Azure portal.
Note
This workspace managed identity is referred to as managed identity through the rest of this document.
Grant the managed identity permissions to Data Lake Storage account
A Data Lake Storage Gen2 account is required to create an Azure Synapse workspace. To successfully launch Spark pools in Azure Synapse workspace, the Azure Synapse managed identity needs theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole on this storage account. Pipeline orchestration in Azure Synapse also benefits from this role.
Grant permissions to managed identity during workspace creation
Azure Synapse attempts to grant theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the managed identity after you create the Azure Synapse workspace using the Azure portal. You provide the Data Lake Storage account details in theBasicstab.

Choose the Data Lake Storage Gen2 account and filesystem inAccount nameandFile system name.

If the workspace creator is alsoOwnerof the Data Lake Storage account, then Azure Synapse assigns theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the managed identity. The following message appears.

If the workspace creator isn't the owner of the Data Lake Storage account, then Azure Synapse doesn't assign theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the managed identity. The following message notifies the workspace creator that they don't have sufficient permissions to grant theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the managed identity.

You can't create Spark pools unless theStorage Blob Data Contributoris assigned to the managed identity.
Grant permissions to managed identity after workspace creation
During workspace creation, if you don't assign theStorage Blob Data contributorto the managed identity, then theOwnerof the Data Lake Storage Gen2 account manually assigns that role to the identity. The following steps help you to accomplish manual assignment.
In the Azure portal, open the Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account and selectContainersfrom the left navigation. You only need to assign theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole at the container or filesystem level.

The managed identity should have data access to the container (file system) that was provided when the workspace was created. You can find this container or file system in the Azure portal. Open the Azure Synapse workspace in the Azure portal and select theOverviewtab from the left navigation.

Select that same container or file system to grant theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the managed identity.

SelectAccess control (IAM)from the resource menu.

You should see your managed identity listed under theStorage Blob Data Contributorsection with theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole assigned to it.

Instead of granting yourself aStorage Blob Data Contributorrole, you can also grant more granular permissions on a subset of files.
All users who need access to some data in this container also must have EXECUTE permission on all parent folders up to the root (the container).
To learn more, seeUse Azure Storage Explorer to manage ACLs in Azure Data Lake Storage.
Note
Execute permission on the container level must be set within Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Permissions on the folder can be set within Azure Synapse.
If you want to querydata2.csvin this example, the following permissions are needed:
Execute permission on container
Execute permission on folder1
Read permission on data2.csv

Sign in to Azure Synapse with an admin user that has full permissions on the data you want to access.

Grant read permission for this user.

Note
For guest users, this step needs to be done directly with Azure Data Lake because it can't be done directly through Azure Synapse.
