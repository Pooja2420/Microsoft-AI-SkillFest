This article shows you how to implementdynamic data maskingwith the Azure portal. You can also implement dynamic data masking usingAzure SQL Database cmdletsor theREST API.
Note
This feature cannot be set using portal for SQL Managed Instance (use PowerShell or REST API). For more information, seeDynamic Data Masking.

In theDynamic Data Maskingconfiguration page, you may see some database columns that the recommendations engine has flagged for masking. In order to accept the recommendations, just clickAdd Maskfor one or more columns and a mask is created based on the default type for this column. You can change the masking function by clicking on the masking rule and editing the masking field format to a different format of your choice. Be sure to clickSaveto save your settings.

Type the SQL authenticated users or authenticated identities from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) that should be excluded from masking, and have access to the unmasked sensitive data. This should be a semicolon-separated list of users. Users with administrator privileges always have access to the original unmasked data.TipTo make it so the application layer can display sensitive data for application privileged users, add the SQL user or Microsoft Entra identity the application uses to query the database. It is highly recommended that this list contain a minimal number of privileged users to minimize exposure of the sensitive data.
