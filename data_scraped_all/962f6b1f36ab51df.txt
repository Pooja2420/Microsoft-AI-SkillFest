Migrate IBM i series to Azure with Skytap
This example architecture shows how to use the native IBM i backup and recovery services with Microsoft Azure components to quickly migrate IBM i workloads to Skytap on Azure. This native IBM Power9 infrastructure is hosted in an Azure datacenter, minimizing the latency between traditional workloads and those running natively on Azure. You get the reliability and reach of Azure, the flexibility to deploy and scale IBM i logical partitions (LPARs) on demand, plus full backup and recovery services through Azure Storage.

Components
The architecture uses these components:
Skytap on Azureis a service that runs IBM Power and x86 traditional workloads on hardware in Azure datacenters. Organizations of any size that run applications on IBM Powerâbased AIX, IBM i, or Linux operating systems can migrate them to Azure with little upfront effort.

Azure Virtual Networkis the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. As a software defined network, a virtual network (VNet) provides an isolated environment for VMs and other Azure resources to communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

Alternatives
You can connect to IBM i instances running in Skytap on Azure across a virtual private network (VPN) or the internet. For example, you can use SSH (Secure Shell) to access your IBM i applications on Azure.

To maximize security and minimize the number of open ports, you can use VMs as bastion hosts for administrative access to the LPARs. The bastion host runs within the VNet on Azure. For example, administrators can use a 5250 terminal emulator to access their IBM i systems.

In a high availability scenario, you can replicate journal data over your organization's ExpressRoute or VPN connection in near real-time. In case of a failure, you can perform a role swap for a near immediate failover.

Scenario details
The IBM System i family of midrange computers was first introduced in 1988 as the AS/400. Until now, your choice was to rearchitect iSeries applications before moving them to the cloud or maintain them on-premises or in a co-located facilityâboth expensive options.
In this example, a web app on Azure gives users a modern interface for the resources running in Skytap on Azure. You can continue to run critical components or systems of record (SOR) on IBM i on-premises. You can also migrate complete IBM i workloads and modernize them using native Azure services, such as advanced analytics and machine learning. In this type of all-cloud scenario, Skytap on Azure helps you optimize costs.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Skytap on Azure has high reliability built on IBM Power9 Systems backed by SSD RAID 6+1 storage and 10 Gb/sec backplane networking.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
Skytap on Azure meets industry cloud security requirements, including System and Organization Controls for Service Organizations 2 (SOC 2) and SOC 3 attestations and compliance with ISO 27001 and PCI DSS 3.2.
To learn more about how Skytap secures your workloads, you can get more information in theSkytap Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
Running IBM i series workloads in Skytap on Azure helps optimize costs compared to on-premises deployments. The consumption-based usage plans let you deploy LPARs only as needed and scale them on demand to meet the needs of your workloads.
See more pricing information on thePlans + Pricingtab of Skytap on Azure in Azure Marketplace.
Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
Skytap on Azure provides high performance and efficiency that support demanding workloads up to 44,000 CPWs and 512 GB of RAM, while providing the benefits of cloud scale. With capacity on demand and pay-as-you-go pricing, you save the expense of adding hardware on premises to meet changing demands. You can use smaller LPARs instead of a few large ones and configure resources as needed.
One of the advantages of an Azureâbased solution is the ability to scale out. Scaling makes nearly limitless compute capacity available to an application. Azure supports multiple methods to scale out compute power, such asvirtual machine scale setsandload balancingacross a cluster. Other services scale compute resources dynamically. In addition, applications on Azure can also useKubernetes clustersas compute services for specified resources.
Azure compute scale-up can be as simple as choosing the rightvirtual machinefor your workload.
