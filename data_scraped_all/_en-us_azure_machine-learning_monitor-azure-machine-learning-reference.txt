This article contains all the monitoring reference information for this service.
SeeMonitor Machine Learningfor details on the data you can collect for Azure Machine Learning and how to use it.
Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list ofall platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor.
For information on metric retention, seeAzure Monitor Metrics overview.
The resource provider for these metrics is Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces.
The metrics categories areModel,Quota,Resource,Run, andTraffic.Quotainformation is for Machine Learning compute only.Runprovides information on training runs for the workspace.
