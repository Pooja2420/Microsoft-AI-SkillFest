To access and run IBM mainframe apps on Customer Information Control System (CICS) systems from Standard workflows in Azure Logic Apps, you can use theCICS Program Callbuilt-in, service provider-based connector. CICS provides a Transaction Program (TP) Monitor with an integrated Transaction Manager (TM). The connector communicates with IBM CICS transaction programs by using TCP/IP. The CICS connector is available in all Azure Logic Apps regions except for Azure Government and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.
This article describes the following aspects about the CICS connector:
Scenarios for using the CICS connector in Azure Logic Apps
Prerequisites and setup for using the CICS connector
Steps for adding CICS connector actions to your Standard logic app workflow
Review the connector usage scenarios
CICS systems were one of the first mission-critical systems that run on mainframes. MicrosoftHost Integration Server (HIS)provides connectivity to CICS systems using TCP/IP, HTTP, and APPC LU6.2. Customers have used the HIS Transaction Integrator to integrate CICS systems with on-premises Windows for many years. TheCICS Program Callconnector uses TCP/IP and HTTPprogramming modelsto interact with CICS transaction programs.
The following diagram shows how the CICS connector interacts with an IBM mainframe system:

To extend these hybrid cloud scenarios, the CICS connector in a Standard workflow works with theHIS Designer for Logic Apps, which you can use to create aprogram definitionorprogram mapof the mainframe transaction program. For this task, the HIS Designer uses aprogramming modelthat determines the characteristics of the data exchange between the mainframe and the workflow. The HIS Designer converts that information into metadata that the CICS connector uses when running an action in your workflow.
After you generate the metadata file as a Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file from the HIS Designer, you can add that file as a map artifact to your Standard logic app resource. That way, your workflow can access your app's metadata when you add a CICS connector action. The connector reads the metadata file from your logic app resource, and dynamically presents parameters to use with the CICS connector in your workflow. You can then provide parameters to the host application, and the connector returns the results to your workflow. As a result, you can integrate your legacy apps with Azure, Microsoft, other apps, services, and systems that Azure Logic Apps supports.
Connector technical reference
Currently, one operation is available for the CICS connector:Call a CICS program. The following table summarizes the usage for this action:
This operation also includes advanced parameters, which appear after you select a method, for you to select and use with the selected method. These parameters vary based on your HIDX file and the method that you select.

The Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file that provides the necessary metadata for theCICS Program Callconnector to execute your mainframe program.To create this HIDX file,download and install the HIS Designer for Azure Logic Apps. The only prerequisite isMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8.To invoke a mainframe program, your workflow needs to understand the mainframe program's type, parameters, and return values. The CICS connector manages this process and data conversions. The conversions provide input data from the workflow to the mainframe program and send any output data generated from the mainframe program to the workflow. The connector also provides tabular data definition and code page translation. For this process, Azure Logic Apps requires that you provide this information as metadata.To create this metadata, use theHIS Designer for Logic Apps. With this tool, you can manually create the methods, parameters, and return values that you use in your workflow. You can also import COBOL or RPG program definitions (copybooks) that provide this information.The tool generates a Host Integration Designer XML (HIDX) file that provides the necessary metadata for the connector. If you're using HIS, you can use the HIS Transaction Integrator (TI) Designer to create the HIDX file.

The Standard logic app workflow where you want to integrate with the CICS system.The CICS connector doesn't have triggers, so use any trigger to start your workflow, such as theRecurrencetrigger orRequesttrigger. You can then add the CICS connector actions. To get started, create a blank workflow in your Standard logic app resource.

Limitations
Currently, the CICS connector requires that you upload your HIDX file directly to your Standard logic app resource, not an integration account.
Define and generate metadata
After you download and install the HIS Designer for Azure Logic Apps, followthese steps to generate the HIDX file from the metadata artifact.
Upload the HIDX file
For your workflow to use the HIDX file, follow these steps:
Go to the folder where you saved your HIDX file, and copy the file.
Go to the folder where you saved your HIDX file, and copy the file.
In theAzure portal,upload the HIDX file as a map to your Standard logic app resource.

Later in this article, when you add aCICS Program Callconnector action to your workflow for the first time, a prompt asks you to create a connection between your workflow and the mainframe system. After you create the connection, you can select your previously added HIDX file, the method to run, and the parameters to use.
Add a CICS action
Follow these steps to add a CICS action and configure the necessary parameters:
In theAzure portal, open your Standard logic app resource and workflow in the designer.
