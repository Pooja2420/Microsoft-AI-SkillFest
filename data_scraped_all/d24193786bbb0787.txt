HTTP "502 Bad Gateway" and "503 Service Unavailable" are common errors that you can get when you open an app that you host inAzure App Service. This article helps you troubleshoot these errors.
If you need more help, you can contact the Azure experts atAzure Community Support. Or, you can use resources at theAzure Support site.
The cause of these errors is often an application-level problem, such as:
Requests are taking a long time.
The app is using high memory or CPU.
An exception is preventing the app from responding.
Troubleshooting consists of three tasks, in sequential order:
Observe and monitor application behavior.
Collect data.
Mitigate the problem.
App Service gives you options for each task.

Observe and monitor application behavior
Azure App Service provides several ways to observe app behavior.
Track service health
Azure publicizes service interruptions and performance degradations in App Service. You can track the health of the service in theAzure portal. For more information, seeView service health notifications by using the Azure portal.
Monitor your app
You can monitor your app to find out if it's having any problems. On the Azure portal page for your app, selectMonitoring>Metrics. TheMetricdropdown menu shows you the metrics that you can add.
Some of the metrics that you might want to monitor for your app are:
Average memory working set
CPU time
Memory working set
Requests

For more information, see:
Azure App Service quotas and metrics
What are Azure Monitor alerts?

Collect data
Collect data by using diagnostics or the Kudu debug console.
Use the diagnostics feature
App Service provides an intelligent and interactive experience to help you troubleshoot your app, with no configuration required. The diagnostics feature can discover a problem and guide you to the right information for troubleshooting and resolution.
To access App Service diagnostics, go to your App Service app or App Service Environment in theAzure portal. On the left menu, selectDiagnose and solve problems.
Use the Kudu debug console
App Service comes with a console that you can use for debugging, exploring, and uploading files. It also provides JSON endpoints that you can use to get information about your environment. This console is part of the Kudu dashboard for your app.
In the Azure portal, go to your app. In the left menu, selectDevelopment Tools>Advanced Tools. SelectGoto open Kudu in a new browser window.
By default, your app domain includes these elements:<app-name>-<random-hash>.<region>. You can also access the dashboard by going to the linkhttps://<app-name>-<random-hash>.scm.<region>.azurewebsites.net/.  To get the random hash and region values, in your appOverview, copyDefault domain.
<app-name>
<random-hash>
<region>
https://<app-name>-<random-hash>.scm.<region>.azurewebsites.net/
Kudu provides:
Environment settings for your application.
A log stream.
A diagnostic dump.
The debug console, in which you can run PowerShell cmdlets and basic DOS commands.
If your application is throwing first-chance exceptions, you can use Kudu and the Sysinternals tool ProcDump to create memory dumps. These memory dumps are snapshots of the process and can help you troubleshoot more complicated problems with your app.
For more information on features available in Kudu, see the blog postKudu Dashboard explained - WordPress on App Service.

Mitigate the problem
Consider these options to address these issues.
Scale the app
In Azure App Service, for increased performance and throughput, you can adjust the scale at which you run your application. Scaling up an app involves two related actions:
Changing your App Service plan to a higher pricing tier
Configuring certain settings after you switch to a higher pricing tier
For more information on scaling, seeScale an app in Azure App Service.
You can also choose to run your application on more than one instance. This choice provides you with more processing capability and also gives you some fault tolerance. If the process goes down on one instance, the other instance continues to serve requests.
You can set the scaling to be manual or automatic.
Use auto-healing
Auto-healing recycles the worker process for your app based on settings that you choose. The settings include configuration changes, requests, memory-based limits, or the time needed to execute a request.
Most of the time, recycling the process is the fastest way to recover from a problem. Though you can always restart the app directly in the Azure portal, auto-healing can do it automatically for you. All you need to do is add some triggers in the rootWeb.configfile for your app. These settings work in the same way even if your application isn't a .NET one.
Web.config
For more information, seeAzure App Service diagnostics overview.
Restart the app
Restarting your app is often the simplest way to recover from one-time problems. On theAzure portalpage for your app, you can stop or restart your app.

You can also manage your app by using Azure PowerShell. For more information, seeManage Azure resources by using Azure PowerShell.
