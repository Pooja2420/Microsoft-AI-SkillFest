The Protected material detection APIs scan the output of large language models to identify and flag known protected material. The APIs are designed to help organizations prevent the generation of content that closely matches copyrighted text or code.
TheProtected material text APIflags known text content (for example, song lyrics, articles, recipes, and selected web content) that might be output by large language models.
TheProtected material code APIflags protected code content (from known GitHub repositories, including software libraries, source code, algorithms, and other proprietary programming content) that might be output by large language models.
Caution
The Content Safety service's code scanner/indexer is only current through April 6, 2023. Code that was added to GitHub after this date won't be detected. Use your own discretion when using Protected Material for Code to detect recent bodies of code.
By detecting and preventing the display of protected material, organizations can ensure compliance with intellectual property laws, maintain content originality, and protect their reputations.
This guide provides details about the kinds of content that the protected material API detects.
User scenarios
Protected text
Protected code
Content generation platforms for creative writing
Scenario: A content generation platform that uses generative AI for creative writing (for example, blog posts, stories, marketing copy) integrates the Protected Material for Text feature to prevent the generation of content that closely matches known copyrighted material.
User: Platform administrators and content creators.
Action: The platform uses Azure AI Content Safety to scan AI-generated content before it's provided to users. If the generated text matches protected material, the content is flagged and either blocked or revised.
Outcome: The platform avoids potential copyright infringements and ensures that all generated content is original and compliant with intellectual property laws.
Automated social media content creation
Scenario: A digital marketing agency uses generative AI to automate social media content creation. The agency integrates the Protected Material for Text feature to avoid publishing AI-generated content that includes copyrighted text, such as song lyrics or excerpts from books.
User: Digital marketers and social media managers.
Action: The agency employs Azure AI Content Safety to check all AI-generated social media content for matches against a database of protected material. Content that matches is flagged for revision or blocked from posting.
Outcome: The agency maintains compliance with copyright laws and avoids reputation risks associated with posting unauthorized content.
AI-assisted news writing
Scenario: A news outlet uses generative AI to assist journalists in drafting articles and reports. To ensure the content does not unintentionally replicate protected news articles or other copyrighted material, the outlet uses the Protected Material for Text feature.
User: Journalists, editors, and compliance officers.
Action: The news outlet integrates Azure AI Content Safety into its content creation workflow. AI-generated drafts are automatically scanned for protected content before submission for editorial review.
Outcome: The news outlet prevents accidental copyright violations and maintains the integrity and originality of its reporting.
E-learning platforms using AI for content generation
Scenario: An e-learning platform employs generative AI to generate educational content, such as summaries, quizzes, and explanatory text. The platform uses the Protected Material for Text feature to ensure the generated content does not include protected material from textbooks, articles, or academic papers.
User: Educational content creators and compliance officers.
Action: The platform integrates the feature to scan AI-generated educational materials. If any content matches known protected academic material, it's flagged for revision or automatically removed.
Outcome: The platform maintains educational content quality and complies with copyright laws, avoiding the use of protected material in AI-generated learning resources.
AI-powered recipe generators
Scenario: A food and recipe website uses generative AI to generate new recipes based on user preferences. To avoid generating content that matches protected recipes from famous cookbooks or websites, the website integrates the Protected Material for Text feature.
User: Content managers and platform administrators.
Action: The website uses Azure AI Content Safety to check AI-generated recipes against a database of known protected content. If a generated recipe matches a protected one, it's flagged and revised or blocked.
Outcome: The website ensures that all AI-generated recipes are original, reducing the risk of copyright infringement.
Software Development Platforms
Scenario: A software development platform that utilizes generative AI to help developers write code integrates the Protected Material for Code feature to prevent the generation of code that replicates material from existing GitHub repositories.
User: Platform administrators, developers.
Action: The platform uses Azure AI Content Safety to scan AI-generated code. If any code matches protected material, it's flagged for review, revised, or blocked.
Outcome: The platform ensures that all AI-generated code is original and complies with licensing agreements, reducing legal and compliance risks.
Automated Code Writing Tools
Scenario: A development team uses generative AI to automate parts of their code writing. The team integrates the Protected Material for Code feature to prevent the accidental use of code snippets that match content from existing GitHub repositories, including open-source code with restrictive licenses.
User: Software developers, DevOps teams.
Action: Azure AI Content Safety checks the generated code against known material from GitHub repositories. If a match is found, the code is flagged and revised before it's incorporated into the project.
Outcome: The team avoids potential copyright infringement and ensures the AI-generated code adheres to appropriate licenses.
AI-assisted Code Reviews
Scenario: A software company integrates AI-assisted code review tools into its development process. To avoid introducing protected code from GitHub or external libraries, the company uses the Protected Material for Code feature.
User: Code reviewers, software developers, compliance officers.
Action: The company scans all AI-generated code for matches against protected material from GitHub repositories before final code review and deployment.
Outcome: The company prevents the inclusion of protected material in their projects, maintaining compliance with intellectual property laws and internal standards.
AI-generated Code for Educational Platforms
Scenario: An e-learning platform uses generative AI to generate example code for programming tutorials and courses. The platform integrates the Protected Material for Code feature to ensure that generated examples do not duplicate code from existing GitHub repositories or other educational sources.
User: Course creators, platform administrators.
Action: Azure AI Content Safety checks all AI-generated code examples for protected content. Matches are flagged, reviewed, and revised.
Outcome: The platform maintains the integrity and originality of its educational content while adhering to copyright laws.
AI-powered Coding Assistants
Scenario: A coding assistant tool powered by generative AI helps developers by generating code suggestions. To ensure that no suggestions infringe on code from GitHub repositories, the assistant tool uses the Protected Material for Code feature.
User: Developers, tool administrators.
Action: The tool scans all code suggestions for protected material from GitHub before presenting them to developers. If a suggestion matches protected code, it's flagged and not shown.
Outcome: The coding assistant ensures that all code suggestions are free from protected content, fostering originality and reducing legal risks.
By integrating the Protected Material for Code feature, organizations can manage risks associated with AI-generated code, maintain compliance with intellectual property laws, and ensure the originality of their code outputs.
