Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list ofall platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor.
For information on metric retention, seeAzure Monitor Metrics overview.
Supported metrics for Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses resource type.
All columns might not be present in every table.
Some columns might be beyond the viewing area of the page. SelectExpand tableto view all available columns.
Table headings
Category- The metrics group or classification.
Metric- The metric display name as it appears in the Azure portal.
Name in REST API- The metric name as referred to in theREST API.
Unit- Unit of measure.
Aggregation- The defaultaggregationtype. Valid values: Average (Avg), Minimum (Min), Maximum (Max), Total (Sum), Count.
Dimensions-Dimensionsavailable for the metric.
Time Grains-Intervalsat which the metric is sampled. For example,PT1Mindicates that the metric is sampled every minute,PT30Mevery 30 minutes,PT1Hevery hour, and so on.
PT1M

The metric names present different packet types, and bytes vs. packets, with a basic construct of tag names on each metric as follows:
Dropped tag name(for example,Inbound Packets Dropped DDoS): The number of packets dropped/scrubbed by the DDoS protection system.
Dropped tag name(for example,Inbound Packets Dropped DDoS): The number of packets dropped/scrubbed by the DDoS protection system.
Forwarded tag name(for exampleInbound Packets Forwarded DDoS): The number of packets forwarded by the DDoS system to the destination VIP â traffic that wasn't filtered.
Forwarded tag name(for exampleInbound Packets Forwarded DDoS): The number of packets forwarded by the DDoS system to the destination VIP â traffic that wasn't filtered.
No tag name(for exampleInbound Packets DDoS): The total number of packets that came into the scrubbing system â representing the sum of the packets dropped and forwarded.
No tag name(for exampleInbound Packets DDoS): The total number of packets that came into the scrubbing system â representing the sum of the packets dropped and forwarded.
Note
While multiple options forAggregationare displayed on Azure portal, only the aggregation types listed in the table are supported for each metric. We apologize for this confusion and we are working to resolve it.
