IBM z/OS mainframe migration with Avanade AMT
This article describes howAvanade's Automated Migration Technology (AMT)migrates an IBM z/OS mainframe system to the Azure cloud. The Avanade AMT framework converts proprietary IBM z/OS mainframe applications into native .NET applications that run on Windows Server OS or Linux OS virtual machines (VMs). On-premises mainframe resources migrate to cost-effective, scalable, secure Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) environments.

Workflow
The preceding diagram shows how the typical components of an IBM z/OS mainframe system can map and migrate to Azure capabilities.
A web browser accesses Azure resources, which replaces standard mainframe protocols like HTTPS andTN3270 terminal emulation. Users access web-based applications over a private Azure ExpressRoute connection through Transport Layer Security (TLS) port 443.

For security and performance, this solution deploys all Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group helps manage traffic.

Avanade AMT converts mainframe presentation loads to VM server farms. Two sets of two VMs run the web and application layers. The VMs use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk Storage with accelerated networking for high performance.Azure Load Balancer fronts these VMs in anactive-activearrangement to spread query traffic.Presentation layer code runs in Internet Information Services (IIS) and uses ASP.NET to maintain the z/OS mainframe user interface screens. You can leave web applications' presentation layers unchanged, to minimize user retraining, or you can update the presentation layers with modern user experience frameworks.

Use the Avanade AMT framework to quickly move resources to Azure without rewriting application code or redesigning data architecture. The migration framework converts legacy code to .NET C# or Java, while maintaining the source code layout in its original form. You don't have to change application user interfaces and interactions, which minimizes the need for user retraining.
Potential use cases
The Avanade AMT framework supports several methodologies to move your workloads to Azure:
Whole system conversion: You can convert and move the entire mainframe system to Azure at one time, which reduces interim mainframe maintenance and facility support costs. You should carefully consider and manage this approach because all processes, such as application conversion, data migration, and testing, must align for a smooth transition.

Phased application transition: You can move applications from the mainframe to Azure gradually, eventually completing a full transition. You can save money on individual applications. You can also learn about the conversion for each application, and apply those lessons to subsequent conversions.

Resource optimization with phased transition: If your goal is to release resources on the mainframe, the phased method can provide more processing cycles on the mainframe because you convert and migrate applications to Azure. This method results in a more complex migration due to various factors, including setting up temporary interfaces to the mainframe and decoupling complex code. You can retire the mainframe after all migration phases are complete.
