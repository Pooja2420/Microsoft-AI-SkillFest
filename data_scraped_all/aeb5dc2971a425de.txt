Azure Files is a Microsoft file storage solution for the cloud. Azure Files provides server message block (SMB) and network file system (NFS) file shares that you can mount to clients in the cloud, on-premises, or to both. You can also use Azure File Sync to cache SMB file shares on a local Windows server and tier infrequently used files to the cloud.
This article assumes that as an architect, you've reviewed thestorage optionsand chosen Azure Files as the storage service on which to run your workloads. The guidance in this article provides architectural recommendations that are mapped to the principles of theAzure Well-Architected Framework pillars.
Important
How to use this guide
Each section has adesign checklistthat presents architectural areas of concern along with design strategies localized to the technology scope.
Also included arerecommendationson the technology capabilities that can help implement those strategies. The recommendations don't represent an exhaustive list of all configurations available for Azure Files and its dependencies. Instead, they list the key recommendations mapped to the design perspectives. Use the recommendations to build your proof-of-concept or optimize your existing environments.
Reliability
The purpose of the Reliability pillar is to provide continued functionality bybuilding enough resilience and the ability to recover fast from failures.
TheReliability design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy applied for individual components, workloads, system flows, and the system as a whole.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Reliability.
Use failure mode analysis: Minimize points of failure by considering internal dependencies such as the availability of virtual networks, Azure Key Vault, or Azure Content Delivery Network or Azure Front Door endpoints. Failures can occur if you need credentials to access Azure Files, and the credentials go missing from Key Vault. Or you might have a failure if your workloads use an endpoint that's based on a missing content delivery network. In these cases, you might need to configure your workloads to connect to an alternative endpoint. For general information about failure mode analysis, seeRecommendations for performing failure mode analysis.

For general information about failure mode analysis, seeRecommendations for performing failure mode analysis.
Define reliability and recovery targets: Review theAzure service-level agreements (SLAs). Derive the service-level objective (SLO) for the storage account. For example, the redundancy configuration that you chose might affect the SLO. Consider the effect of a regional outage, the potential for data loss, and the time required to restore access after an outage. Also consider the availability of internal dependencies that you identified as part of your failure mode analysis.

Design applications:Design your applicationsto seamlessly shift so that they read data from a secondary region if the primary region is unavailable. This design consideration only applies to geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) configurations. Design your applications to properly handle outages, which reduces downtime for customers.

Recommendations
Security
The purpose of the Security pillar is to provideconfidentiality, integrity, and availabilityguarantees to the workload.
TheSecurity design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those goals by applying approaches to the technical design of your file storage configuration.
Security requirements and recommendations vary depending on whether your workload uses the SMB or NFS protocol to access your file shares. So the following sections have separate design checklists and recommendations for SMB and NFS file shares.
As a best practice, you should keep SMB and NFS file shares in separate storage accounts because they have different security requirements. Use this approach to provide your workload with strong security and high flexibility.
Design checklist for SMB file shares
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Security. Identify vulnerabilities and controls to improve the security posture. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.

Consider using network controls to restrict ingress and egress traffic: You might be comfortable exposing your storage account to the public internet under certain conditions, like if you use identity-based authentication to grant access to file shares. But we recommend that you use network controls to grant the minimum required level of access to users and applications. For more information, seeHow to approach network security for your storage account.

Minimize the use of storage account keys:Identity-based authenticationprovides superior security compared to using a storage account key. But you must use a storage account key to get full administrative control of a file share, including the ability to take ownership of a file. Grant security principals only the necessary permissions that they need to perform their tasks.

Detect threats: EnableMicrosoft Defender for Storageto detect potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your Azure file shares over SMB or FileREST protocols. Subscription administrators get email alerts with details of suspicious activity and recommendations about how to investigate and remediate threats. Defender for Storage doesn't support antivirus capabilities for Azure file shares. If you use Defender for Storage, transaction-heavy file shares incur significant costs, so consider opting out of Defender for Storage for specific storage accounts.

Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization focuses ondetecting spend patterns, prioritizing investments in critical areas, and optimizing in othersto meet the organization's budget while meeting business requirements.
TheCost Optimization design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those goals and making tradeoffs as necessary in the technical design related to file storage and its environment.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Cost Optimizationfor investments. Fine tune the design so that the workload is aligned with the budget that's allocated for the workload. Your design should use the right Azure capabilities, monitor investments, and find opportunities to optimize over time.
Decide whether your workload requires the performance of premium file shares (Azure Premium SSD) or if Azure Standard HDD storage is sufficient: Determine your storage account type and billing model based on the type of storage that you need. If you require large amounts of input/output operations per second (IOPS), extremely fast data transfer speeds, or very low latency, then you should choose premium Azure file shares. NFS Azure file shares are only available on the premium tier. NFS and SMB file shares are the same price on the premium tier.

Create a storage account for your file share, and choose a redundancy level: Choose either a standard (GPv2) or premium (FileStorage) account. The redundancy level that you choose affects cost. The more redundancy, the higher the cost. Locally redundant storage (LRS) is the most affordable. GRS is only available for standard SMB file shares. Standard file shares only show transaction information at the storage account level, so we recommend that you deploy only one file share in each storage account to ensure full billing visibility.

Understand how your bill is calculated: Standard Azure file shares provide apay-as-you-go model. Premium shares use aprovisioned modelin which you specify and pay for a certain amount of capacity, IOPS, and throughput up front. In the pay-as-you-go model, meters track the amount of data that's stored in the account, or the capacity, and the number and type of transactions based on your usage of that data. The pay-as-you-go model can be cost efficient because you pay only for what you use. With the pay-as-you-go model, you don't need to overprovision or deprovision storage based on performance requirements or demand fluctuations.But you might find it difficult to plan storage as part of a budgeting process because end-user consumption drives cost. With the provisioned model, transactions don't affect billing, so costs are easy to predict. But you pay for the provisioned storage capacity whether you use it or not. For a detailed breakdown of how costs are calculated, seeUnderstand Azure Files billing.

Choose the most cost-effective access tier: Standard SMB Azure file shares offer three access tiers:transaction optimized,hot, andcool. All three tiers are stored on the same standard storage hardware. The main difference for these three tiers is their data at rest storage prices, which are lower in cooler tiers, and the transaction prices, which are higher in cooler tiers. For more information, seeDifferences in standard tiers.

Decide which value-added services you need: Azure Files supports integrations withvalue-added servicessuch as Backup, Azure File Sync, and Defender for Storage. These solutions have their own licensing and product costs but are often considered part of the total cost of ownership for file storage. Considerother cost aspectsif you use Azure File Sync.

Monitor usage: Continuously monitor usage patterns to detect unused or underused storage accounts and file shares. Check for unexpected increases in capacity, which might indicate that you're collecting numerous log files or soft-deleted files. Develop a strategy for deleting files or moving files to more cost-effective access tiers.

Understand your application and usage patterns to achieve predictable performance: Determine latency sensitivity, IOPS and throughput requirements, workload duration and frequency, and workload parallelization. Use Azure Files for multi-threaded applications to help you achieve the upper performance limits of a service. If most of your requests are metadata-centric, such as createfile, openfile, closefile, queryinfo, or querydirectory, the requests create poor latency that's higher than the read and write operations. If you have this problem, consider separating the file share into multiple file shares within the same storage account.

Choose the optimal storage account type: If your workload requires large amounts of IOPS, extremely fast data transfer speeds, or very low latency, then you should choose premium (FileStorage) storage accounts. You can use a standard general-purpose v2 account for most SMB file share workloads. The primary tradeoff between the two storage account types is cost versus performance.The provisioned share size, such as IOPS, egress, and ingress, and single-file limits determine premium share performance. For more information, seeUnderstanding provisioning for premium file shares. Premium file shares also offerburst creditsas an insurance policy if you need to temporarily exceed a premium file share's baseline IOPS limit.

Create storage accounts in the same regions as connecting clients to reduce latency: The farther you are from the Azure Files service, the greater the latency and the more difficult to achieve performance scale limits. This consideration is especially true when you access Azure Files from on-premises environments. If possible, ensure that your storage account and your clients are co-located in the same Azure region. Optimize for on-premises clients by minimizing network latency or by using an ExpressRoute connection to extend on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection.

Optimize for hybrid deployments: If you use Azure File Sync, sync performance depends on many factors: your Windows Server and the underlying disk configuration, network bandwidth between the server and the Azure storage, file size, total dataset size, and the activity on the dataset. To measure the performance of a solution that's based on Azure File Sync, determine the number of objects, such as files and directories, that you process per second.
