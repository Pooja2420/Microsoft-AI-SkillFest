In this quickstart, you set up a new group, assign members to the group, and review its membership. You can use the user and group you create here in other quickstarts and tutorials.
You can view your organization's existing groups and group members using the Microsoft Entra admin center. Groups are used to manage users that all need the same access and permissions for potentially restricted apps and services.
