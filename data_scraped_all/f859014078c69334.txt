Starting3/31/2028, Azure App Service custom backups willno longer support backing up linked databases. SeeDeprecation of linked database backupsfor more information.
InAzure App Service, you can easily restore app backups. You can also make on-demand custom backups or configure scheduled custom backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app or by restoring to a new app or slot. This article shows you how to restore a backup and make custom backups.
Back up and restore is supported in the Basic, Standard, Premium, and Isolated tiers. For the Basic tier, you can only back up and restore the production slot. For more information about scaling your App Service plan to use a higher tier, seeScale up an app in Azure.
Automatic vs. custom backups
There are two types of backups in App Service. If your app is in a supported pricing tier, automatic backups are created regularly. Custom backups require initial configuration and can be made on-demand or on a schedule. The following table shows the differences between the two types.

Back up and restore a linked database
Note
Custom backups with linked databases for App Service support only Single Server tiers of Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL. Since Single Server tiers are being retired, upgrading linked databases to Flexible Server might cause backups to fail. Use native database backup tools to prevent data loss. Standalone MySQL and PostgreSQL servers (for example, on VMs) are unaffected by the Single Server tier retirement. For retirement details, seeMySQL Single Server retirementandPostgreSQL Single Server retirement.
For backup and restore of Flexible Servers, see the respective database documentation:
Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server: Back up and restore
Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server: Back up and restore
Custom backups can include linked databases (except when the backup is configured over Azure Virtual Network). To make sure your backup includes a linked database, take the following steps:
Make sure the linked database issupported.
Create a connection string that points to your database. A database is considered "linked" to your app when there's a valid connection string for it in your app's configuration.
Follow the steps inCreate a custom backupto select the linked database in theAdvancedtab.
To restore a database included in a custom backup:
Follow the steps inRestore a backup.
InAdvanced options, selectInclude database.
For troubleshooting information, seeWhy is my linked database not backed up?.
Deprecation of linked database backups
Starting3/31/2028, Azure App Service custom backups willno longer support backing up linked databases. We recommend using the native backup and restore tools provided by each database service instead.
To help users prepare for this change, the App Service team willremove the option to include linked databasesin new custom backup configurations according to the following schedule:
November 2025â Removal for linkedMySQLandPostgreSQLdatabases
April 2026â Removal for linkedAzure SQLandSQL Serverdatabases
Custom backups that already include linked databases willcontinue to back up those databasesuntil3/31/2028, after which linked databases will no longer be included.
Back up and restore over Azure Virtual Network
Withcustom backups, you can back up your app's files and configuration data to a firewall-protected storage account if the following requirements are met:
The app isintegrated with a virtual network, or the app is in a v3App Service Environment.
The storage accountallows access from the virtual networkthat the app is integrated with, or that the v3 App Service Environment is created with.
To back up and restore over Azure Virtual Network:
When configuringcustom backups, selectBackup/restore over virtual network integration.
SelectConfigureto save your settings.
To enable backup/restore over a virtual network for deployment slots, complete the necessary steps specifically for each slot:
Virtual network integration is enabled for the deployment slots, or the slot is in a v3App Service Environment.
The option for backup/restore over virtual network integration is selected for deployment slots.
If you don't see the checkbox, or if the checkbox is disabled, verify that your resources fulfill the requirements.
After the configuration is saved, any manual backup, scheduled backup, or restore is made through the virtual network. If you make changes to the app, the virtual network, or the storage account that prevent the app from accessing the storage account through the virtual network, the backup or restore operations fail.

Configure partial backups
Partial backups are supported for custom backups but not for automatic backups. Sometimes you don't want to back up everything on your app. Here are a few examples:
Youset up weekly backupsof an app that contains static content that never changes (for example, old blog posts or images).
Your app has over 10 GB of content. (That's the maximum amount you can back up at a time.)
You don't want to back up the log files.
To exclude folders and files from being stored in your future backups, create a_backup.filterfile in the%HOME%\site\wwwrootfolderof your app. Specify the list of files and folders you want to exclude in this file.
_backup.filter
%HOME%\site\wwwroot
Tip
You can access your files by navigating tohttps://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole. If prompted, sign in to your Azure account.
https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole
Identify the folders that you want to exclude from your backups. For example, say you want to filter out the highlighted folder and files.

Create a file called_backup.filterand put the preceding list in the file, but remove the root%HOME%. List one directory or file per line. The content of the file should be:
_backup.filter
%HOME%
\site\wwwroot\Images\brand.png
\site\wwwroot\Images\2014
\site\wwwroot\Images\2013
\site\wwwroot\Images\brand.png
\site\wwwroot\Images\2014
\site\wwwroot\Images\2013
Upload the_backup.filterfile to theD:\home\site\wwwroot\directory of your site by usingFTPor any other method. If you want, you can create the file directly by using KuduDebugConsoleand insert the content there.
_backup.filter
D:\home\site\wwwroot\
DebugConsole
Run backups as normal:custom on-demandorcustom scheduled. Any files and folders that are specified in_backup.filterare excluded from the future backups.
_backup.filter
Note
_backup.filterchanges the way a restore works. Without_backup.filter, restoring a backup deletes all existing files in the app and replaces them with the files in the backup. With_backup.filter, any content in the app's file system included in_backup.filteris left as is (not deleted).
_backup.filter
_backup.filter
_backup.filter
_backup.filter

How backups are stored
After you make one or more backups for your app, the backups are visible on theContainerspage of your storage account and your app. In the storage account, each backup consists of a ZIP file that contains the backup data and an XML file that contains a manifest of the ZIP file contents. You can unzip and browse through these files if you want to access your backups without actually performing an app restore.
The database backup for the app is stored in the root of the .zip file. For SQL Database, this is a BACPAC file (no file extension) and can be imported. To create a database in Azure SQL Database based on the BACPAC export, seeImport a BACPAC file to create a database in Azure SQL Database.
Warning
Altering any of the files in yourwebsitebackupscontainer can cause the backup to become invalid and nonrestorable.

How does backup and restore work with App Service Environments?
Automatic backups can be restored to a target app within the App Service Environment itself, not in another App Service Environment.
Custom backups can be restored to a target app in another App Service Environment, such as from App Service Environment v2 to App Service Environment v3.
Backups can be restored to a target app of the same OS platform as the source app.
Automate with scripts
You can automate backup management with scripts by using theAzure CLIorAzure PowerShell.

Does Azure Functions support automatic backups?
Automatic backups are available for Azure Functions indedicated (App Service)Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers. Automatic backups aren't supported for function apps in theConsumptionorElastic Premiumpricing tiers.
What's included in an automatic backup?
The following table shows which content is backed up in an automatic backup:
%HOME%
/home
The following table shows which app configurations are restored when you choose to restore app configurations:
What's included in a custom backup?
A custom backup (on-demand backup or scheduled backup) includes all content and configuration that's included in anautomatic backup, plus any linked database, up to the allowable maximum size.
Each backup contains a .zip file with backup data and an .xml file {siteName}-{dateTime}.xml, which lists the contents, includingcustom domains. When restoring a custom backup, custom domains from the .xml file will be added to the destination app if no DNS conflict exists (i.e., the domain is available for binding), and if the destination app has different custom domains than the .xml file's custom domain list, those custom domains will be removed.
Whenbacking up over Azure Virtual Network, you can'tback up the linked database.
Why is my linked database not backed up?
Note
Custom backups with linked databases for App Service support only Single Server tiers of Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL. Since Single Server tiers are being retired, upgrading linked databases to Flexible Server might cause backups to fail. Use native database backup tools to prevent data loss. Standalone MySQL and PostgreSQL servers (for example, on VMs) are unaffected by the Single Server tier retirement. For retirement details, seeMySQL Single Server retirementandPostgreSQL Single Server retirement.
For backup and restore of Flexible Servers, see the respective database documentation:
Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server: Back up and restore
Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server: Back up and restore
Linked databases are backed up only for custom backups, up to the allowable maximum size. If the maximum backup size (10 GB) or the maximum database size (4 GB) is exceeded, your backup fails. Here are a few common reasons why your linked database isn't backed up:
Backup ofTLS-enabled Azure Database for MySQLisn't supported. If a backup is configured, you get backup failures.
Backup ofTLS-enabled Azure Database for PostgreSQLisn't supported. If a backup is configured, you get backup failures.
In-app MySQL databases are automatically backed up without any configuration. If you make manual settings for in-app MySQL databases, such as adding connection strings, the backups might not work correctly.
What happens if the backup size exceeds the allowable maximum?
Automatic backups can't be restored if the backup size exceeds the maximum size. Similarly, custom backups fail if the maximum backup size or the maximum database size is exceeded. To reduce your storage size, consider moving files like logs, images, audio, and videos to Azure Storage, for example.
Can I use a storage account that has security features enabled?
You can back up to a firewall-protected storage account if it's part of the same virtual network topology as your app. SeeBack up and restore over Azure Virtual Network.
How do I restore to an app in a different subscription?
Make a custom backup of the source app to an Azure Storage container.
Download the backup ZIP fileand the XML metadata file to your local machine.
Upload both the ZIP and XML files to the target storage account.
In theBackupspage of your target app, clickRestoreon the top menu.
In theBackup detailssection, chooseStorageas theSource. Select thestorage accountwhere you uploaded the backup files.
ClickUse file in storage accountand select theZIP fileto restore.
Configure the remaining settings as outlined inRestore a backup. Confirm and start the restore process.
How do I restore to an app in the same subscription but in a different region?
You can restore an app to a different region within the same subscription. The process follows the same steps outlined inRestore a backup. Ensure that the backup storage for the source app is accessible by the target app. The restoration process in the Azure portal allows selecting an app in a different region as long as it remains within the same subscription.
Where are the automatic backups stored?
Automatic backups are stored in the same datacenter as the App Service. We don't recommend that you rely on automatic backups as your disaster recovery plan.
How do I stop an automatic backup?
You can't stop automatic backups. The automatic backup is stored on the platform and has no effect on the underlying app instance or its storage.
