Run your Azure Machine Learning pipelines as a step in your Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines. The Machine Learning Execute Pipeline activity enables batch prediction scenarios such as identifying possible loan defaults, determining sentiment, and analyzing customer behavior patterns.
The below video features a six-minute introduction and demonstration of this feature.
Create a Machine Learning Execute Pipeline activity with UI
To use a Machine Learning Execute Pipeline activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:
Search forMachine Learningin the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Machine Learning Execute Pipeline activity to the pipeline canvas.
Search forMachine Learningin the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Machine Learning Execute Pipeline activity to the pipeline canvas.
Select the new Machine Learning Execute Pipeline activity on the canvas if it is not already selected, and itsSettingstab, to edit its details.

Select an existing or create a new Azure Machine Learning linked service, and provide details of the pipeline and experiment, and any pipeline parameters or data path assignments required for the pipeline.

Type properties
Note
To populate the dropdown items in Machine Learning pipeline name and ID, the user needs to have permission to list ML pipelines. The UI calls AzureMLService APIs directly using the logged in user's credentials.  The discovery time for the dropdown items would be much longer when using Private Endpoints.
