When you investigate security recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you usually review the list of affected resources. Occasionally, a resource is listed that you feel shouldn't be included. Or a recommendation shows in a scope where you feel it doesn't belong. For example, a resource might be remediated by a process not tracked by Defender for Cloud, or a recommendation might be inappropriate for a specific subscription. Or perhaps your organization decided to accept the risks related to the specific resource or recommendation.
In such cases, you can create an exemption to:
Exempt a resourceto ensure it isn't listed with the unhealthy resources in the future, and doesn't affect your secure score. The resource will be listed as not applicable and the reason will be shown as "exempted" with the specific justification you select.

This relates to existing resources and any you create in the future. The recommendation will be marked with the specific justification you select for the scope that you selected.

For the scope you need, you can create an exemption rule to:
Mark a specificrecommendationas "mitigated" or "risk accepted" for one or more subscriptions, or for an entire management group.

After creating the exemption
After creating the exemption, it can take up to 24 hours to take effect. After it takes effect:
The recommendation or resources won't impact your secure score.
If you exempted specific resources, they'll be listed in theNot applicabletab of the recommendation details page.
If you exempted a recommendation, it will be hidden by default on Defender for Cloud's recommendations page. This is because the default options of theRecommendation statusfilter on that page are to excludeNot applicablerecommendations. The same is true if you exempt all recommendations in a security control.
