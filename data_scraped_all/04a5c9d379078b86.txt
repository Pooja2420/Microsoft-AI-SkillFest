In this quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create anAzure Application Gatewayand test it to make sure it works correctly. You assign listeners to ports, create rules, and add resources to a backend pool. For the sake of simplicity, a simple setup is used with a public frontend IP address, a basic listener to host a single site on the application gateway, a basic request routing rule, and two virtual machines (VMs) in the backend pool.

For more information about the components of an application gateway, seeApplication gateway components.
You can also complete this quickstart usingAzure PowerShellorAzure CLI.
Note
Application Gateway frontend now supports dual-stack IP addresses (Preview). You can now create up to four frontend IP addresses: Two IPv4 addresses (public and private) and two IPv6 addresses (public and private).
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't already have an account, you cancreate an account for free.
Sign in to theAzure portalwith your Azure account.
Create an application gateway
Create the application gateway using the tabs on theCreate application gatewaypage. The Standard v2 SKU is used in this example. To create a Basic SKU using the Azure portal, seeDeploy Application Gateway basic (Preview).
On the Azure portal menu or from theHomepage, selectCreate a resource.
UnderCategories, selectNetworkingand then selectApplication Gatewayin thePopular Azure serviceslist.
Basics tab
On theBasicstab, enter these values for the following application gateway settings:Resource group: SelectmyResourceGroupAGfor the resource group. If it doesn't exist, selectCreate newto create it.Application gateway name: EntermyAppGatewayfor the name of the application gateway.Use the default selections for other settings.

For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, a virtual network is needed. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network at the same time that you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: One for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.NoteVirtual network service endpoint policiesare currently not supported in an Application Gateway subnet.UnderConfigure virtual network, create a new virtual network by selectingCreate new. In theCreate virtual networkwindow that opens, enter the following values to create the virtual network and two subnets:Name: EntermyVNetfor the name of the virtual network.Subnet name(Application Gateway subnet): TheSubnetsgrid shows a subnet nameddefault. Change the name of this subnet tomyAGSubnet.The application gateway subnet can contain only application gateways. No other resources are allowed. The default IP address range provided is 10.0.0.0/24.SelectOKto close theCreate virtual networkwindow and save the virtual network settings.

The backend pool is used to route requests to the backend servers that serve the request. Backend pools can be composed of NICs, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, public IP addresses, internal IP addresses, fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and multitenant backends like Azure App Service. In this example, you'll create an empty backend pool with your application gateway and then add backend targets to the backend pool.
On theBackendstab, selectAdd a backend pool.
On theBackendstab, selectAdd a backend pool.

Review + create tab
Review the settings on theReview + createtab, and then selectCreateto create the virtual network, the public IP address, and the application gateway. It can take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully before moving on to the next section.

Add backend targets
In this example, you'll use virtual machines as the target backend. You can either use existing virtual machines or create new ones. You'll create two virtual machines as backend servers for the application gateway.
To do this, you'll:
Add a backend subnet.
Create two new VMs,myVMandmyVM2, to be used as backend servers.
Install IIS on the virtual machines to verify that the application gateway was created successfully.
Add the backend servers to the backend pool.
Add a backend subnet
The subnetmyAGSubnetcan only contain the application gateway, so we need another subnet to add backend targets.
To create a backend subnet:
Select themyVNetresource. You can select it underDeployment detailsafter deployment of the application gateway is complete, or you can search for Virtual networks and select it from the list.

Test the application gateway
Although IIS isn't required to create the application gateway, you installed it in this quickstart to verify if Azure successfully created the application gateway.
Use IIS to test the application gateway:
Find the public IP address for the application gateway on itsOverviewpage.Or, you can selectAll resources, entermyAGPublicIPAddressin the search box, and then select it in the search results. Azure displays the public IP address on theOverviewpage.

Refresh the browser multiple times and you should see connections to both myVM and myVM2.
Clean up resources
When you no longer need the resources that you created with the application gateway, delete the resource group. When you delete the resource group, you also remove the application gateway and all the related resources.
To delete the resource group:
On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groupsor search for and selectResource groups.
On theResource groupspage, search formyResourceGroupAGin the list, then select it.
On theResource group page, selectDelete resource group.
EntermyResourceGroupAGunderTYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAMEand then selectDelete.
