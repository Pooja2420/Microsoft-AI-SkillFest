Container Insights offers the ability to collect Syslog events from Linux nodes in yourAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS)clusters. This includes the ability to collect logs from control plane components like kubelet. Customers can also use Syslog for monitoring security and health events, typically by ingesting syslog into a SIEM system likeMicrosoft Sentinel.
Prerequisites
Syslog collection needs to be enabled for your cluster using the guidance inConfigure and filter log collection in Container insights.

Port 28330 should be available on the host node.

Ensure hostPort functionality is enabled in the cluster. For example, Cilium Enterprise does not have hostPort functionality enabled by default and prevents the syslog feature from working.

Built-in workbooks
To get a quick snapshot of your syslog data, use the built-in Syslog workbook using one of the following methods:
Note
TheReportstab won't be available if you enable theContainer insights Prometheus experiencefor your cluster.
Reportstab in Container Insights.
Navigate to your cluster in the Azure portal and open theInsights. Open theReportstab and locate theSyslogworkbook.

Grafana dashboard
If you use Grafana, you can use the Syslog dashboard for Grafana to get an overview of your Syslog data. This dashboard is available by default if you create a new Azure-managed Grafana instance. Otherwise, you canimport the Syslog dashboard from the Grafana marketplace.
Note
You need theMonitoring Readerrole on the Subscription containing the Azure Managed Grafana instance to access syslog from Container Insights.

Log queries
Syslog data is stored in theSyslogtable in your Log Analytics workspace. You can create your ownlog queriesinLog Analyticsto analyze this data or use any of theprebuilt queries.

You can open Log Analytics from theLogsmenu in theMonitormenu to access Syslog data for all clusters or from the AKS cluster's menu to access Syslog data for a single cluster.

Sample queries
The following table provides different examples of log queries that retrieve Syslog records.
Syslog
Syslog | where SeverityLevel == "error"
Syslog | summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Computer
Syslog | summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Facility
Syslog | where ProcessName == "kubelet"
Syslog | where ProcessName == "kubelet" and  SeverityLevel == "error"
Next steps
Once setup customers can start sending Syslog data to the tools of their choice
Send Syslog to Microsoft Sentinel
Export data from Log Analytics
