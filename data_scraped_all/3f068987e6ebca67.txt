ManagedIdentityis a policy that controls which managed identities can be used for what purposes. For example, you can configure a policy that allows a specific managed identity to be used for accessing a storage account for ingestion purposes.
This policy can be enabled at the cluster and database levels. The policy is additive, meaning that for every operation that involves a managed identity, the operation will be permitted if the usage is allowed at either the cluster or database level.
