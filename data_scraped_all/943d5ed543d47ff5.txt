As part ofAzure Monitor managed services for Prometheus, you can use Prometheus alert rules to define alert conditions by using queries written in Prometheus Query Language (PromQL). The rule queries are applied on Prometheus metrics stored in anAzure Monitor workspace.
Whenever the alert query results in one or more time series meeting the condition, the alert counts as pending for these metric and label sets. A pending alert becomes active after a user-defined period of time during which all the consecutive query evaluations for the respective time series meet the alert condition. After an alert becomes active, it's fired and triggers your actions or notifications of choice, as defined in the Azure action groups configured in your alert rule.
Create Prometheus alert rules
You create and manage Prometheus alert rules as part of a Prometheus rule group. For details, seeAzure Monitor managed service for Prometheus rule groups.
View Prometheus alerts
You can view fired and resolved Prometheus alerts in the Azure portal together with all other alert types. Use the following steps to filter on only Prometheus alerts:
On theMonitormenu in the Azure portal, selectAlerts.
On theMonitormenu in the Azure portal, selectAlerts.

If your rule group is configured witha specific cluster scope, you can also view alerts fired for this cluster. On theClustermenu in the Azure portal, selectAlerts. You can then filter for the Prometheus monitoring service.
Explore Prometheus alerts in Grafana
On the pane that shows the details of fired alerts, select theView query in Grafanalink.

Grafana opens in Explore mode and presents the chart for your alert rule expression query around the alert firing time. You can further explore the query in Grafana to identify the reason that the alert is firing.

Note
If no Azure Managed Grafana instance is connected to your Azure Monitor workspace, a link to Grafana isn't available.
To view the alert query in Explore mode, you must have either Grafana Admin or Grafana Editor role permissions. If you don't have the needed permissions, you get a Grafana error.
