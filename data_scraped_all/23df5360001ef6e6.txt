DR for Azure Data Platform - Scenario details
Data service topology
At a high-level the data service topology for Contoso's data platform can be illustrated as:This logical diagram abstracts the key functions of the Contoso data ecosystem into a simplified, high-level view. This abstracted view supports the sections covering the scenario deployments, in line with the disaster recovery (DR) strategy selection and the segregation of responsibilities in a service recovery process.
DR impact vs customer activity
The following sections present a breakdown of Contoso activity necessary across DR events of varying impacts.

Azure regional failure: Contoso would need to deploy an instance of Microsoft Purview into the secondary region.
NotesThis activity would be mitigated by implementing the "Warm Spare" strategy, having a second instance of Azure Microsoft Purview available in the secondary regionA "Warm Spare" approach has the followingkey callouts:The primary and secondary Azure Microsoft Purview accounts can't be configured to the same Azure data factory, Azure Data Share and Azure Synapse Analytics accounts, if applicable. As a result, the lineage from Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Share can't be seen in the secondary Azure Microsoft Purview accounts.The integration runtimes are specific to an Azure Microsoft Purview account. Hence, if scans must run in primary and secondary Azure Microsoft Purview accounts in parallel, multiple self-hosted integration runtimes must be maintained.

Note
This section is intended as general guidance. The vendor's documentation on disaster recovery, redundancy and backup should be consulted for the correct approach for a new component or service under consideration.
"Azure datacenter failure" covers the situation where the affected region does not haveAvailability Zonesoffered.
If new/updated configuration or releases occurred at the point of the disaster event, these should be checked and redeployed (if necessary) as part of the work to bring the platform up to the current date.
