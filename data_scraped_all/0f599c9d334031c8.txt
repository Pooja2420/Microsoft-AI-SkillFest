The Azure Stream Analytics service makes it easy to ingest, process, and analyze streaming data from Azure Event Hubs, enabling powerful insights to drive real-time actions. You can use the Azure portal to visualize incoming data and write a Stream Analytics query. Once your query is ready, you can move it into production in only a few clicks.
Key benefits
Here are the key benefits of Azure Event Hubs and Azure Stream Analytics integration:
Preview dataâ You can preview incoming data from an event hub in the Azure portal.
Test your queryâ Prepare a transformation query and test it directly in the Azure portal. For the query language syntax, seeStream Analytics Query Languagedocumentation.
Deploy your query to productionâ You can deploy the query into production by creating and starting an Azure Stream Analytics job.
End-to-end flow
Important
If you aren't a member ofownerorcontributorroles at the Azure subscription level, you must be a member of theStream Analytics Query Testerrole at the Azure subscription level to successfully complete steps in this section. This role allows you to perform testing queries without creating a stream analytics job first. For instructions on assigning a role to a user, seeAssign AD roles to users.
If your event hub allows only the private access via private endpoints, you must have the Stream Analytics job joined to the same network so that the job can access events in the event hub.

Consumer groups allow only five concurrent readers, so providing a dedicated consumer group for each job will avoid any errors that might arise from exceeding that limit. A dedicated policy allows you to rotate your key or revoke permissions without impacting other resources.

Access
Issue: User can't access preview data because they donât have right permissions on the Subscription.
Option 1: The user who wants to preview incoming data needs to be added as a Contributor on Subscription.
Option 2: The user needs to be added as Stream Analytics Query tester role on Subscription. Navigate to Access control for the subscription. Add a new role assignment for the user as "Stream Analytics Query Tester" role.
Option 3: The user can create Azure Stream Analytics job. Set input as this event hub and navigate to "Query" to preview incoming data from this event hub.
Option 4: The admin can create a custom role on the subscription. Add the following permissions to the custom role and then add user to the new custom role.

Streaming units
Your Azure Stream Analytics job defaults to three streaming units (SUs). To adjust this setting, selectScaleon the left menu in theStream Analytics jobpage in the Azure portal. To learn more about streaming units, seeUnderstand and adjust Streaming Units.

Considerations when using the Event Hubs Geo-replication feature
Azure Event Hubs recently launched theGeo-Replicationfeature in public preview. This feature is different from theGeo Disaster Recoveryfeature of Azure Event Hubs.
When the failover type isForcedand replication consistency isAsynchronous, Stream Analytics job doesn't guarantee exactly once output to an Azure Event Hubs output.
Azure Stream Analytics, asproducerwith an event hub an output, might observe watermark delay on the job during failover duration and during throttling by Event Hubs in case replication lag  between primary and secondary reaches the maximum configured lag.
Azure Stream Analytics, asconsumerwith Event Hubs as Input, might observe watermark delay on the job during failover duration and might skip data or find duplicate data after failover is complete.
Due to these caveats, we recommend that you restart the Stream Analytics job with appropriate start time right after Event Hubs failover is complete. Also, since Event Hubs Geo-replication feature is in public preview, we don't recommend using this pattern for production Stream Analytics jobs at this point. The current Stream Analytics behavior will improve before the Event Hubs Geo-replication feature is generally available and can be used in Stream Analytics production jobs.
