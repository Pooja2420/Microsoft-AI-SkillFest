Azure NAT Gateway is a fully managed and highly resilient Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use Azure NAT Gateway to let all instances in a private subnet  connect outbound to the internet while remaining fully private. Unsolicited inbound connections from the internet aren't permitted through a NAT gateway. Only packets arriving as response packets to an outbound connection can pass through a NAT gateway.
NAT Gateway provides dynamic SNAT port functionality to automatically scale outbound connectivity and reduce the risk of SNAT port exhaustion.

Azure NAT Gateway benefits
Simple Setup
Deployments are intentionally made simple with NAT gateway. Attach NAT gateway to a subnet and public IP address and start connecting outbound to the internet right away. There's zero maintenance and routing configurations required. More public IPs or subnets can be added later without effect to your existing configuration.
The following steps are an example of how to set up a NAT gateway:
Create a nonzonal or zonal NAT gateway.

If necessary, modify Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) idle timeout (optional). Reviewtimersbefore you change the default.
Security
NAT Gateway is built on the zero trust network security model and is secure by default. With NAT gateway, private instances within a subnet don't need public IP addresses to reach the internet. Private resources can reach external sources outside the virtual network by source network address translating (SNAT) to NAT gateway's static public IP addresses or prefixes. You can provide a contiguous set of IPs for outbound connectivity by using a public IP prefix. Destination firewall rules can be configured based on this predictable IP list.
Resiliency
Azure NAT Gateway is a fully managed and distributed service. It doesn't depend on individual compute instances such as VMs or a single physical gateway device. A NAT gateway always has multiple fault domains and can sustain multiple failures without service outage. Software defined networking makes a NAT gateway highly resilient.
Scalability
NAT gateway is scaled out from creation. There isn't a ramp up or scale-out operation required. Azure manages the operation of NAT gateway for you.
Attach NAT gateway to a subnet to provide outbound connectivity for all private resources in that subnet. All subnets in a virtual network can use the same NAT gateway resource. Outbound connectivity can be scaled out by assigning up to 16 public IP addresses or a /28 size public IP prefix to NAT gateway. When a NAT gateway is associated to a public IP prefix, it automatically scales to the number of IP addresses needed for outbound.
Performance
Azure NAT Gateway is a software defined networking service. Each NAT gateway can process up to 50 Gbps of data for both outbound and return traffic.
A NAT gateway doesn't affect the network bandwidth of your compute resources. Learn more aboutNAT gateway's performance.

Outbound connectivity
NAT gateway is the recommended method for outbound connectivity.To migrate outbound access to a NAT gateway from default outbound access or load balancer outbound rules, seeMigrate outbound access to Azure NAT Gateway.

Note
On September 30th, 2025,default outbound accessfor new deployments will be retired. It is recommended to use an explicit form of outbound connectivity instead, like NAT gateway.
Egress is defined at a per subnet level with NAT gateway. NAT gateway replaces the default Internet destination of a subnet.

NAT gateway allows flows to be created from the virtual network to the services outside your virtual network. Return traffic from the internet is only allowed in response to an active flow. Services outside your virtual network canât initiate an inbound connection through NAT gateway.

NAT gateway takes precedence over other outbound connectivity methods, including a load balancer, instance-level public IP addresses, and Azure Firewall.

When NAT gateway is configured to a virtual network where a different outbound connectivity method already exists, NAT gateway takes over all outbound traffic moving forward. There are no drops in traffic flow for existing connections on Azure Load Balancer. All new connections use NAT gateway.

Traffic routes
The subnet has asystem default routethat routes traffic with destination 0.0.0.0/0 to the internet automatically. Once NAT gateway is configured to the subnet, communication from the virtual machines existing in the subnet to the internet will prioritize using the public IP of the NAT gateway.

When you create a user defined route (UDR) in your subnet route table for 0.0.0.0/0 traffic, the default internet path for this traffic is overridden. A UDR that sends 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to a virtual appliance or a virtual network gateway (VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute) as the next hop type instead override NAT gateway connectivity to the internet.

Outbound connectivity follows this order of precedence among different routing and outbound connectivity methods:UDR to next hop Virtual appliance or virtual network gateway >> NAT gateway >> Instance-level public IP address on a virtual machine >> Load balancer outbound rules >> default system route to the internet.

Connection timeouts and timers
NAT gateway sends a TCP Reset (RST) packet for any connection flow that it doesn't recognize as an existing connection. The connection flow no longer exists if the NAT gateway idle timeout was reached or the connection was closed earlier.
