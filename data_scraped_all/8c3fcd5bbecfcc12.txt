Tutorial: Configure priority traffic routing method in Traffic Manager

This tutorial describes how to use Azure Traffic Manager to route user traffic to specific endpoints by using the priority routing method. In this routing method, you'll define the order of each endpoint that goes into Traffic Manager profile configuration. Traffic from users will be routed to the endpoint in the order they're listed. This method of routing is useful when you want to configure for service failover. The primary endpoint gets a priority number of '1' and will service all incoming requests. While endpoints of lower priority will act as backups.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a Traffic Manager profile with priority routing.
Add endpoints.
Configure priority of endpoints.
Use the Traffic Manager profile.
Delete Traffic Manager profile.

In the Create Traffic Manager profile page, define the following settings:SettingValueNameProvide a name for your profile. This name needs to be unique within the trafficmanager.net zone. To access your Traffic Manager profile, you use the DNS name<profilename>.trafficmanager.net.Routing methodSelectPriority.SubscriptionSelect your subscription.Resource groupUse an existing resource group or create a new resource group to place this profile under. If you choose to create a new resource group, use theResource Group locationdropdown to specify the location of the resource group. This setting refers to the location of the resource group, and has no impact on the Traffic Manager profile that's deployed globally.
In the Create Traffic Manager profile page, define the following settings:

On theEndpointspage, review the priority order for your endpoints. When you select thePrioritytraffic routing method, the order of the selected endpoints matters. Verify the priority order of endpoints.  The primary endpoint is on top. Double-check on the order it's displayed. All requests will be routed to the first endpoint and if Traffic Manager detects it 's unhealthy, the traffic automatically fails over to the next endpoint.

Use the Traffic Manager profile
In the portalâs search bar, search for theTraffic Manager profilename that you created in the preceding section and select on the traffic manager profile in the results that the displayed.

TheTraffic Manager profileoverview page displays the DNS name of your newly created Traffic Manager profile. This can be used by any clients (for example, by navigating to it using a web browser) to get routed to the right endpoint as determined by the routing type. In this case, all requests get routed to the first endpoint and if Traffic Manager detects it 's unhealthy, the traffic automatically fails over to the next endpoint.

Once your Traffic Manager profile is working, edit the DNS record on your authoritative DNS server to point your company domain name to the Traffic Manager domain name.
