Firewall health state
In the preceding table, theFirewall health statemetric has two dimensions:
Status: Possible values areHealthy,Degraded,Unhealthy.
Reason: Indicates the reason for the corresponding status of the firewall.
If SNAT ports are used more than 95%, they're considered exhausted and the health is 50% with status=Degradedand reason=SNAT port. The firewall keeps processing traffic and existing connections aren't affected. However, new connections might not be established intermittently.
If SNAT ports are used less than 95%, then firewall is considered healthy and health is shown as 100%.
If no SNAT ports usage is reported, health is shown as 0%.
For theSNAT port utilizationmetric, when you add more public IP addresses to your firewall, more SNAT ports are available, reducing the SNAT ports utilization. Additionally, when the firewall scales out for different reasons (for example, CPU or throughput) more SNAT ports also become available.
Effectively, a given percentage of SNAT ports utilization might go down without you adding any public IP addresses, just because the service scaled out. You can directly control the number of public IP addresses available to increase the ports available on your firewall. But, you can't directly control firewall scaling.
If your firewall is running into SNAT port exhaustion, you should add at least five public IP address. This increases the number of SNAT ports available. For more information, seeAzure Firewall features.
TheAZFW Latency Probemetric measures the overall or average latency of Azure Firewall in milliseconds. Administrators can use this metric for the following purposes:
Diagnose if Azure Firewall is the cause of latency in the network
Monitor and alert if there are any latency or performance issues, so IT teams can proactively engage.
There might be various reasons that can cause high latency in Azure Firewall. For example, high CPU utilization, high throughput, or a possible networking issue.
What the AZFW Latency Probe Metric Measures (and Doesn't):
What it measures: The latency of the Azure Firewall within the Azure platform
What it doesn't measure: The metric does not capture end-to-end latency for the entire network path. Instead, it reflects the performance within the firewall, rather than how much latency Azure Firewall introduces into the network.
Error reporting: If the latency metric isn't functioning correct, it reports a value of 0 in the metrics dashboard, indicating a probe failure or interruption.
Factors that impact latency:
High CPU utilization
High throughput or traffic load
Networking issues within the Azure platform
Latency Probes: From ICMP to TCPThe latency probe currently uses Microsoft's Ping Mesh technology, which is based on ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). ICMP is suitable for quick health checks, like ping requests, but it may not accurately represent real-world application traffic, which typically relis on TCP.However, ICMP probes prioritize differently across the Azure platform, which can result in variation across SKUs. To reduce these discrepancies, Azure Firewall plans to transition to TCP-based probes.
Latency spikes: With ICMP probes, intermittent spikes are normal and are part of the host network's standard behavior. These should not be misinterpreted as firewall issues unless they are persistent.
Average latency: On average, the latency of Azure Firewall is expected to range from 1ms to 10 ms, depending on the Firewall SKU and deployment size.
Best Practices for Monitoring Latency
Set a baseline: Establish a latency baseline under light traffic conditions for accurate comparisons during normal or peak usage.
Set a baseline: Establish a latency baseline under light traffic conditions for accurate comparisons during normal or peak usage.
Monitor for patterns: Expect occasional latency spikes as part of normal operations. If high latency persists beyond these normal variations, it may indicate a deeper issue requiring investigation.
Monitor for patterns: Expect occasional latency spikes as part of normal operations. If high latency persists beyond these normal variations, it may indicate a deeper issue requiring investigation.
Recommended latency threshold: A recommended guideline is that latency should not exceed 3x the baseline. If this threshold is crossed, further investigation is recommended.

Azure Firewall has two new diagnostic logs that can help monitor your firewall, but these logs currently do not show application rule details.
Top flows
Flow trace
Top flows
The top flows log is known in the industry asfat flow logand in the preceding table asAzure Firewall Fat Flow Log. The top flows log shows the top connections that are contributing to the highest throughput through the firewall.
Tip
Activate Top flows logs only when troubleshooting a specific issue to avoid excessive CPU usage of Azure Firewall.
The flow rate is defined as the data transmission rate in megabits per second units. It's a measure of the amount of digital data that can be transmitted over a network in a period of time through the firewall. The Top Flows protocol runs periodically every three minutes. The minimum threshold to be considered a Top Flow is 1 Mbps.
Enable the Top flows log using the following Azure PowerShell commands:
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName <SubscriptionName>
$firewall = Get-AzFirewall -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <FirewallName>
$firewall.EnableFatFlowLogging = $true
Set-AzFirewall -AzureFirewall $firewall
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName <SubscriptionName>
$firewall = Get-AzFirewall -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <FirewallName>
$firewall.EnableFatFlowLogging = $true
Set-AzFirewall -AzureFirewall $firewall
To disable the logs, use the same previous Azure PowerShell command and set the value toFalse.
For example:
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName <SubscriptionName>
$firewall = Get-AzFirewall -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <FirewallName>
$firewall.EnableFatFlowLogging = $false
Set-AzFirewall -AzureFirewall $firewall
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName <SubscriptionName>
$firewall = Get-AzFirewall -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <FirewallName>
$firewall.EnableFatFlowLogging = $false
Set-AzFirewall -AzureFirewall $firewall
There are a few ways to verify the update was successful, but you can navigate to firewallOverviewand selectJSON viewon the top right corner. Hereâs an example:

To create a diagnostic setting and enable Resource Specific Table, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
Flow trace
The firewall logs show traffic through the firewall in the first attempt of a TCP connection, known as theSYNpacket. However, such an entry doesn't show the full journey of the packet in the TCP handshake. As a result, it's difficult to troubleshoot if a packet is dropped, or asymmetric routing occurred. The Azure Firewall Flow Trace Log addresses this concern.
Tip
To avoid excessive disk usage caused by Flow trace logs in Azure Firewall with many short-lived connections, activate the logs only when troubleshooting a specific issue for diagnostic purposes.
The following properties can be added:
SYN-ACK: ACK flag that indicates acknowledgment of SYN packet.
SYN-ACK: ACK flag that indicates acknowledgment of SYN packet.
FIN: Finished flag of the original packet flow. No more data is transmitted in the TCP flow.
FIN: Finished flag of the original packet flow. No more data is transmitted in the TCP flow.
FIN-ACK: ACK flag that indicates acknowledgment of FIN packet.
FIN-ACK: ACK flag that indicates acknowledgment of FIN packet.
RST: The Reset the flag indicates the original sender doesn't receive more data.
RST: The Reset the flag indicates the original sender doesn't receive more data.
INVALID (flows): Indicates packet canât be identified or don't have any state.For example:A TCP packet lands on a Virtual Machine Scale Sets instance, which doesn't have any prior history for this packetBad CheckSum packetsConnection Tracking table entry is full and new connections can't be acceptedOverly delayed ACK packets

Overly delayed ACK packets
Enable the Flow trace log using the following Azure PowerShell commands or navigate in the portal and search forEnable TCP Connection Logging:
Connect-AzAccount 
Select-AzSubscription -Subscription <subscription_id> or <subscription_name>
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AFWEnableTcpConnectionLogging -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Connect-AzAccount 
Select-AzSubscription -Subscription <subscription_id> or <subscription_name>
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AFWEnableTcpConnectionLogging -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
It can take several minutes for this change to take effect. Once the feature is registered, consider performing an update on Azure Firewall for the change to take effect immediately.
To check the status of the AzResourceProvider registration, you can run the Azure PowerShell command:
Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "AFWEnableTcpConnectionLogging" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Network"
Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "AFWEnableTcpConnectionLogging" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Network"
To disable the log, you can unregister it using the following command or select unregister in the previous portal example.
Unregister-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AFWEnableTcpConnectionLogging -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Unregister-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AFWEnableTcpConnectionLogging -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
