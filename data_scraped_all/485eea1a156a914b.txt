Filter inbound Internet or intranet traffic with Azure Firewall DNAT using the Azure portal

You can configure Azure Firewall Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) to translate and filter inbound Internet traffic to your subnets or intranet traffic between private networks (preview). When you configure DNAT, the NAT rule collection action is set toDNAT. Each rule in the NAT rule collection can then be used to translate your firewall's public or private IP address and port to a private IP address and port. DNAT rules implicitly add a corresponding network rule to allow the translated traffic. For security reasons, it's recommended to add a specific source to allow DNAT access to the network and avoid using wildcards. To learn more about Azure Firewall rule processing logic, seeAzure Firewall rule processing logic.
Note
This article uses classic Firewall rules to manage the firewall. The preferred method is to useFirewall Policy. To complete this procedure using Firewall Policy, seeTutorial: Filter inbound Internet traffic with Azure Firewall policy DNAT using the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create a resource group
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the Azure portal home page, selectResource groups, then selectCreate.
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource group, typeRG-DNAT-Test.
ForRegion, select a region. All other resources that you create must be in the same region.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Set up the network environment
For this article, you create two peered VNets:
VN-Hub- the firewall is in this virtual network.
VN-Spoke- the workload server is in this virtual network.
First, create the VNets and then peer them.
Create the Hub virtual network
From the Azure portal home page, selectAll services.
UnderNetworking, selectVirtual networks.
SelectCreate.
ForResource group, selectRG-DNAT-Test.
ForName, typeVN-Hub.
ForRegion, select the same region that you used before.
SelectNext.
On theSecuritytab, selectNext.
ForIPv4 Address space, accept the default10.0.0.0/16.
UnderSubnets, selectdefault.
ForSubnet template, selectAzure Firewall.
The firewall is in this subnet, and the subnet namemustbe AzureFirewallSubnet.
Note
The size of the AzureFirewallSubnet subnet is /26. For more information about the subnet size, seeAzure Firewall FAQ.
SelectSave.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Create a spoke virtual network
From the Azure portal home page, selectAll services.
UnderNetworking, selectVirtual networks.
SelectCreate.
ForResource group, selectRG-DNAT-Test.
ForName, typeVN-Spoke.
ForRegion, select the same region that you used before.
SelectNext.
On theSecuritytab, selectNext.
ForIPv4 Address space, edit the default and type192.168.0.0/16.
UnderSubnets, selectdefault.
For the subnetName, typeSN-Workload.
ForStarting address, type192.168.1.0.
ForSubnet size, select/24.
SelectSave.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Peer the VNets
Now peer the two VNets.
Select theVN-Hubvirtual network.
UnderSettings, selectPeerings.
SelectAdd.
UnderThis virtual network, for thePeering link name, typePeer-HubSpoke.
UnderRemote virtual network, forPeering link name, typePeer-SpokeHub.
SelectVN-Spokefor the virtual network.
Accept all the other defaults, and then selectAdd.
Create a virtual machine
Create a workload virtual machine, and place it in theSN-Workloadsubnet.
From the Azure portal menu, selectCreate a resource.
UnderPopular Marketplace products, selectWindows Server 2019 Datacenter.
Basics
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource group, selectRG-DNAT-Test.
ForVirtual machine name, typeSrv-Workload.
ForRegion, select the same location that you used previously.
Type a username and password.
SelectNext: Disks.
Disks
SelectNext: Networking.
Networking
ForVirtual network, selectVN-Spoke.
ForSubnet, selectSN-Workload.
ForPublic IP, selectNone.
ForPublic inbound ports, selectNone.
Leave the other default settings and selectNext: Management.
Management
SelectNext: Monitoring.
Monitoring
ForBoot diagnostics, selectDisable.
SelectReview + Create.
Review + Create
Review the summary, and then selectCreate. This process takes a few minutes to complete.
After the deployment finishes, note the private IP address of the virtual machine. You need this IP address later when configuring the firewall. Select the virtual machine name, go toOverview, and underNetworking, note the private IP address.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Deploy the firewall

After deployment completes, go to theRG-DNAT-Testresource group and select theFW-DNAT-testfirewall.
After deployment completes, go to theRG-DNAT-Testresource group and select theFW-DNAT-testfirewall.
Note the firewall's private and public IP addresses. You use them later when creating the default route and NAT rule.

Create a default route
For theSN-Workloadsubnet, configure the outbound default route to go through the firewall.
Important
You don't need to configure an explicit route back to the firewall at the destination subnet. Azure Firewall is a stateful service and handles the packets and sessions automatically. Creating this route would result in an asymmetrical routing environment, interrupting the stateful session logic and causing dropped packets and connections.
