This article summarizes support and prerequisites when you move virtual machines and related network resources across Azure regions using Resource Mover.
Windows VM support
Resource Mover supports Azure VMs running these Windows operating systems.
Note
Windows Trusted Launch VMs are supported by Resource Mover.
Linux VM support
Resource Mover supports Azure VMs running these Linux operating systems.
Note
Linux Trusted Launch VMs aren't supported by Resource Mover.
Supported Ubuntu kernel versions
Supported Debian kernel versions
Supported SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 kernel versions
Supported SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 kernel versions
Supported Linux file system/guest storage
File systems: ext3, ext4, XFS, BTRFS
Volume manager: LVM2
Multipath software: Device Mapper
Supported VM compute settings
Supported VM storage settings
This table summarized support for the Azure VM OS disk, data disk, and temporary disk. It's important to observe the VM disk limits and targets formanaged disksto avoid any performance issues.
Note
The target VM size should be equal to or larger than the source VM. The parameters used for validation are: Data Disks Count, NICs count, Available CPUs, Memory in GB. If it isn't, an error is issued.
Limits and data change rates
The following table summarizes limits that based on our tests. These  don't cover all possible application I/O combinations. Actual results vary based on your application I/O mix. There are two limits to consider, per disk data churn, and per VM data churn.
Supported VM networking settings
Outbound access requirements
Azure VMs that you want to move need outbound access.
URL access
If you're using a URL-based firewall proxy to control outbound connectivity, allow access to these URLs:
*.blob.core.windows.net
login.microsoftonline.com
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com
*.servicebus.windows.net
NSG rules
If you're using a network security group (NSG) rules to control outbound connectivity, create theseservice tagrules. Each rule should allow outbound access on HTTPS (443).
Create a Storage tag rule for the source region.
Create anAzureSiteRecoverytag rule, to allow access to the Site Recovery service in any region. This tag has dependencies on these other tags, so you need to create rules for them to:AzureActiveDirectory*EventHubAzureKeyVaultGuestAndHybridManagement
AzureActiveDirectory
*EventHub
AzureKeyVault
GuestAndHybridManagement
We recommend you test rules in a non-production environment.Review some examples.
