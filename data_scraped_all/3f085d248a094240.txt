APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
Use thevalidate-client-certificatepolicy to enforce that a certificate presented by a client to an API Management instance matches specified validation rules and claims such as subject or issuer for one or more certificate identities.
validate-client-certificate
To be considered valid, a client certificate must match all the validation rules defined by the attributes at the top-level element and match all defined claims for at least one of the defined identities.
Use this policy to check incoming certificate properties against desired properties. Also use this policy to override default validation of client certificates in these cases:
If you have uploaded custom CA certificates to validate client requests to the managed gateway
If you configured custom certificate authorities to validate client requests to a self-managed gateway
For more information about custom CA certificates and certificate authorities, seeHow to add a custom CA certificate in Azure API Management.
Note
Set the policy's elements and child elements in the order provided in the policy statement. Learn more abouthow to set or edit API Management policies.

Usage notes
You must use double quotes to enclose values of name attributes in thesubjectandissuer-subjectattributes when they contain certain special characters such as ",". For example, specifyO="Contoso, Inc."instead ofO=Contoso, Inc.for the organization name.Learn more
subject
issuer-subject
O="Contoso, Inc."
O=Contoso, Inc.
Example
The following example validates a client certificate to match the policy's default validation rules and checks whether the subject and issuer name match specified values.
<validate-client-certificate 
    validate-revocation="true" 
    validate-trust="true" 
    validate-not-before="true" 
    validate-not-after="true" 
    ignore-error="false">
    <identities>
        <identity
            subject="C=US, ST=Illinois, L=Chicago, O="Contoso, Inc.", CN=*.contoso.com"
            issuer-subject="C=BE, O=FabrikamSign nv-sa, OU=Root CA, CN=FabrikamSign Root CA" />
