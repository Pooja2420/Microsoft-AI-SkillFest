Basic Load balancer deprecation: Guidelines for Azure HDInsight

This article describes the details about the impact on HDInsight clusters and the necessary steps required as HDInsight service is transitioning to use standard load balancers for all its cluster configurations.
This transition is done in line with the announcement of retirement of Azure basic load balancer by 30 September 2025 and no support for new deployment by Mar 31, 2025. For more information, seeAzure Basic Load Balancer retires on 30 September 2025. Upgrade to Standard Load Balancer.
As part of the migration from the basic load balancer to the standard load balancer, the public IP address will be upgraded from basic SKU to standard SKU. For more details, seeUpgrade to Standard SKU public IP addresses in Azure by 30 September 2025 - Basic SKU will be retired. Additionally, default outbound access will be deprecated. For further information, seeDefault outbound access for VMs in Azure will be retired - transition to a new method of internet access.
Note
Please be advised not to alter any components created by HDInsight within your VNet, including load balancers, IP addresses, network interfaces, etc. Any modifications you make to these components may be reverted during cluster maintenance.
Impact on HDInsight clusters
Long running clusters (when you donât create and delete cluster frequently for your use case)
Scenario 1:Existing HDInsight clusters without custom virtual network (No virtual network used during cluster creation).No immediate disruption until Mar 31, 2025. However, we strongly recommend re-creating the cluster before Mar 31, 2025 to avoid potential disruption.

New cluster creation
Due to the deprecation of the default outbound access, a new outbound connectivity method is required by the HDInsight cluster. There are several ways provided in the documentSource Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connectionsthat could provide outbound connectivity for a cluster. The most recommended way with HDInsight is to associate a NAT gateway to the subnet, which supports auto-scaling features of HDInsight clusters.
NAT gateway provides outbound network connectivity for the cluster. NSG controls both the inbound and outbound traffic, which is required by the standard load balancer.
Note
If you prefer Azure Firewall instead of NAT gateway, followConfigure outbound network traffic restrictionand then create the cluster.
Scenario 1:HDInsight clusters without custom virtual network (Creating cluster without any virtual network).In this case, no impact. You can recreate the cluster directly.

Important
If you experience job slowness or network issues after cluster recreation with a standard load balancer, check the "Total SNAT Connection Count" and "Dropped Packets" on your NAT Gateway. High values may indicate SNAT port exhaustion. To address this, consider implementing one of the following methods:Bind additional IP addresses or IP prefixes to your NAT Gateway. For more information, seeTroubleshoot Azure NAT Gateway connectivityandMetrics and alerts for Azure NAT Gateway.Enable private link to storage accounts which could reduce SNAT port dependency. For more information, seeUse private endpoints for Azure Storage.

Note
If you are using an ESP cluster with MFA disabled, ensure to check the MFA status once cluster is recreated using a NAT gateway.
