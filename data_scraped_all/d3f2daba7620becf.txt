It's important to correctly configure your DNS settings to resolve the private endpoint IP address to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the connection string.
Existing Microsoft Azure services might already have a DNS configuration for a public endpoint. This configuration must be overridden to connect using your private endpoint.
The network interface associated with the private endpoint contains the information to configure your DNS. The network interface information includes FQDN and private IP addresses for your private link resource.
You can use the following options to configure your DNS settings for private endpoints:
Use the host file (only recommended for testing). You can use the host file on a virtual machine to override the DNS.

Caution
It's not recommended to override a zone that's actively in use to resolve public endpoints. Connections to resources won't be able to resolve correctly without DNS forwarding to the public DNS. To avoid issues, create a different domain name or follow the suggested name for each service listed later in this article.

Existing Private DNS Zones linked to a single Azure service should not be associated with two different Azure service Private Endpoints. This will cause a deletion of the initial A-record and result in resolution issue when attempting to access that service from each respective Private Endpoint. Create a DNS zone for each Private Endpoint of like services. Don't place records for multiple services in the same DNS zone.

Azure services DNS zone configuration
Azure creates a canonical name DNS record (CNAME) on the public DNS. The CNAME record redirects the resolution to the private domain name. You can override the resolution with the private IP address of your private endpoints.
Connection URLs for your existing applications don't change. Client DNS requests to a public DNS server resolve to your private endpoints. The process doesn't affect your existing applications.
Important
Azure File Shares must be remounted if connected to the public endpoint.
Caution
Private networks using a Private DNS Zone for any given resource type (for example, privatelink.blob.core.windows.net/Storage Account) can only resolve DNS Queries to public resources/Public IPs if those public resources don't have any existing Private Endpoint Connections. If this applies, an additional DNS configuration is required on the Private DNS Zone to complete the DNS resolution sequence. Otherwise, the Private DNS Zone will respond to the DNS query with a NXDOMAIN as no matching DNS record would be found in the Private DNS Zone.
Fallback to Internetfor Private DNS Zone Virtual Network Links can be implemented for proper DNS Resolution for the Public IP of the public resource. This allows DNS queries that reach Private DNS Zones to be forwarded to Azure DNS for public resolution.
Alternatively, a manually entered A-record in the Private DNS Zone that contains the Public IP of the public resource would allow for proper DNS resolution. This procedure isn't recommended as the Public IP of the A record in the Private DNS Zone won't be automatically updated if the corresponding public IP address changes for the public resource.
Private endpoint private DNS zone configurations will only automatically generate if you use the recommended naming scheme in the following tables.
For Azure services, use the recommended zone names as described in the following tables:

2In scenarios where the Kudu console or Kudu REST API is used, you must create two DNS records pointing to the private endpoint IP in your Azure DNS private zone or custom DNS server. The first record is for your app, and the second record is for the SCM (Source Control Management) of your app.
