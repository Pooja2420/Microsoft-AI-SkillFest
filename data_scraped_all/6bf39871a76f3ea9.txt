On March 31, 2025, Microsoft Azure will retire the Standard_NC24rs_v3 virtual machine (VM) size in NCv3-series virtual machines (VMs). To avoid any disruption to your service, we recommend that you change the VM sizing from the Standard_NC24rs_v3 to the newer VM series in the same NC product line.
Microsoft recommends the AzureNC A100 v4-seriesVMs, which offer greater GPU memory bandwidth per GPU, improvedAccelerated Networkingcapabilities, larger and faster local solid state drives. Overall the NC A100 v4-series deliversbetter cost performanceacross midrange AI training and inference workloads.
Depending on the workload being run and regional affinity, Standard_NC24rs_v3 may also be replaced by NVadsA10_v5, NCads_H100_v5, or NCasT4_v3.
How does the retirement of the Standard_NC24rs_v3 affect me?
After March 31, 2025, any remaining Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM subscriptions will be set to a deallocated state. They'll stop working and no longer incur billing charges. The Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM size will no longer be under SLA or have support included.
Note: This retirement only impacts the virtual machine sizes in the Standard_NC24rs_v3 size in NCv3-series powered by NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Seeretirement guide for Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3, and Standard_NC24s_v3. This retirement announcement doesn't apply to NCasT4 v3, and NC A100 v4 and NCads H100 v5 series virtual machines.
What action do I need to take before the retirement date?
You need to resize or deallocate your Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM size. We recommend that you change VM sizes for these workloads, from the original Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM size to the Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4 size (or an alternative).
The Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4 VM size inNC A100 v4 seriesis powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and third generation AMD EPYCâ¢ 7V13 (Milan) processors. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80 GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. CheckAzure Regions by Product pagefor region availability. Visit theAzure Virtual Machine pricing pagefor pricing information.
TheNCads H100 v5-Seriesis another SKU in the same product line powered by NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU. These VMs are targeted for GPU accelerated midrange AI training, batch inferencing, and high performance computing simulation workloads.
Steps to change VM size
Choose a series and size. Refer to the above tables for Microsoftâs recommendation. You can also file a support request if more assistance is needed.
