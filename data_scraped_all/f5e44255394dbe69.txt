Azure Backup supports the backup of SAP HANA databases to Azure. This article summarizes the scenarios supported and limitations present when you use Azure Backup to back up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs.
Note
The frequency of log backup can now be set to a minimum of 15 minutes. Log backups only begin to flow after a successful full backup for the database has completed.
Scenario support
ext3
xfs
Note
Azure Backup doesnât automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes when backing up an SAP HANA database running in an Azure VM. We recommend you to modify the policy manually as needed.
You can nowmonitor the backup and restorejobs (to the same machine) triggered from HANA native clients (SAP HANA Studio/ Cockpit/ DBA Cockpit) in the Azure portal.
Support for multistreaming data backups
Parameters to enable SAP HANA settings for multistreaming:parallel_data_backup_backint_channelsdata_backup_buffer_size (optional)NoteBy setting the above HANA parameters will lead to increased memory and CPU utilization. We recommend that you monitor the memory consumption and CPU utilization as overutilization might negatively impact the backup and other HANA operations.

Backup performance for databases: The performance gain will be more prominent for larger databases.

Database size applicable for multistreaming: The number of multistreaming channels applies to all data backupslarger than 128 GB. Data backups smaller than 128 GB always use only one channel.
Database size applicable for multistreaming: The number of multistreaming channels applies to all data backupslarger than 128 GB. Data backups smaller than 128 GB always use only one channel.
Supported backup throughput: Multistreaming currently supports the data backup throughput of up to1.5 GBps. Recovery throughput is slower than the backup throughput.

Support for Azure Backup Multiple Components on One System (MCOS)
Azure Backup for SAP HANA supports backing up multiple SAP HANA systems (SIDs) on a single host. SAP HANA MCOS support includes the following configurations.
