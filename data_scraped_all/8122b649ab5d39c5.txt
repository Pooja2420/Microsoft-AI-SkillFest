Azure Pipelines supports a number of settings at the pipeline, project, and organization levels. These settings have been designed to help customers secure their pipelines. However, not many customers are familiar with these settings. This leaves their pipelines vulnerable. We want to address this by first making customers aware of best practices around security. This will include in-product experiences to surface information about when a setting does not follow a recommended value and various documentation improvements for fixing such settings.
