When an app needs to access an Azure resource like Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, or Azure AI services, the app must be authenticated to Azure. This requirement is true for all apps, whether they're deployed to Azure, deployed on-premises, or under development on a local developer workstation. This article describes the recommended approaches to authenticate an app to Azure when you use the Azure SDK for Python.
Recommended app authentication approach
Use token-based authentication rather than connection strings for your apps when they authenticate to Azure resources. TheAzure Identity client library for Pythonprovides classes that support token-based authentication and allow apps to seamlessly authenticate to Azure resources whether the app is in local development, deployed to Azure, or deployed to an on-premises server.
The specific type of token-based authentication an app uses to authenticate to Azure resources depends on where the app is being run. The types of token-based authentication are shown in the following diagram.

When a developer is running an app during local development:The app authenticates to Azure by using either an application service principal for local development or the developer's Azure credentials. These options are discussed in the sectionAuthentication during local development.
When an app is hosted on Azure:The app authenticates to Azure resources by using a managed identity. This option is discussed in the sectionAuthentication in server environments.
When an app is hosted and deployed on-premises:The app authenticates to Azure resources by using an application service principal. This option is discussed in the sectionAuthentication in server environments.
DefaultAzureCredential
TheDefaultAzureCredentialclass provided by the Azure Identity client library allows apps to use different authentication methods depending on the environment in which they're run. In this way, apps can be promoted from local development to test environments to production without code changes.
You configure the appropriate authentication method for each environment, andDefaultAzureCredentialautomatically detects and uses that authentication method. The use ofDefaultAzureCredentialis preferred over manually coding conditional logic or feature flags to use different authentication methods in different environments.

Advantages of token-based authentication
Use token-based authentication instead of using connection strings when you build apps for Azure. Token-based authentication offers the following advantages over authenticating with connection strings:
The token-based authentication methods described in this article allow you to establish the specific permissions needed by the app on the Azure resource. This practice follows theprinciple of least privilege. In contrast, a connection string grants full rights to the Azure resource.
Anyone or any app with a connection string can connect to an Azure resource, but token-based authentication methods scope access to the resource to only the apps intended to access the resource.
With a managed identity, there's no application secret to store. The app is more secure because there's no connection string or application secret that can be compromised.
Theazure-identitypackage acquires and manages Microsoft Entra tokens for you. This makes using token-based authentication as easy to use as a connection string.
Limit the use of connection strings to initial proof-of-concept apps or development prototypes that don't access production or sensitive data. Otherwise, the token-based authentication classes available in the Azure Identity client library are always preferred when they're authenticating to Azure resources.
Authentication in server environments
When you're hosting in a server environment, each app is assigned a uniqueapplication identityper environment where the app runs. In Azure, an application identity is represented by aservice principal. This special type of security principal identifies and authenticates apps to Azure. The type of service principal to use for your app depends on where your app is running:
Learn about auth from Azure-hosted apps
AZURE_CLIENT_ID
AZURE_TENANT_ID
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
Learn about auth from apps hosted outside of Azure
Authentication during local development
When an app runs on a developer's workstation during local development, it still must authenticate to any Azure services used by the app. There are two main strategies for authenticating apps to Azure during local development:
Learn about auth using developer service principals
Learn about auth using developer accounts
Use DefaultAzureCredential in an application
DefaultAzureCredentialis an opinionated, ordered sequence of mechanisms for authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID. Each authentication mechanism is a class that implements theTokenCredentialprotocol and is known as acredential. At runtime,DefaultAzureCredentialattempts to authenticate using the first credential. If that credential fails to acquire an access token, the next credential in the sequence is attempted, and so on, until an access token is successfully obtained. In this way, your app can use different credentials in different environments without writing environment-specific code.
DefaultAzureCredential
To useDefaultAzureCredentialin a Python app, add theazure-identitypackage to your application.
DefaultAzureCredential
pip install azure-identity
pip install azure-identity
Azure services are accessed using specialized client classes from the various Azure SDK client libraries. The following code example shows how to instantiate aDefaultAzureCredentialobject and use it with an Azure SDK client class. In this case, it's aBlobServiceClientobject used to access Azure Blob Storage.
DefaultAzureCredential
BlobServiceClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Acquire a credential object
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
        account_url="https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net",
        credential=credential)
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Acquire a credential object
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
        account_url="https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net",
        credential=credential)
When the preceding code runs on your local development workstation, it looks in the environment variables for an application service principal or at locally installed developer tools, such as the Azure CLI, for a set of developer credentials. Either approach can be used to authenticate the app to Azure resources during local development.
When deployed to Azure, this same code can also authenticate your app to Azure resources.DefaultAzureCredentialcan retrieve environment settings and managed identity configurations to authenticate to Azure services automatically.
