To create a Managed DevOps Pool, you must currently be anOrganization-level Agent pools administrator or a Project Collection Administrator in Azure DevOps. We're enabling a new mode of Managed DevOps Pools creation, requiring only Project-level Agent pools administrator. Managed DevOps Pools created using Project-level Agent pools administrator will be created and enabled only for use in the designated Azure DevOps Project.
