Applies to:Azure SQL DatabaseAzure SQL Managed Instance
Azure Policy can enforce the creation of an Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance withMicrosoft Entra-only authenticationenabled during provisioning. With this policy in place, any attempts to create alogical server in Azureor managed instance will fail if it isn't created with Microsoft Entra-only authentication enabled.
Note
Although Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) has beenrenamed to Microsoft Entra ID, the policy names currently contain the original Azure AD name, so Microsoft Entra-only and Azure AD-only authentication is used interchangeably in this article.
The Azure Policy can be applied to the whole Azure subscription, or just within a resource group.
Two new built-in policies have been introduced in Azure Policy:
Azure SQL Database should have Azure Active Directory Only Authentication enabled
Azure SQL Managed Instance should have Azure Active Directory Only Authentication enabled
For more information on Azure Policy, seeWhat is Azure Policy?andAzure Policy definition structure.
Permissions
For an overview of the permissions needed to manage Azure Policy, seeAzure RBAC permissions in Azure Policy.

Manage Azure Policy for Azure AD-only authentication
The Azure AD-only authentication policies can be managed by going to theAzure portal, and searching for thePolicyservice. UnderDefinitions, search forAzure Active Directory-only authentication.

For a guide, seeUsing Azure Policy to enforce Microsoft Entra-only authentication with Azure SQL.
There are three effects for these policies:
Audit- The default setting, and will only capture an audit report in the Azure Policy activity logs
Deny- Prevents logical server or managed instance creation withoutMicrosoft Entra-only authentication with Azure SQLenabled
Disabled- Will disable the policy, and won't restrict users from creating a logical server or managed instance without Microsoft Entra-only authentication enabled
If the Azure Policy for Azure AD-only authentication is set toDeny, creating a logical server or managed instance fails. The details of this failure are recorded in theActivity logof the resource group.
Policy compliance
You can view theCompliancesetting under thePolicyservice to see the compliance state. TheCompliance statewill tell you whether the server or managed instance is currently in compliance with having Microsoft Entra-only authentication enabled.
The Azure Policy can prevent a new logical server or managed instance from being created without having Microsoft Entra-only authentication enabled, but the feature can be changed after server or managed instance creation. If a user has disabled Microsoft Entra-only authentication after the server or managed instance was created, the compliance state will beNon-compliantif the Azure Policy is set toDeny.
Non-compliant

Limitations
Azure Policy enforces Azure AD-only authentication during logical server or managed instance creation. Once the server is created, authorized Microsoft Entra users with special roles (for example, SQL Security Manager) can disable the Azure AD-only authentication feature. The Azure Policy allows it, but in this case, the server or managed instance will be listed in the compliance report asNon-compliantand the report will indicate the server or managed instance name.
Non-compliant
