Q: How do I find a Project Collection Administrator?
A: If you have at leastBasicaccess, you can find a member of theProject Collection Administratorsgroup in your organization's or collection's settings.
For more information, seeLook up a project collection administrator.
Why can't users access some features?
Q: They might need a differentaccess levelassigned, in addition to permissions granted through security groups. For example,Stakeholder accessaccess level provides partial support to select features, allowing users to view and modify work items, but not to use all features.
I accidentally removed my permissions and am unable to grant them again. What should I do?
A: The only way to resolve this scenario is toRequest an increase in permission levels.

Visual Studio subscriptions
Q: When do I select "Visual Studio/MSDN Subscriber"?
A: Assign this access level to users who have active, validVisual Studio subscriptions. Azure DevOps automatically recognizes and validates Visual Studio subscribers who have Azure DevOps as a benefit. You need the email address associated with the subscription.
If the user doesn't have a valid, active Visual Studio subscription, they can work onlyas a Stakeholder.

Q: Which Visual Studio subscriptions can I use with Azure DevOps?
A:  SeeAzure DevOps benefits for Visual Studio subscribers.


Q: Why doesn't my Visual Studio subscription validate?
A: SeeWhy doesn't Azure DevOps recognize my Visual Studio subscription?

Q: Why do Visual Studio subscriber access levels change after a subscriber signs in?
A: Azure DevOps recognizes Visual Studio subscribers. Users automatically have access, based on their subscription, not on the current access level assigned to the user.

Q: What happens if a user's subscription expires?
A: If no other access levels are available, users canwork as Stakeholders. To restore access, a user must renew their subscription.

GitHub Enterprise
Q: Which GitHub Enterprise customers are eligible for Azure DevOps access?
A: GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers who access GitHub and Azure DevOps with the same Entra tenant. Users must sign in using the same identity in GitHub and Azure DevOps.

Q: Are users using GitHub Enterprise Server detected as having GitHub Enterprise?
A: Users of GitHub Enterprise Server are detected if they also have a matching license in the cloud. For more information, seeSyncing license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
Q: What kind of access do GitHub Enterprise users get in Azure DevOps?
A: Basic access, which includes all features except Test Plans. For more information, seePricing for Azure DevOps
Q: How are GitHub Enterprise users detected?
A: Azure DevOps automatically checks if a user has GitHub Enterprise when the user signs in. It can take up to 24 hours for their access level to change to GitHub Enterprise. There are no charges for a user with the GitHub Enterprise access level.
Q: What access level should I select if a user has a GitHub Enterprise license?
A: If you know a user has a GitHub Enterprise license, the best option to choose is Stakeholder, to avoid any charges for Basic before the user signs in for the first time
Q: What if a GitHub Enterprise user needs access to Test Plans?
A: GitHub Enterprise users who need access to Test Plans can be assigned the Basic + Test Plans access level.
Q: What if a GitHub Enterprise user also has a Visual Studio subscription?
A: If a user accessing Azure DevOps has both a GitHub Enterprise and Visual Studio subscription, they get detected as a Visual Studio subscriber. A Visual Studio subscription always gives them the same Basic access, and might provide access to Test Plans, depending on the subscription level.

User access
Q: What does "Last Access" mean in the All Users view?
A: The value inLast Accessis the last date a user accessed any resources or services. Accessing Azure DevOps includes usingOrganizationName.visualstudio.com directly and using resources or services indirectly. For example, you might use theAzure Artifactsextension, or you can push code to Azure DevOps from a Git command line or IDE.

Q: Can a user who paid for Basic access join other organizations?
A: No, a user can join only the organization for which the user paid for Basic access. But a user can join any organization where free users with Basic access are still available. The user can also join as a user with Stakeholder access for free.

Q: Why can't users access some features?
A: Make sure that users have the correct access level assigned to them.

Some features are available only as extensions. You need to install these extensions. Most extensions require you to have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder access. Check the extension's description in theVisual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab.
For example, to search your code, you can install the freeCode Search extension, but you need at least Basic access to use the extension.
To help your team improve app quality, you can install the freeTest & Feedback extension, but you get different capabilities based on your access level and whether you work offline or connected to Azure DevOps Services.
SomeVisual Studio subscriberscan use this feature for free, but Basic users need to upgrade to Basic + Test Plans access before they can create test plans.

Q: Why does a user lose access to some features?
A: A user can lose access for the following reasons (although the user can continue towork as a Stakeholder):
The user's Visual Studio subscription expired. Meanwhile, the user canwork as a Stakeholder, or you can give the user Basic access until the user renews their subscription. After the user signs in, Azure DevOps restores access automatically.

Otherwise, on the first day of the calendar month, users who haven't signed in to your organization for the longest time lose access first. If your organization has users who don't need access anymore,remove them from your organization.

Q: How does my user account inherit permissions from other Microsoft Entra groups?
A: If a user is in more than one Microsoft Entra group, aDENYpermission set in one group applies to the user in all groups the user is in. Because the permission is set toDENYfor the user at the lowest possible level, the user's usage of the resource is affected in all groups they are in because denial always takes precedence.
For example, if a user is in the Contributor group and in the Project Administrator group andDENYis set for a specific permission in the Contributor group, that permission is denied for the user in the Project Administrator group, too. In this scenario, you can use theNot setoption.
For more information about permissions states, seePermission states.

Q: How do I remove users from Azure DevOps?
A: SeeHow to remove users from Azure DevOps.
Q: I added a user to my project. Why can't they see the project?
A: Verify the user isn't added to a group where the project-levelView project-level informationpermission isn't set or is set toDeny. For more information, seeChange project-level permissions.
Q: Why can't guest users search for Microsoft Entra users?
A: By default,Access via Microsoft Entra FAQs. Microsoft Entra guests can't search the Microsoft Entra ID in the manner required by Azure DevOps.
Change app access policies for your organization
Q: If I deny access to one authentication method in one organization, does that affect all the organizations that I own?
A:  No, you can still use that method in all the other organizations that you own.Personal access tokensapply to specific organizations or to all organizations, based on your selection when you created the token.
Q:  If I deny access to an authentication method, then allow access again, will the apps that need access continue to work?
A: Yes, those apps continue to work.

Organizations
Q: How do I remove myself from an organization when the owner isn't available to remove me?
A: To remove yourself from an organization, do the following steps:
Go toaex.dev.azure.com.
Go toaex.dev.azure.com.
Select the organization, and then chooseLeave.

Q: Why can't I create an organization?
A: Contact your administrator to determine if your organization is usingthe Microsoft Entra tenant policy to restrict new organization creation.
Group-based licensing
Q: Will my users lose their access level and project membership if I remove a group rule?
A: Users in the groupTestGrouplose access to group resources if the users haven't been explicitly assigned to the resources or assigned via a different group rule.

Q: Will my Azure DevOps or Microsoft Entra group get deleted if I remove its group rule?
A: No. Your groups don't get deleted.
Q: What does the option "Remove <group> from all project level groups" do?
A: This option removes the Azure DevOps or Microsoft Entra group from any project-level default groups, such asProject ReadersorProject Contributors.
Q: What determines the final access level if a user is in more than one group?
A: Group rule types are ranked in the following order: Subscriber > Basic + Test Plans > Basic > Stakeholder.
Users always get the best access level between all the group rules, including Visual Studio subscription.
See the following examples, showing how the subscriber detection factors into group rules.
Example 1: group rule gives me more access.
If I have a Visual Studio Pro subscription and I'm in a group rule that gives me Basic + Test Plans â what happens?
Expected: I get Basic + Test Plans because what the group rule gives me is greater than my subscription.
Example 2: group rule gives me the same access.
I have a Visual Studio Test Pro subscription and I'm in a group rule that gives me Basic + Test Plans what happens?
Expected: I get detected as a Visual Studio Test Pro subscriber, because the access is the same as the group rule, and I'm already paying for the Visual Studio Test Pro, so I don't want to pay again.

Add members to projects
Q: Why can't I add any more members to my project?
A: Your organization is free for the first five users with Basic access. You can add unlimited Stakeholders and Visual Studio subscribers for no extra charge. After you assign all five free users with Basic access, you can continue adding Stakeholders and Visual Studio subscribers.
To add six or more users with Basic access, you need toset up billing in Azure. Then, you canpay for more users who need Basic access, return to your organization,add these users, and assign them Basic access. When billing is set up, you pay monthly for the extra users' access. And can cancel at any time.
If you need more Visual Studio subscriptions, learnhow to buy subscriptions.

Q: Why can't some users sign in?
A: This problem might happen because users must sign in with Microsoft accounts unless your organization controls access with Microsoft Entra ID. If your organization is connected to Microsoft Entra ID, users must be directory members to get access.
If you're a Microsoft Entra Administrator, you can add users to the directory. If you're not a Microsoft Entra Administrator, work with the directory administrator to add them. Learnabout controlling organization access with Microsoft Entra ID.
Q: Why did some users lose access to certain features?
A: Loss of access might happen fordifferent reasons.

Q: How do I remove users from my organization?
A: Learnhow to delete usersacross all projects in your organization. If you paid for more users but don't need their organization access anymore, you must reduce your paid users to avoid charges.
Q: Why can't I find members from my connected Microsoft Entra ID, even though I'm the global admin?
A: You're probably a guest in the Microsoft Entra instance that backs Azure DevOps. By default, Microsoft Entra guests can't search in Microsoft Entra ID. That's why you aren't finding users in your connected Microsoft Entra ID to add to your organization.
First, check to see if you're a Microsoft Entra guest:
Go to theSettingssection of your organization. Look at the lowerMicrosoft Entra IDsection. Make a note of the tenant that backs your organization.

If you're a Microsoft Entra guest, do one of the following steps:
Have another Azure DevOps admin, who isn't a Microsoft Entra guest, manage the users in Azure DevOps for you. Members of the Project Collection Administrators group inside Azure DevOps can administer users.
Have the Microsoft Entra admin remove your account from the connected directory and readd it. The admin needs to make you a Microsoft Entra member rather than a guest. SeeCan Microsoft Entra B2B users be added as members instead of guests?
Change theUser Typeof the Microsoft Entra guest by using Microsoft Graph PowerShell. We don't advise using the following process, but it works and allows the user to query Microsoft Entra ID from Azure DevOps  thereafter.
Download and install Microsoft Graph PowerShell.PS Install-Module -Name Microsoft Graph
Download and install Microsoft Graph PowerShell.
PS Install-Module -Name Microsoft Graph
PS Install-Module -Name Microsoft Graph
Open PowerShell and run the following cmdlets.a. Connect to Microsoft Entra ID:PS Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'User.Read.All'b. Find theobjectIdof the user:PS Get-MgUser -Filter "UserPrincipalName eq '<YourUPN>'"c. Check theusertypeattribute for this user to see if they're a guest or member:PS Get-MgUser -UserId <Id> -Property DisplayName, ID, UserPrincipalName, UserType | Select DisplayName, ID, UserPrincipalName, UserTyped. Change theusertypefrommembertoguest:PS Update-MgUser -UserID <replace the  ID for the result of the command to search> -UserType Member
Open PowerShell and run the following cmdlets.
a. Connect to Microsoft Entra ID:

Q: Why don't users appear or disappear promptly in Azure DevOps after I add or delete them in the Users hub?
A: If you experience delays finding new users or having deleted users promptly removed from Azure DevOps (for example, in drop-down lists and groups) after you add or delete users,file a problem report on Developer Communityso we can investigate.

Why do I have to choose between a "work or school account" and my "personal account"?
You have to choose between a "work or school account" and your "personal account" when you sign in with an email address (for example, jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com) shared by both accounts. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate and have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.
SelectWork or school accountif you used this identity to create your organization or previously signed in with it. Your organization's directory in Microsoft Entra ID authenticates your identity and controls access to your organization.
SelectWork or school accountif you used this identity to create your organization or previously signed in with it. Your organization's directory in Microsoft Entra ID authenticates your identity and controls access to your organization.
SelectPersonal accountif you used your Microsoft account with Azure DevOps. The global directory for Microsoft accounts authenticates your identity.

Why can't I sign in after I select "personal Microsoft account" or "work or school account"?
If your sign-in address is shared by both your personal Microsoft account and your work or school account, but the selected identity doesn't have access, you can't sign in. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate and have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.

Switch between accounts in the Azure portal and Azure DevOps
Q: As an administrator, how can I make it easier to switch between accounts across the Azure portal and Azure DevOps?
A: Managing multiple accounts can be cumbersome and time-consuming. To streamline the process, consider the following actions:
Use different browsers or profiles:Use different web browsers or browser profiles for each account to stay signed into multiple accounts simultaneously without switching back and forth.
Utilize incognito/private browsing:Use an incognito or private browsing window to temporarily access a different account without affecting your current session.
Single sign-on (SSO):If supported by your organization, implement single sign-on (SSO) to streamline the sign-in process across Azure services.
