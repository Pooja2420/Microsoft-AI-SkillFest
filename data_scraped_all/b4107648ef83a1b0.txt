App Service domains are custom domains that are managed directly in Azure. They make it easy to manage custom domains forAzure App Service. This article shows you how to buy an App Service domain and configure an App Service app with it.
Prerequisites
Create an App Service app, or use an app that you created for another tutorial. The app should be in an Azure Public region. At this time, Azure national clouds are not supported.
To use an App Service domain, the app'sApp Service planmust be a paid tier, not a Free (F1) tier. SeeScale up an appto update the tier.
Remove the spending limit on your subscription.
Note
For some subscriptions types, before you can create an App Service domain, the subscription needs to have sufficient history on Azure.
App Service domains aren't supported on free trial or credit-based subscriptions.
Buy and map an App Service domain
For pricing information on App Service domains, visit theApp Service Pricing pageand scroll down to App Service Domain.
In theAzure portal, navigate to your app's management page.

SelectBuy App Service domain.NoteYou can also create an App Service domain independently of an app by going to the App Service Domains view and selectingCreate, or by navigating tothe create page directly. But since the domain is independent from your app, you won't be able to assign hostnames likewwwto your app, which you can do if you create the domain from your app'sCustom domainspage.

Map a hostname manually
If launched from an app'sCustom domainspage, the App Service domain wizard already lets you map the root domain (likecontoso.com) and thewwwsubdomain (likewww.contoso.com) to your app. You can map any other subdomain to your app, likeshoppingcart(as inshoppingcart.contoso.com).
contoso.com

You might also see a red X and the textNo binding.If you selectedApp Service Managed Certificateearlier, wait a few minutes for App Service to create the managed certificate for your custom domain. When the process is complete, the red X becomes a green check mark with the wordSecured. If you selectedAdd certificate later, the red X will remain until youadd a private certificate for the domainandconfigure the binding.NoteUnless you configure a certificate binding for your custom domain, any HTTPS request from a browser to the domain will receive an error or warning, depending on the browser.

Renew the domain
The App Service domain you bought is valid for one year from the time of purchase. You can configure your domain to renew automatically, or you can manually renew your domain name up to 90 days ahead of domain expiration. Upon successful automatic or manual renewal, you'll be billed for the cost of the domain, and your domain expiration will be extended for another year.
Note
For .nl domains, you can only manually renew the domain starting 90 days ahead of domain expiration and up to the 20th of the month before the expiration date. You won't be able to renew the domain after this period even if the domain hasn't yet expired.
If you want to configure automatic renewal, or if you want to manually renew your domain, follow these steps:
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.

Select the domain you want to configure.
Select the domain you want to configure.
From the left navigation of the domain, selectDomain renewal. To start renewing your domain automatically, selectOn. Otherwise selectOff. The setting takes effect immediately. If automatic renewal is enabled, on the day after your domain expiration date, Azure attempts to bill you for the domain name renewal.NoteWhen navigating away from the page, disregard the "Your unsaved edits will be discarded" error by selectingOK.

To manually renew your domain, selectRenew domain. However, this button isn't active until 90 days before the domain's expiration date.
If your domain renewal is successful, you receive an email notification within 24 hours.

Manage custom DNS records
In Azure, DNS records for an App Service domain are managed usingAzure DNS. You can add, remove, and update DNS records just as you would for an externally purchased domain. To manage custom DNS records:
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.

Select the domain you want to configure.
Select the domain you want to configure.
From theOverviewpage, selectManage DNS records.

For information on how to edit DNS records, seeHow to manage DNS Zones in the Azure portal.
Update contact information
After you purchase the App Service domain, you can update the domain contact information if you need to. It's important to keep this contact information up to date so that you can receive notifications about your domain and receive verification emails if you decide to transfer out your domain. To update your contact information:
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.

Select the domain you want to configure.
Select the domain you want to configure.
From the left navigation of the domain, selectAdvanced domain management (preview). To update your contact information, selectEdit contact.

Once you submit the request, it might take some time for your contact information to update.NoteIf you have privacy protection disabled and update name or organization information, an email verification is sent to the email address on file for confirmation. Additionally, if you update your email address, a verification email is sent first to the previous email on file for confirmation. Once that's completed, another email is sent to the new email on file for confirmation. The contact information won't update until after you have confirmed via email.

Disable privacy protection
Important
Once you disable privacy protection, you can no longer re-enable privacy protection again.
Privacy protection hides your domain registration contact information from the WHOIS database. If it's enabled during domain creation, privacy protection is already included in the yearly domain registration fee for no additional cost. However, there are some scenarios, such as transferring the domain out, where you need to disable privacy protection, you can do that by:
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.

Select the domain you want to configure.
Select the domain you want to configure.
From the left navigation of the domain, selectAdvanced domain management (preview). To disable privacy protection, selectDisablein theDomain Privacysection.
From the left navigation of the domain, selectAdvanced domain management (preview). To disable privacy protection, selectDisablein theDomain Privacysection.

Cancel the purchase
After you purchase the App Service domain, you have five days to cancel your purchase and get a full refund. After five days, you can delete the App Service domain but can't receive a refund.
In the search bar, search for and selectApp Service Domains.

Frequently asked questions
Why do I see "This subscription does not have the billing support to purchase an App Service domain"?
Why do I get a SubscriptionExceededMaxDomainLimit error when creating an App Service domain?
How do I direct the default URL to a custom directory?
Free subscriptions, which don't require a confirmed credit card, don't have the permissions to buy App Service domains in Azure.
The number of App Service domains a subscription can have depends on the subscription type. Subscriptions that have a monthly credit allotment, like the Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, have a limit of one App Service domain. To increase your limit, convert to a pay-per-use subscription.
This is not a DNS resolution scenario. By default, App Service directs web requests to the root directory of your app code. To direct them to a subdirectory, such aspublic, seeRedirect to a custom directory.
