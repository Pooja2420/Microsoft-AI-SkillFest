Defender for Cloud uses aproprietary algorithm to locate potential attack pathsspecific to your multicloud environment. Instead of looking for preset attack paths, Defender for Cloud uses its algorithm to detect potential attack paths based on your multicloud security graph. Attack path analysis helps you focus on the most critical security issues that could lead to a breach.
You can use attack path analysis to address security issues that pose immediate threats and have the greatest potential for exploitation in your environment. Defender for Cloud analyzes which security issues are part of potential attack paths that attackers could use to breach your environment. It also highlights the security recommendations you need to resolve to mitigate these issues.
By default attack paths are organized by risk level. The risk level is determined by a context-aware risk-prioritization engine that considers the risk factors of each resource. Learn more about how Defender for Cloudprioritizes security recommendations.

Identify attack paths
The attack path page shows you an overview of all of your attack paths. You can also see your affected resources and a list of active attack paths.

You can use Attack path analysis  to locate the biggest risks to your environment and to remediate them.
To identify attack paths:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toMicrosoft Defender for Cloud>Attack path analysis.

Remediate attack paths
Once you're done with your investigation of an attack path and you review all of the associated findings and recommendations, you can start to remediate the attack path.
To remediate an attack path:
Navigate toMicrosoft Defender for Cloud>Attack path analysis.
Navigate toMicrosoft Defender for Cloud>Attack path analysis.
Select an attack path.

Remediate the recommendation.
Remediate the recommendation.
Once an attack path is resolved, it can take up to 24 hours for an attack path to be removed from the list.
Remediate all recommendations within an attack path
Attack path analysis grants you the ability to see all recommendations by attack path without having to check each node individually. You can resolve all recommendations without having to view each node individually.
The remediation path contains two types of recommendation:
Recommendations- Recommendations that mitigate the attack path.
Additional recommendations- Recommendations that reduce the exploitation risks, but donât mitigate the attack path.
To resolve all recommendations:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
