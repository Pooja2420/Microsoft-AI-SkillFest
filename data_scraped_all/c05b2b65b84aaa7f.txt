Configure a point-to-site User VPN connection - Microsoft Entra ID authentication
Article

This article helps you configure point-to-site User VPN connection to Virtual WAN that uses Microsoft Entra ID authentication and the newMicrosoft-registered Azure VPN Client App ID.
Virtual WAN now supports a Microsoft-registered App ID and corresponding Audience values for the latest versions of the Azure VPN Client. When you configure a P2S VPN gateway using the new Audience values, you skip the previously required Azure VPN Client app manual registration process for your Microsoft Entra tenant. The App ID is already created and your tenant is automatically able to use it with no extra registration steps. This process is more secure than manually registering the Azure VPN Client because you don't need to authorize the app or assign permissions via the Cloud App Administrator role. To better understand the difference between the types of application objects, seeHow and why applications are added to Microsoft Entra ID.
If your P2S User VPN gateway is configured using the Audience values for the manually configured Azure VPN Client app, you can easilychangethe gateway and client settings to take advantage of the new Microsoft-registered App ID. If you want Linux clients to connect, you must update the P2S gateway with the new Audience value. The Azure VPN Client for Linux isn't backward compatible with the older Audience values.

Considerations
A P2S User VPN gateway can only support one Audience value. It can't support multiple Audience values simultaneously.

Download a virtual WAN User VPN profile
Create a virtual hub
Edit a hub to add P2S gateway
Connect a virtual network to a virtual hub
Download and apply the User VPN client configuration
View your virtual WAN

Before you begin
Verify that you've met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:
You have a virtual network that you want to connect to. Verify that none of the subnets of your on-premises networks overlap with the virtual networks that you want to connect to. To create a virtual network in the Azure portal, see theQuickstart.
You have a virtual network that you want to connect to. Verify that none of the subnets of your on-premises networks overlap with the virtual networks that you want to connect to. To create a virtual network in the Azure portal, see theQuickstart.
Your virtual network doesn't have any virtual network gateways. If your virtual network has a gateway (either VPN or ExpressRoute), you must remove all gateways. The steps for this configuration help you connect your virtual network to the Virtual WAN virtual hub gateway.

Obtain an IP address range for your hub region. The hub is a virtual network that is created and used by Virtual WAN. The address range that you specify for the hub can't overlap with any of your existing virtual networks that you connect to. It also can't overlap with your address ranges that you connect to on premises. If you're unfamiliar with the IP address ranges located in your on-premises network configuration, coordinate with someone who can provide those details for you.

You need a Microsoft Entra ID tenant for this configuration. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the instructions inCreate a new tenant.

Create a User VPN configuration
A User VPN configuration defines the parameters for connecting remote clients. It's important to create the User VPN configuration before configuring your virtual hub with P2S settings, as you must specify the User VPN configuration you want to use.
Important
The Azure portal is in the process of updating Azure Active Directory fields to Entra. If you see Microsoft Entra ID referenced and you don't see those values in the portal yet, you can select Azure Active Directory values.

Create an empty hub
Next, create the virtual hub. The steps in this section create an empty virtual hub to which you can later add the P2S gateway. However, it's always much more efficient to combine creating the hub along with the gateway because each time you make a configuration change to the hub, you have to wait for the hub settings to build.
For demonstration purposes, we'll create an empty hub first, then add the P2S gateway in the next section. But, you can choose to incorporate the P2S gateway settings from the next section at the same time you configure the hub.
Go to the virtual WAN that you created. On the virtual WAN page left pane, under theConnectivity, selectHubs.

Download User VPN profile
All of the necessary configuration settings for the VPN clients are contained in a VPN client configuration zip file. The settings in the zip file help you easily configure the VPN clients. The VPN client configuration files that you generate are specific to the User VPN configuration for your gateway. You can download global (WAN-level) profiles, or a profile for a specific hub. For information and additional instructions, seeDownload global and hub profiles. The following steps walk you through downloading a global WAN-level profile.
