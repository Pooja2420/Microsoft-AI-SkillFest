This page provides examples of how you can use thescikit-learnpackage to train machine learning models in Azure Databricks.scikit-learnis one of the most popular Python libraries for single-node machine learning and is included in Databricks Runtime and Databricks Runtime ML. SeeDatabricks Runtime release notesfor the scikit-learn library version included with your clusterâs runtime.
scikit-learn
You canimport these notebooksand run them in your Azure Databricks workspace.
For additional example notebooks to get started quickly on Azure Databricks, seeTutorials: Get started with AI and machine learning.
Basic example using scikit-learn
This notebook provides a quick overview of machine learning model training on Azure Databricks. It uses thescikit-learnpackage to train a simple classification model. It also illustrates the use ofMLflowto track the model development process, andOptunato automate hyperparameter tuning.

End-to-end example using scikit-learn on Azure Databricks
This notebook uses scikit-learn to illustrate a complete end-to-end example of loading data, model training, distributed hyperparameter tuning, and model inference. It also illustrates model lifecycle management using MLflow Model Registry to log and register your model.
