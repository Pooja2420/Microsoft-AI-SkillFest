The remote access solution that you choose depends on factors like scale, topology, and security requirements. This article describes how to provide remote access to virtual machines (VMs) that are deployed within an Azure landing zone architecture. This guidance focuses on Azure Bastion for remote access.
Azure offers technologies that work together to facilitate highly secure remote access to virtual machines:
Azure Bastionis a platform as a service (PaaS) solution that you can use to access VMs through a browser or through the native SSH or RDP client on Windows workstations.

Just-in-time (JIT)access is provided through Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Design considerations
When available, you can use existing hybrid connectivity to Azure virtual networks via ExpressRoute or S2S and P2S VPN connections to provide remote access from on-premises to Windows and Linux Azure VMs.

JIT allows remote SSH and RDP access over the internet without having to deploy any other infrastructure for supported VMs. JIT supports:VMs deployed through Azure Resource Manager.VMs deployed with classic deployment models.VMs protected by Azure Firewalls on the same virtual network as the VM.VMs protected by Azure firewalls controlled by Azure Firewall Manager.

Azure Bastionprovides an extra layer of control. It enables highly secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to your VMs directly from the Azure portal ornative clientover a secure TLS channel. Azure Bastion also negates the need for hybrid connectivity.

Azure Bastion can be used in anAzure Virtual WAN topology. However, there are some limitations:Azure Bastion can't be deployed inside of a Virtual WAN virtual hub.Azure Bastion must use the Premium or Standard SKU. TheIP-based connectionfeature must be enabled on the Azure Bastion resource. For more information, seeAzure Bastion IP-based connection documentation.Azure Bastion can be deployed in any spoke virtual network that's connected to a Virtual WAN. Azure Bastion provides access to VMs in its own virtual network via Virtual WAN virtual network connections. It can also provide access to VMs in other virtual networks that are connected to the same Virtual WAN through its associated hubs. A successful deployment requires the appropriateroutingconfiguration. For example, you can deploy Azure Bastion by using thevirtual hub extension pattern.The Azure Bastion Standard SKU requires a dedicated subnet (AzureBastionSubnet), while the Developer SKU doesn't.

TheDeveloper SKUis a free, zero-configuration, always-on version of the Azure Bastion service. Unlike the Standard SKU, the Developer SKU isn't a dedicated resource but it operates as part of a shared pool and doesn't support virtual network peering.

Tip
Azure Bastion IP-based connection also allows for connectivity to on-premises-based machines if hybrid connectivity exists between the Azure Bastion resource and the machine that you want to connect to. For more information, seeConnect to a VM via a specified private IP address.
Design recommendations
For production workloads, deploy the Azure Bastion Premium or Standard SKU. For sandbox and test environments, use the Developer SKU inselected regions.

In a Virtual WAN-based network topology where you require remote access to VMs over the internet, you can deploy Azure Bastion in each spoke virtual network of the respective VMs.Or you might deploy a centralized Azure Bastion instance in a single spoke in your Virtual WAN topology. This configuration reduces the number of Azure Bastion instances to manage in your environment. This scenario requires users who sign in to Windows and Linux VMs via Azure Bastion to have aReader role on the Azure Bastion resource and the chosen spoke virtual network. Some implementations might have security or compliance considerations that restrict or prevent this requirement. The following diagram shows an Azure Virtual WAN topology.

Use Azure Bastion Basic or Standard SKU to provide connectivity to VMs within a spoke virtual network. Deploy a dedicated Azure Bastion instance into each spoke virtual network that requires remote access. The following diagram shows an Azure standalone virtual network topology.
