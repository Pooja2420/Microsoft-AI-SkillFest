In this article
If you read the Cost Analysis tutorial, then you're familiar with manually downloading your Cost Management data. However, you can create a recurring task that automatically exports your Cost Management data to Azure storage on a daily, or monthly basis. Exports is designed to streamline your FinOps practice by automating the export of other cost-impacting datasets. You can use the exported data with external systems and combine it with your own custom data.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create exports
Configure exports for storage accounts with a firewall
Manage exports
Enable file partitioning for large datasets
Verify that data is collected
View export run history
Understand export data types
Updated functionality
The exports feature supports multiple datasets including price sheets, reservation recommendations, reservation details, and reservation transactions. Also, you can download cost and usage details using the open-source FinOps Open Cost and Usage SpecificationFOCUSformat. It combines actual and amortized costs and reduces data processing times and storage and compute costs.
FinOps datasets are often large and challenging to manage. Exports improve file manageability, reduce download latency, and help save on storage and network charges with the following functionality:
File partitioning, which breaks the file into manageable smaller chunks.
File overwrite, which replaces the previous day's file with an updated file each day in daily export.
The exports feature has an updated user interface, which helps you to easily create multiple exports for various cost management datasets to Azure storage using a single, simplified create experience. Exports let you choose the latest or any of the earlier dataset schema versions when you create a new export. Supporting multiple versions ensures that the data processing layers that you built on for existing datasets are reused while you adopt the latest API functionality. You can selectively export historical data by rerunning an existing export job for a historical period. So, you don't have to create a new one-time export for a specific date range. You can enhance security and compliance by configuring exports to storage accounts behind a firewall. The Azure Storage firewall provides access control for the public endpoint of the storage account.
Prerequisites
Data export is available for various Azure account types, includingEnterprise Agreement (EA)andMicrosoft Customer Agreement (MCA)customers. To view the full list of supported account types, seeUnderstand Cost Management data. The following Azure permissions, or scopes, are supported per subscription for data export by user and group. For more information about scopes, seeUnderstand and work with scopes.
Owner - Can create, modify, or delete scheduled exports for a subscription.
Contributor - Can create, modify, or delete their own scheduled exports. Can modify the name of scheduled exports created by others.
Reader - Can schedule exports that they have permission to.For more information about scopes, including access needed to configure exports for Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer agreement scopes, seeUnderstand and work with scopes.

If you have a new subscription, you can't immediately use Cost Management features. It might take up to 48 hours before you can use all Cost Management features.
Create exports
You can create multiple exports of various data types using the following steps.
Note
You can create exports on subscription, resource group, management group, department, and enrollment scopes. For more information about scopes, seeUnderstand and work with scopes.
When you're signed in as a partner at the billing account scope or on a customer's tenant, you can export data to an Azure Storage account that's linked to your partner storage account. However, you must have an active subscription in your CSP tenant.
Choose a scope and navigate to Exports
Sign in to the Azure portal athttps://portal.azure.com.
Search forCost Management.
Select a billing scope.
In the left navigation menu, selectExports.
Create new exports
On the Exports page, at the top of the page, select+ Create.

SelectNextto move to theReview + createtab.
Review and create
Review your export configuration and make any necessary changes. When done, selectReview + createto complete the process.
Your new export appears in the list of exports. By default, new exports are enabled. If you want to disable or delete a scheduled export, select any item in the list, and then select eitherDisableorDelete.
The export process can take up to 24 hours to complete before the data is ready.
Configure exports for storage accounts with a firewall
If you need to export to a storage account behind the firewall for security and compliance requirements, ensure that you have allprerequisitesmet.
Note
If you have an existing scheduled export and your change your storage network configuration, you must update the export and save it to reflect the changes.
EnableAllow trusted Azure services accesson the storage account. You can turn that on while configuring the firewall of the storage account, from the Networking page. Here's a screenshot showing the page.

If you missed enabling that setting, it's automatically enabled when you create a new export and use an existing Storage account.

A system-assigned managed identity is created for a new job export when created or modified. You must have permissions because Cost Management uses the privilege to assign theStorageBlobDataContributorrole to the managed identity. The permission is restricted to the storage account container scope. After the export job is created or updated, the user doesn't require Owner permissions for regular runtime operations.
Note
When a user updates destination details or deletes an export, theStorageBlobDataContributorrole assigned to the managed identity is automatically removed. To enable the system to remove the role assignment, the user must havemicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/deletepermissions. If the permissions aren't available, the user needs to manually remove the role assignment on the managed identity.
microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete
Currently, firewalls are supported for storage accounts in the same tenant. However, firewalls on storage accounts aren't supported for cross-tenant exports.
Add exports to the list of trusted services. For more information, seeTrusted access based on a managed identity.
Manage exports
You can view the list of available exports by navigating to the Exports page and manage individual exports by selecting them.
You can perform the following actions on individual exports.
Run now - Queues an unplanned export to run at the next available moment, regardless of the scheduled run time.
Run now - Queues an unplanned export to run at the next available moment, regardless of the scheduled run time.
Export selected dates - Reruns an export for a historical date range instead of creating a new one-time export. You can extract up to 13 months of historical data in one-month chunks. This option isn't available for price sheets.

Refresh - Updates the Run history.
Refresh - Updates the Run history.

Understand schedule frequency
When you create a scheduled export, the export runs at the same frequency for each export that runs later. For instance, if the export is scheduled to run once every UTC day, it creates a daily export of costs accumulated from the start of the month to the current date. Individual export runs can occur at different times throughout the day, so avoid relying on the exact time of the export runs. The run timing depends on the active load present in Azure during a given UTC day. Once an export run begins, your data should be available within 4 hours. Exports are scheduled using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The Exports API always uses and displays UTC.
When you create an export using theExports API, specify therecurrencePeriodin UTC time. The API doesnât convert your local time to UTC.
recurrencePeriod
Example - A daily export is scheduled on Friday, August 19 withrecurrencePeriodset to 2:00 PM. The API receives the input as 2:00 PM UTC, Friday, August 19.
recurrencePeriod
When you create an export in the Azure portal, its start date time is automatically converted to the equivalent UTC time.
Example - A daily export is scheduled on Friday, August 19 with the local time of 2:00 AM IST (UTC+5:30) from the Azure portal. The API receives the input as 8:30 PM, Thursday, August 18.
Various datasets support different schedule frequency options as described in the following table.
Optional - Create an export for multiple subscriptions
You can use a management group to aggregate subscription cost information in a single container. Exports support management group scope for Enterprise Agreement but not for Microsoft Customer Agreement or other subscription types. Multiple currencies are also not supported in management group exports.
Exports at the management group scope support only usage charges. Purchases, including reservations and savings plans aren't supported. Amortized cost reports are also not supported. When you create an export from the Azure portal for a management group scope, the metric field isn't shown because it defaults to the usage type. When you create a management group scope export using the REST API, chooseExportTypeasUsage.
Usage
Create one management group and assign subscriptions to it, if you haven't already.
In cost analysis, set the scope to your management group and selectSelect this management group.
Create an export at the scope to get cost management data for the subscriptions in the management group.
File partitioning for large datasets
The file partitioning is a feature that is activated by default to facilitate the management of large files. This functionality divides larger files into smaller segments, which enhances the ease of file transfer, download, ingestion, and overall readability. It's advantageous for customers whose cost files increase in size over time. The specifics of the file partitions are described in a manifest.json file provided with each export run, enabling you to rejoin the original file.
Manifest file
With every export, run you get multiple partitions of the data along with a manifest.json file. The manifest contains a summary of the full dataset and information for each file partition in it. Each file partition has headers and contains only a subset of the full dataset. To handle the full dataset, you must ingest each partition of the export.
Here's a _manifest.json example manifest file.

Verify that data is collected
You can easily verify that your Cost Management data is being collected and view the exported CSV file using Azure Storage Explorer.
In the export list, select the storage account name. On the storage account page, select Open in Explorer. If you see a confirmation box, selectYesto open the file in Azure Storage Explorer.

In Storage Explorer, navigate to the container that you want to open and select the folder corresponding to the current month. A list of CSV files is shown. Select one and then selectOpen.
The file opens with the program or application set to open CSV file extensions. Here's an example in Excel.

Download an exported data file
To download the exported CSV or Parquet file, browse to the file in Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer and download it.
View export run history
You can view the run history of your scheduled export by selecting an individual export in the exports list page. The exports list page also provides you with quick access to view the run time of your previous exports and the next time and export will run. Here's an example showing the run history.

Select an export to view the run history.

Cost export runs twice a day for the first five days of the month
There are two runs per day for the first five days of each month after you create a daily export of cost and usage details dataset. One run executes and creates a file with the current monthâs cost data. It's the run that's available for you to see in the run history. A second run also executes to create a file with all the costs from the prior month. The second run isn't currently visible in the run history. Azure executes the second run to ensure that your latest file for the past month contains all charges exactly as seen on your invoice. It runs because there are cases where latent usage and charges are included in the invoice up to 72 hours after the calendar month is closed. To learn more about Cost Management usage data updates, seeCost and usage data updates and retention.
Note
Daily export created between 1st to 5th of the current month wouldn't generate data for the previous month as the export schedule starts from the date of creation.
Understand export data types
For a comprehensive reference of all available datasets, including the schema for current and historical versions, seeCost Management dataset schema index.
Cost and usage details (actual) - Select this option to export standard usage and purchase charges.

FAQ
Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about exports.
Why is file partitioning enabled in exports?
The file partitioning is a feature that is activated by default to facilitate the management of large files. This functionality divides larger files into smaller segments, which enhances the ease of file transfer, download, ingestion, and overall readability. It's advantageous for customers whose cost files increase in size over time. The specifics of the file partitions are described in a manifest.json file provided with each export run, enabling you to rejoin the original file.
How does the enhanced export experience handle missing attributes like subscription IDs?
In the new export experience, missing attributes such as subscription IDs are set to null or empty rather than using a default empty GUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). The null or empty values more accurately indicate the absence of a value. It affects charges pertaining to unused reservations, unused savings plan, and rounding adjustments.
How much historical data can I retrieve using exports?
You can retrieve historical data using exports through either theAzure portalor theREST API, depending on your dataset and time range requirements.
The Azure portal supports retrieval of up to13 monthsof historical data for most datasets.
To retrieve historical data:
Create a one-time or custom export (e.g., Actual cost, Amortized cost, or Price sheet).
After saving the export, go toCost Management > Exports, and select your export.
ClickExport selected datesto rerun the export for specific historical months â note that data can be retrievedone month at a time, up to the 13-month limit.
Note
Reservation recommendations are based on the current snapshot only and do not support historical backfill.
To access data older than 13 months, use theExports - Execute REST API.
This method allows programmatic backfill of data for specific date ranges, depending on dataset availability.
Tip
For retrieving more than 13 months of historical data, or automating backfills at scale, the REST API is recommended.
Which datasets support Parquet format and compression?
The following table captures the supported formats and compression formats for each of the exported datasets. If you're creating an export with multiple datasets, Parquet & compression options only appear in the dropdown if all of the selected datasets support them.
Why do I get the 'Unauthorized' error while trying to create an Export?
When attempting to create an Export to a storage account with a firewall, the user must have the Owner role or a custom role withMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writeandMicrosoft.Authorization/permissions/readpermissions. If these permissions are missing, you encounter an error similar to:
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Microsoft.Authorization/permissions/read
{
	"error":{
	"code":"Unauthorized",
	"message":"The user does not have authorization to perform 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' action on specified storage account, please use a storage account with sufficient permissions. If the permissions have changed recently then retry after some time."
	}
}
{
	"error":{
	"code":"Unauthorized",
	"message":"The user does not have authorization to perform 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' action on specified storage account, please use a storage account with sufficient permissions. If the permissions have changed recently then retry after some time."
	}
}
You can check for the permissions on the storage account by referring to the steps inCheck access for a user to a single Azure resource.
What is the maximum number of subscriptions allowed within a management group (MG) when creating an export?
The maximum limit is3,000 subscriptionsper management group in Cost Management, including exports.
To manage more than 3,000 subscriptions:
Organize them into smaller management groups. For example, if you have a total of 12,500 subscriptions, create five management groups with approximately 2,500 subscriptions each. Create separate exports for each management group scope and combine the exported data for a complete view.

How are the exported files organized in the blob storage folders?
The exported files are organized in a structured hierarchy within the storage folders. The naming and hierarchy of the folders are as follows:
StorageContainer/StorageDirectory/ExportName/[YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD]/[RunID]/
StorageContainer/StorageDirectory/ExportName/[YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD]/[RunID]/
This path contains the CSV files and a manifest file.
For example:
StorageContainer/StorageDirectory/ExportName/[20240401-20240430]/[RunID1]/
StorageContainer/StorageDirectory/ExportName/[20240401-20240430]/[RunID1]/
This folder contains the CSV files and the manifest file for all export runs during the April 2024 time period.
StorageContainer/StorageDirectory/ExportName/[20241101-20241130]/[RunID2]/
StorageContainer/StorageDirectory/ExportName/[20241101-20241130]/[RunID2]/
This folder contains the CSV files and the manifest file for all export runs during the November 2024 time period.
Azure ensures that the cost file for a particular month is available within that month's folder. For example,[20240401-20240430],[20241101-20241130]and so on.
[20240401-20240430]
[20241101-20241130]
Without file overwrite:You see multipleRunIDswithin the month folder, representing different export runs. For example, 30 differentRunIDsfor 30 days.

Why do I see garbled characters when I open exported cost files with Microsoft Excel?
If you see garbled characters in Excel and you use an Asian-based language, such as Japanese or Chinese, you can resolve this issue with the following steps:
For new versions of Excel:
Open Excel.
Select theDatatab at the top.
Select theFrom Text/CSVoption.
Select the CSV file that you want to import.
In the next box, setFile originto65001: Unicode (UTF-8).
SelectLoad.
For older versions of MS Excel:
Open Excel.
Select theDatatab at the top.
Select theFrom Textoption and then select the CSV file that you want to import.
Excel shows the Text Import Wizard.
In the wizard, select theDelimitedoption.
In theFile originfield, select65001 : Unicode (UTF-8).
SelectNext.
Next, select theCommaoption and then selectFinish.
In the dialog window that appears, selectOK.
Why does the aggregated cost from the exported file differ from the cost displayed in Cost Analysis?
You might notice discrepancies between the aggregated cost from an exported file and the cost displayed in Cost Analysis. These differences can occur if the tool you use to read and aggregate the total cost truncates decimal values. This issue is common in tools like Power BI and Microsoft Excel.
Check if decimal places are being dropped when cost values are converted into integers. Losing decimal values can result in a loss of precision and misrepresentation of the aggregated cost.
