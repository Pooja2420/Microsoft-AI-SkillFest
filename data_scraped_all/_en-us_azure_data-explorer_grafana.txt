Grafana is an analytics platform where you can query and visualize data, and then create and share dashboards based on your visualizations. Grafana provides an Azure Data Explorerplug-in, which enables you to connect to and visualize data from Azure Data Explorer. The plug-in works with bothAzure Managed Grafanaand self-hosted Grafana.
In this article, you learn how toconfigure your cluster as a data source for Grafanaandvisualize data in Grafanafor Azure Managed Grafana and self-hosted Grafana. To follow along with the examples in this article,ingest the StormEvents sample data. The StormEvents sample dataset contains weather-related data from theNational Centers for Environmental Information.
Prerequisites
For Azure Managed Grafana, an Azure account andAzure Managed Grafanainstance.
For self-hosted Grafana,Grafana version 5.3.0 or laterfor your operating system and theAzure Data Explorer plug-infor Grafana. You need plug-in version 3.0.5 or later to use the Grafana query builder.
An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. You cancreate a free clusterorcreate a full cluster. To decide which is best for you, check thefeature comparison.
Configure the data source
To configure Azure Data Explorer as a data source, follow the steps for your Grafana environment.
Azure Managed Grafana
Self-hosted Grafana
Managed Grafana creates a system-assigned managed identity for each new workspace, by default. You can use it to access your Azure Data Explorer cluster.
In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Data Explorer cluster.

You can create the service principal in theAzure portalor by using theAzure CLIcommand-line experience. After you create the service principal, you get values for four connection properties that you'll use in later steps.

Now that you have a service principal, you add it to theViewerrole in the Azure Data Explorer database. You can perform this task underPermissionsin the Azure portal, or underQueryby using a management command.

You can use two features for query optimization:
Optimize dashboard query rendering performance
Enable weak consistency
To perform the optimization, inData Sources>Settings>Query Optimizations, make the needed changes.

When a dashboard or visual is rendered more than once by one or more users, Grafana sends at least one query to Azure Data Explorer by default. EnableQuery results cachingto improve dashboard rendering performance and to reduce load on the Azure Data Explorer cluster.
During the specified time range, Azure Data Explorer will use the results cache to retrieve the previous results and won't run an unnecessary query. This capability is especially effective in reducing load on resources and improving performance when multiple users are using the same dashboard.
To enable results cache rendering, do the following on theQuery Optimizationspane:
Turn offUse dynamic caching.
InCache Max Age, enter the number of minutes during which you want to use cached results.
Clusters are configured with strong consistency. This default configuration guarantees that query results are up to date with all changes in the cluster.
When you enable weak consistency, query results can have a lag of 1 to 2 minutes after cluster alterations. However, weak consistency might boost visual rendering time. If immediate consistency isn't critical and performance is marginal, enable weak consistency to improve performance. For more information, seeQuery consistency.
To enable weak consistency, on theQuery Optimizationspane, selectData consistency>Weak.
Visualize data
You finished configuring Azure Data Explorer as a data source for Grafana. Now it's time to visualize data.
The following basic example uses both the query builder mode and the raw mode of the query editor. We recommend that you viewwrite queries for Azure Data Explorerfor examples of other queries to run against the dataset.
