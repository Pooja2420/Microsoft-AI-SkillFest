The term "autoinstrumentation" is a portmanteau, a linguistic blend where parts of multiple words combine into a new word. "Autoinstrumentation" combines "auto" and "instrumentation." It sees widespread use in software observability and describes the process of adding instrumentation code to applications without manual coding by developers.
The autoinstrumentation process varies by language and platform, but often involves a toggle button in the Azure portal. The following example shows a toggle button forAzure App Serviceautoinstrumentation.

Supported environments, languages, and resource providers
The following table shows the current state of autoinstrumentation availability.
Links are provided to more information for each supported scenario.
