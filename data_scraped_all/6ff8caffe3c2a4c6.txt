GIS analysts, administrators, and editors connect to Azure Virtual Desktop via a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session. From there, ArcGIS Pro is accessed and takes advantage of the GPUs for light, medium, and heavy workflows.Lightrefers to a 2D workflow,mediumrefers to a more demanding 2D workflow, andheavyrefers to a 2D or 3D workflow that requires GPUs. GIS administrators can also use ArcGIS Pro to publish services and administer the enterprise geodatabase. Finally, GIS editors can maintain the vector and raster layers.Administrators can also make it possible to publish new versions of ArcGIS Pro by using semantic versioning. For example, as new versions of ArcGIS Pro are available, like ArcGIS Pro 3.0, the new version can be published in the Remote Desktop tool. As a result, users can pick that new version when they're ready to upgrade without having to perform the upgrade themselves. The GPU drivers can be included in the creation of the images that the deployments are based on.

Web GIS users can also take advantage of this solution by accessing ArcGIS Enterprise administrative interfaces either in the browser in the Azure Virtual Desktop RDP session or via their local browser (if ArcGIS is published as public facing). The Azure application gateway routes the traffic to the correct endpoint for the ArcGIS server roles. As with ArcGIS Pro, the latency between the browsers and the back end are minimized.

You can deploy the enterprise geodatabase in Azure SQL Managed Instance. ArcGIS Pro users can then create, manage, and edit the geodatabase from an RDP session. During the creation of the Azure Virtual Desktop image, administrators can include the ODBC drivers so users don't have to install them on the Azure Virtual Desktop VMs.

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)enables you to store directory data and make that data available to network users and administrators. AD DS stores information about user accounts, like names, passwords, and phone numbers, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access that information. This data store, also known as thedirectory, contains information about Active Directory objects. These objects typically include shared resources like servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts.Security is integrated with Active Directory through sign-in authentication and controlled access to objects in the directory. With a single network sign-in, administrators can manage directory data and organization throughout their network, and authorized network users can access resources anywhere on the network.

Alternatives
You can useArcGIS Enterprise Builderto set up a base ArcGIS Enterprise deployment on a single machine or multiple machines.
Although Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage are fine for many enterprises, Azure NetApp Files might be better suited for GIS because of large raster image files, Portal for ArcGIS items, shapefiles, lidar datasets, file geodatabases, and other geospatial data types that require fast access.
You can add other ArcGIS Enterprise server roles, like Raster Analytics Server, GeoAnalytics Server, GeoEvent Server, Knowledge Server, and Mission Server, to this base deployment as needed. You can also use newer technologies, like ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes, as a replacement for or supplement to ArcGIS Enterprise. GPU-based VMs for Drone2Map, CityEngine, and SURE for ArcGIS can also take advantage of these VMs. For more information, seeArcGIS Enterprise server roles.
To increase capacity, you can use multiple Azure subscriptions in a hub-and-spoke architecture and connect them via virtual network peering. Also, you can use Azure landing zones to lay down the initial services. For more information, seeWhat is an Azure landing zone?.
Scenario details
Esri's technology is a geographic information system (GIS) that contains capabilities for the visualization, analysis, and data management of geospatial data. Esri's core technology is calledthe ArcGIS platform. It includes capabilities for mapping, spatial analysis, 3D GIS, imagery and remote sensing, data collection and management, and field operations. For more information, see theArcGIS pageon the Esri website.
A desktop app calledArcGIS Prois a key part of the technology. It's a 64-bit professional desktop GIS. GIS analysts can use it to perform spatial analysis and edit spatial data. GIS administrators can use it to create and publish geospatial services.
Potential use cases
Esri's ArcGIS and virtual desktop solutions are frequently used for:
Security and regulation applications like utilities (energy), healthcare, and government.
Elastic workforce needs like remote work, mergers and acquisition, short-term employees, contractors, and partner access.
Employees like bring your own device (BYOD) users, mobile users, and branch workers.
Specialized workloads like land management (facilities and real estate), design and engineering, legacy apps, and software testing.
Although GIS has been implemented in Azure for many years, it has typically included only the back-end components. That implementation introduces latency between the client and server components. Organizations have been able to deploy desktop GIS on VMs from Azure Marketplace, but that deployment is for thick clients and isn't very scalable. This architecture addresses both challenges.
Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeWell-Architected Framework.
Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
Ideally, the latency between the end user and the RDP session needs to be around 200 ms or less. This latency helps to ensure that, when ArcGIS Pro users interact with maps and perform measurements or edits, the interactive edits and the tooltips appear quickly enough. TheAzure Virtual Desktop Experience Estimatorcan provide a quick assessment of connection round-trip time (RTT) from your location, through the Azure Virtual Desktop service, and to each Azure region in which you can deploy virtual machines.
When you use a remote Windows session, your network's available bandwidth greatly affects the quality of your experience. The following table lists the minimum recommended bandwidths for a smooth user experience. These recommendations are based on the guidelines inRemote Desktop workloads.
Keep in mind that the stress put on your network depends on both your app workload's output frame rate and your display resolution. If either the frame rate or display resolution increases, the bandwidth requirement also rises. For example, a light workload with a high-resolution display requires more available bandwidth than a light workload with regular or low resolution.
Ideally, all components in the preceding architecture diagram are deployed in a single region to minimize latency between components. However, for large organizations, a multi-region deployment is necessary and supported. Another component to consider isAzure Front Door, which routes users to the closest region.
Another significant benefit of this architecture is that the latency between it and Esri's SaaS offerings, like ArcGIS Velocity and ArcGIS Image, is also reduced for ArcGIS Pro users and web browser users. All components of the ArcGIS platform are in the cloud.
You can scale this architecture in many ways. You can scale the VMs for the back end or the desktops (both CPU and GPUs) in, out, up, or down. You can also deploy Azure Virtual Desktop on individual VMs or multi-session VMs. Azure Virtual Desktop can scale hundreds or thousands of VMs. For more information, seeWindows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session remote desktops.
You can test your system's latency by using theConnection Experience Indicator. You can useEsri's ArcGIS Pro Performance Assessment Toolto test the performance. Esri also recommendstools for testing ArcGIS Enterprise.Azure Load Testingcan also be helpful.
ArcGIS Pro virtual machine sizing guidelines for Azure Virtual Desktop and Remote Desktop Services
Whether you're running your session host virtual machines on Remote Desktop Services or Azure Virtual Desktop, different types of workloads require different virtual machine configurations. The examples in this article are generic guidelines, and you should only use them for initial performance estimates. For the best possible experience, optimize and scale your deployment depending on your users' needs.
ArcGIS Pro should use Windows 10 and Windows 11 multisession VMs to provide additional flexibility and greater return on investment. It is necessary to allocate the appropriate VM types to give each user enough resources such as GPU, CPU, and RAM. Always consider the number of connections and limit the simultaneous user access to each VM to avoid oversaturation and hindering performance.
Workloads
Users can run different types of workloads on the session host virtual machines. The following table shows examples of a range of workload types to help you estimate what size your virtual machines need to be. After you set up your virtual machines, continually monitor their actual usage and adjust their size accordingly. If you end up needing a bigger or smaller virtual machine, scale your existing deployment up or down.
The following table describes each ArcGIS workload.Example usersare the types of users that might find each workload most helpful.
Review theArcGIS Pro 3.3 system requirementsandArcGIS Pro on Microsoft Azure Cloudrecommendations to complement your sizing effort.
Single-session recommendations
Single-sessionscenarios are when there's only one user signed in to a session host virtual machine at any one time. For example, if you use personal host pools in Azure Virtual Desktop, you're using a single-session scenario.
The following table provides examples for single-session ArcGIS Pro scenarios:
Multi-session recommendations
Multi-sessionscenarios are when there's more than one user signed in to a session host at any one time. For example, when you use pooled host pools in Azure Virtual Desktop with the Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session operating system (OS), that's a multi-session deployment.
The following table provides examples for multi-session ArcGIS Pro scenarios:
