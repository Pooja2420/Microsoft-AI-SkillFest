In this article
Azure Monitor insights for Azure Cache for Redis provide a unified, interactive view of cache performance, failures, capacity, and operational health. This article shows you how to view Azure Cache for Redis insights across all of your subscriptions, and how to modify and adapt insights to fit the unique needs of your organization.
For more information about Azure Monitor for Azure Cache for Redis, seeMonitor Azure Cache for Redis. For a full list of the metric definitions that form these insights, seeSupported metrics for Microsoft.Cache.

Workbooks
Azure Cache for Redis insights are based on theworkbooks feature of Azure Monitorthat provides rich visualizations for metrics and other data. Azure Cache for Redis insights provides two workbooks by default:

Azure Cache For Redis Resource Overviewcombines many of the most commonly used metrics so that the health and performance of the cache instance can be viewed at a glance.

Geo-Replication Dashboardpulls geo-replication health and status metrics from both the geo-primary and geo-secondary cache instances to give a complete picture of geo-replication health. Using this dashboard is recommended, as some geo-replication metrics are only emitted from either the geo-primary or geo-secondary.

Overview
OnOverview, the table displays interactive Azure Cache for Redis metrics. You can filter the results based on the options you select from the following drop-down lists:
Subscriptions: Only subscriptions that have an Azure Cache for Redis resource are listed.

There's a counter tile under the drop-down lists. The tile shows the total number of Azure Cache for Redis resources in the selected subscriptions. Conditional color codes or heat maps for workbook columns report transaction metrics. The deepest color represents the highest value. Lighter colors represent lower values.
Selecting a drop-down list arrow next to one of the Azure Cache for Redis resources reveals a breakdown of the performance metrics at the individual resource level.

When you select the Azure Cache for Redis resource name highlighted in blue, you see the defaultOverviewtable for the associated account. It shows these columns:
Used Memory
Used Memory Percentage
Server Load
Server Load Timeline
CPU
Connected Clients
Cache Misses
Errors (Max)
Operations
When you selectOperationsat the top of the page, theOperationstable of the workbook template opens. It shows these columns:
