Warning
Virtual Network Injection will be retired for Azure Data Explorer by 1 February 2025. For more information on the deprecation, seeDeprecation of Virtual Network Injection for Azure Data Explorer.
In this section you learn how to troubleshoot connectivity, operational, and cluster creation issues for a cluster that is deployed into yourVirtual Network.
Access issues
If you have an issue while accessing cluster using the public (cluster.region.kusto.windows.net) or private (private-cluster.region.kusto.windows.net) endpoint and you suspect it's related to virtual network setup, perform the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.
Check TCP connectivity
The first step includes checking TCP connectivity using Windows or Linux OS.
Windows
Linux
DownloadTCpingto the machine connecting to the cluster.
DownloadTCpingto the machine connecting to the cluster.
Ping the destination from the source machine by using the following command:C:\> tcping -t yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
** Pinging continuously.  Press control-c to stop **
Probing 1.2.3.4:443/tcp - Port is open - time=100.00ms
Ping the destination from the source machine by using the following command:
C:\> tcping -t yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
** Pinging continuously.  Press control-c to stop **
Probing 1.2.3.4:443/tcp - Port is open - time=100.00ms
C:\> tcping -t yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
** Pinging continuously.  Press control-c to stop **
Probing 1.2.3.4:443/tcp - Port is open - time=100.00ms

apt-get install netcat
apt-get install netcat
Ping the destination from the source machine by using the following command:$ netcat -z -v yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
Connection to yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443 port [tcp/https] succeeded!
Ping the destination from the source machine by using the following command:
$ netcat -z -v yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
Connection to yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443 port [tcp/https] succeeded!
$ netcat -z -v yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443
Connection to yourcluster.kusto.windows.net 443 port [tcp/https] succeeded!
If the test isn't successful, proceed with the following steps. If the test is successful, the issue isn't due to a TCP connectivity issue. Go tooperational issuesto troubleshoot further.
Check Network Security Group (NSG) rules
Check that theNSGattached to the cluster's subnet, has an inbound rule that allows access from the client machine's IP for port 443.
Check the route table is configured to prevent access issues
If the cluster's subnet is configured to force tunnel all internet-bound traffic back to your firewall (subnet with aroute tablethat contains the default route '0.0.0.0/0'), make sure that the machine IP address has a route withnext hop typeto VirtualNetwork/Internet. This route is required to prevent asymmetric route issues.
Ingestion issues
If you're experiencing ingestion issues and you suspect it's related to virtual network setup, perform the following steps.
Check ingestion health
Check that thecluster ingestion metricsindicate a healthy state.
Check security rules on data source resources
If the metrics indicate that no events were processed from the data source (Events processedmetric for Event/IoT Hubs), make sure that the data source resources (Event Hubs or Storage) allow access from cluster's subnet in the firewall rules or service endpoints.
Check security rules configured on cluster's subnet
Make sure cluster's subnet has NSG, UDR, and firewall rules are properly configured. In addition, test network connectivity for all dependent endpoints.
Cluster creation and operations issues
If you're experiencing cluster creation or operation issues and you suspect it's related to virtual network setup, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.
Check the "DNS servers" configuration
Setting up Private Endpoint requires configuring DNS, We support Azure Private DNS zone setup only. Custom DNS server setup isn't support, check that the records that were created as part of private endpoint are registered to Azure Private DNS zone.
Diagnose the virtual network with the REST API
TheARMClientis used to call the REST API using PowerShell.

If theFindingsproperty shows an empty result, it means that all network tests passed and no connections are broken. If the following error is shown,Outbound dependency '{dependencyName}:{port}' might be not satisfied (Outbound), the cluster can't reach the dependent service endpoints. Proceed with the following steps.
Check NSG rules
Make sure that theNSGis configured properly per the instructions inConfigure Network Security Group rules.
Check the route table is configured to prevent ingestion issues
If the cluster's subnet is configured to force tunnel all internet-bound traffic back to your firewall (subnet with aroute tablethat contains the default route '0.0.0.0/0') make sure that themanagement IP addresses) andhealth monitoring IP addresseshave a route withnext hop typeInternet, andsource address prefixto'management-ip/32'and'health-monitoring-ip/32'. This route required to prevent asymmetric route issues.
Check firewall rules
If you force tunnel subnet outbound traffic to a firewall, make sure all dependencies FQDN (for example,.blob.core.windows.net) are allowed in the firewall configuration as described insecuring outbound traffic with firewall.
Cluster suspension issues
If the cluster fails to suspend, confirm that there aren't any locks on the networking resources in your subscription.
