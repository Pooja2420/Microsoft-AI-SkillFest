Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) will be retired onSeptember 30, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by September 30, 2027. For more information, seeAzure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) retirement.
Azure CDN from Edgio was retired onJanuary 15, 2025. For more information, seeAzure CDN from Edgio retirement FAQ.
In this quickstart, you enableAzure Content Delivery Networkto cache content from Azure Storage. Azure Content Delivery Network offers developers a global solution for delivering high-bandwidth content. It can cache blobs and static content of compute instances at physical nodes in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.
Note
Azure Content Delivery Network provides permanent access to Azure Storage resources and removing access requires manual steps.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Sign in to the Azure portal
Sign in to theAzure portalwith your Azure account.
Create a storage account
A storage account gives access to Azure Storage services. The storage account represents the highest level of the namespace for accessing each of the Azure Storage service components: Azure Blob, Queue, and Table storage. Take note that Azure Files can be only accessed through SMB protocol and cannot be put directly behind an Azure CDN which only supports HTTP(80) and HTTPS(443) protocols. For more information, seeIntroduction to Microsoft Azure Storage.
To create a storage account, you must be either the service administrator or a coadministrator for the associated subscription.
In the Azure portal, selectCreate a resourceon the upper left. TheCreate a resourcepane appears.

In theCreate storage account pane, enter the following details:SettingValueResource groupSelectCreate newand use the nameCDNQuickstart-rg. You can also use an existing resource group if you prefer.Storage account nameEnter a name for the account using 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers only. The name must be unique across Azure, and becomes the host name in the URL that's used to address blob, queue, or table resources for the subscription. To address a container resource in Blob storage, use a URI in the following format: HTTP://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>.RegionSelect an Azure region near you from the dropdown list.Leave all other details set to the defaults, then selectReview + create.

Creating the storage account might take several minutes to complete. Once creation is complete, selectGo to resourceto open the storage account's page for the next step.

Enable Azure Content Delivery Network for the storage account
On the page for your storage account, selectSecurity + Networking>Front Door and CDNfrom the left menu. TheFront Door and CDNpage appears.

In theNew endpointsection, enter the following information:SettingValueService typeAzure Content Delivery NetworkCreate new/use existing profileCreate newProfile nameEnter your profile name, for example,cdn-profile-123. A profile is a collection of endpoints.content delivery network endpoint nameEnter your endpoint hostname, such ascdn-endpoint-123. This name must be globally unique across Azure because it's to access your cached resources at the URL<endpoint-name>.azureedge.net.Origin hostnameBy default, a new content delivery network endpoint uses the hostname of your storage account as the origin server.Pricing tierSelect one of the options, such asMicrosoft CDN (classic).
In theNew endpointsection, enter the following information:
SelectCreate. After the endpoint is created, it appears in the endpoint list.
SelectCreate. After the endpoint is created, it appears in the endpoint list.
Tip
If you want to specify advanced configuration settings for your content delivery network endpoint, such aslarge file download optimization, you can instead use theAzure Content Delivery Network extensionto create a content delivery network profile and endpoint.

Enable additional content delivery network features
From the storage accountAzure CDNpage, select the content delivery network endpoint from the list to open the content delivery network endpoint configuration page.
From this page, you can enable additional content delivery network features for your delivery, such ascompression,query string caching, andgeo filtering.
Enable SAS
If you want to grant limited access to private storage containers, you can use the Shared Access Signature (SAS) feature of your Azure Storage account. A SAS is a URI that grants restricted access rights to your Azure Storage resources without exposing your account key. For more information, seeUsing Azure Content Delivery Network with SAS.

Access content delivery network content
To access cached content on the content delivery network, use the content delivery network URL provided in the portal. The address for a cached blob has the following format:
HTTP://<endpoint-name>.azureedge.net/<myPublicContainer>/<BlobName>
Note
After you enable Azure Content Delivery Network access to a storage account, all publicly available objects are eligible for content delivery network POP caching. If you modify an object that's currently cached in the content delivery network, the new content will not be available via Azure Content Delivery Network until Azure Content Delivery Network refreshes its content after the time to live period for the cached content expires.

Remove content from Azure Content Delivery Network
If you no longer want to cache an object in Azure Content Delivery Network, you can take one of the following steps:
Make the container private instead of public. For more information, seeManage anonymous read access to containers and blobs.
Disable or delete the content delivery network endpoint by using the Azure portal.
Modify your hosted service to no longer respond to requests for the object.
An object that's already cached in Azure Content Delivery Network remains cached until the time to live period for the object expires or until the endpoint ispurged. When the time to live period expires, Azure Content Delivery Network determines whether the content delivery network endpoint is still valid and the object is still anonymously accessible. If they are not, the object will no longer be cached.
Clean up resources
In the preceding steps, you created a content delivery network profile and an endpoint in a resource group. Save these resources if you want to go toNext stepsand learn how to add a custom domain to your endpoint. However, if you don't expect to use these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group, thus avoiding additional charges:
From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, selectResource groupsand then selectCDNQuickstart-rg*.
