ExpressRoute provides a private and resilient connection between your on-premises networks and the Microsoft Cloud, allowing access to services like Azure and Microsoft 365 from your data center or corporate network. For instance, you might have a branch office in San Francisco with an ExpressRoute circuit in Silicon Valley, and another branch office in London with an ExpressRoute circuit there. Both offices can connect to Azure resources in US West and UK South, but they can't directly communicate with each other. For example, the 10.0.1.0/24 network can send data to the 10.0.3.0/24 and 10.0.4.0/24 networks, but not to the 10.0.2.0/24 network.

WithExpressRoute Global Reach, you can link ExpressRoute circuits to create a private network between your on-premises networks. In the previous example, with ExpressRoute Global Reach, your San Francisco office (10.0.1.0/24) can directly exchange data with your London office (10.0.2.0/24) through the existing ExpressRoute circuits and Microsoft's global network.

Use case
ExpressRoute Global Reach complements your service providerâs WAN implementation by connecting your branch offices worldwide. For example, if your service provider operates primarily in the United States and connects all your U.S. branches, but doesn't operate in Japan and Hong Kong SAR, you can use ExpressRoute Global Reach to work with a local service provider and Microsoft to connect your branches in Japan and Hong Kong SAR to branches in the U.S. using ExpressRoute and Microsoft's global network.
