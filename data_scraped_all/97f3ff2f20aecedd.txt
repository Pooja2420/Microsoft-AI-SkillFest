Applies to: Azure Local 2311.2 and later; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019
Windows Admin Center can be used to create and manage your virtual machines (VMs) on Azure Local.
Note
The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local is using theAzure Arc control plane. However, since the functionality described in this article isn't yet provided by Azure Arc, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described in this article. The VMs created this way aren't enabled by Azure Arc, have limited manageability from the Azure Arc control plane, and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, including usage of Azure Update Manager at no extra cost.
