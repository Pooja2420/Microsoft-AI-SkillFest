This article describes how you can create credentials in the Microsoft Purview Data Map. These saved credentials let you quickly reuse and apply saved authentication information to your data source scans.
Prerequisites
An Azure key vault. To learn how to create one, seeQuickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure portal.
Introduction
A credential is authentication information that Microsoft Purview can use to authenticate to your registered data sources. A credential object can be created for various types of authentication scenarios, such as Basic Authentication requiring username/password. Credential capture specific information required to authenticate, based on the chosen type of authentication method. Credentials use your existing Azure Key Vaults secrets for retrieving sensitive authentication information during the Credential creation process.
In Microsoft Purview, there are few options to use as authentication method to scan data sources such as the following options. Learn from eachdata source articlefor its supported authentication.
Microsoft Purview system-assigned managed identity
User-assigned managed identity(preview)
Account Key (usingKey Vault)
SQL Authentication (usingKey Vault)
Service Principal (usingKey Vault)
Consumer Key (usingKey Vault)
And more
Before creating any credentials, consider your data source types and networking requirements to decide which authentication method you need for your scenario.
Use Microsoft Purview system-assigned managed identity to set up scans
If you're using the Microsoft Purview system-assigned managed identity (SAMI) to set up scans, you won't need to create a credential and link your key vault to Microsoft Purview to store them. For detailed instructions on adding the Microsoft Purview SAMI to have access to scan your data sources, refer to the data source-specific authentication sections below:
Azure Blob Storage
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
Azure SQL Database
Azure SQL Managed Instance
Azure Synapse Workspace
Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW)
Grant Microsoft Purview access to your Azure Key Vault
To give Microsoft Purview access to your Azure Key Vault, there are two things you'll need to confirm:
Firewall access to the Azure Key Vault
Microsoft Purview permissions on the Azure Key Vault
Firewall access to Azure Key Vault
If your Azure Key Vault has disabled public network access, you have two options to allow access for Microsoft Purview.
Trusted Microsoft services
Private endpoint connections
Microsoft Purview is listed as one ofAzure Key Vault's trusted services, so if public network access is disabled on your Azure Key Vault you can enable access only to trusted Microsoft services, and Microsoft Purview will be included.
You can enable this setting in your Azure Key Vault under theNetworkingtab.
At the bottom of the page, under Exception, enable theAllow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewallfeature.

To connect to Azure Key Vault with private endpoints, followAzure Key Vault's private endpoint documentation.
Note
Private endpoint connection option is supported when using Azure integration runtime inmanaged virtual networkto scan the data sources. For self-hosted integration runtime, you need to enabletrusted Microsoft services.
Microsoft Purview permissions on the Azure Key Vault
Currently Azure Key Vault supports two permission models:
Option 1 - Access Policies
Option 2 - Role-based Access Control
Before assigning access to the Microsoft Purview system-assigned managed identity (SAMI), first identify your Azure Key Vault permission model from Key Vault resourceAccess Policiesin the menu. Follow steps below based on relevant the permission model.

Follow these steps only if permission model in your Azure Key Vault resource is set toVault Access Policy:
Navigate to your Azure Key Vault.

Create Azure Key Vaults connections in your Microsoft Purview account
Before you can create a Credential, first associate one or more of your existing Azure Key Vault instances with your Microsoft Purview account.
If you're using theclassic Microsoft Purview portal, navigate to theManagement Centerin the studio and then navigate toCredentials. If you're using thenew Microsoft Purview portalopen theData mapsolution, select theSource managementdrop-down, and then selectCredentials.

Create a new credential
These credential types are supported in Microsoft Purview:
Basic authentication: You add thepasswordas a secret in key vault.
Service Principal: You add theservice principal keyas a secret in key vault.
SQL authentication: You add thepasswordas a secret in key vault.
Windows authentication: You add thepasswordas a secret in key vault.
Account Key: You add theaccount keyas a secret in key vault.
Role ARN: For an Amazon S3 data source, add yourrole ARNin AWS.
Consumer Key: For Salesforce data sources, you can add thepasswordand theconsumer secretin key vault.
User-assigned managed identity (preview): You can add user-assigned managed identity credentials. For more information, see thecreate a user-assigned managed identity sectionbelow.

Create a user-assigned managed identity
User-assigned managed identities (UAMI) enable Azure resources to authenticate directly with other resources using Microsoft Entra authentication, without the need to manage those credentials. They allow you to authenticate and assign access just like you would with a system assigned managed identity, Microsoft Entra user, Microsoft Entra group, or service principal. User-assigned managed identities are created as their own resource (rather than being connected to a preexisting resource). For more information about managed identities, see themanaged identities for Azure resources documentation.
The following steps explain how to create a UAMI for Microsoft Purview to use.
Supported data sources for UAMI
