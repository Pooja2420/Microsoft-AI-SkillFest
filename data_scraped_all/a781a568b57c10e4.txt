The product backlog is your project plan, which shows what your team intends to deliver. It contains user stories, backlog items, or requirements that you add to it. Your backlog is a flat list of work items, as the following image illustrates, which shows a Scrum process for Azure Boards. For the Agile, Basic, and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) process models, theBacklog itemsselection appears asStories,Issues, andRequirements.

Prerequisites
Add a backlog
If you have a project, you have a backlog. Your backlog contains a list of features and requirements that you want to build, ordered by priority. By default, each project has a team and a set of backlogs for that team. You can add more backlogs if you need to support more teams. When you create a new team, you also create various team assets that a team admin can customize to suit the team's workflow. To add a set of backlogs to support a new team, seeCreate or add a team.
Each team's set of backlogs is associated with one or more work item types. The work item type associated with a backlog depends on the process selected at project creation, team configurations, and process customizations.
The backlogs defined for each default process are:
Agile:Stories,Features, andEpics
Basic:IssuesandEpics
Scrum:Backlog items,Features, andEpics
CMMI:Requirements,Features, andEpics
To customize your backlogs with custom work item types, add portfolio backlogs, or other supported options, seeInherited process modelorOn-premises XML process model.
Open your backlog
From your web browser, do the following steps to open your product backlog.
Sign in to your project (https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}/{Your_Project}).

To select a different backlog, choose a different team or select theView Backlog directoryoption. You can also enter a keyword in the search box to filter the team backlogs for the project.

Tip
Choose thestar icon to favorite a team backlog. Favorited artifacts (favorited icon) appear at the top of the team selector list.
Check that you selectedStories(for Agile),Issues(for Basic),Backlog items(for Scrum), orRequirements(for CMMI) as the backlog level.

Tip
Each team member has several tools to configure their backlog view:Expand/Collapse one level,Column Options,Backlog level selector,View options, andFiltertoolbar. Options set for each backlog level are distinct and persist until changed. For more information, seeConfigure your backlog view.
Track bugs on your backlog
Some teams like to track bugs along with requirements on the backlog. Other teams like to track bugs as tasks completed in support of a requirement, so bugs appear on theirTaskboard. Before you determine how to manage bugs, seeBugs as requirements or tasksandShow bugs on backlogs and boards.

Convert ideas into backlog items
Your backlog shows work that you plan to do or that's in progress. As soon as theStateof a work item is set toDoneorCompleted, the work item doesn't appear on your backlog. You can use thebacklog controlsto filter or change your view.
If you already defined a long list of items, you don't have to reenter them one at a time. Instead, usebulk work items with CSV filesorMicrosoft Excelto import them to your backlog.
Before you add work items, selectView optionsand turn the slider forParentsandForecastingtoOff. Optionally, turnIn Progress Itemson or off.

To add a work item, selectNew Work Itemand enter a title. SelectEnteror selectAdd to top. Work items are assigned the defaultArea PathandIteration Pathselected for the team. For more information, seeManage and configure team tools.NoteIf you haveStakeholderaccess, you can only add work items to the bottom of the backlog. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.

Note
If you haveStakeholderaccess, you can only add work items to the bottom of the backlog. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.
Depending on whether you create your project withBasic,Agile,Scrum, orCMMI, the items in your backlog might be called issues, user stories, PBIs, or requirements. All of these terms describe the customer value to be delivered and the work to be performed.
By default, user stories appear on Agile backlogs, issues on Basic backlogs, PBIs and bugs appear on Scrum backlogs, and requirements appear on CMMI backlogs.

Reorder your backlog
Reorder your items to create a prioritized list of work. Review and prioritize your backlog frequently to help your team know what's most important to deliver next.
You can't sort your backlog on a column. To view a sorted listed, selectCreate query. Save and open the query, and sort the query results. For more information about queries, seeUse the query editor to list and manage queries.
To reorder your backlog, drag the work items. Or, if you prefer to use the keyboard, hold down the Alt key and use the up and down arrows.

Note
To reorder a backlog, have at least Basic access. If you have Stakeholder access, you can't reorder backlog items. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.
Backlogs that participate in portfolio management or that contain nested same-type child items might not allow you to reorder the items. For more information, see these articles:
Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items
Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues

Add details and estimates to backlog items
Building and prioritizing your backlog provides a high-level roadmap. Before your team can start work on any item, however, they need more details. Capture the details within the work item form.
To open each item, double-click or selectEnter. Add all the information you want to track. Change one or more field values, add a description, or make a note in theDiscussionsection. You can also choose theAttachmentstab and drag a file onto it to share the file with others.
Enter as much detail as the team needs to do the following tasks:
Understand the scope
Estimate the work required
Develop tests
Ensure that the end product meets acceptance criteria
Note
You can only assign work to a single user. If you need to assign work to more than one user, add a work item for each user and distinguish the work to be done by title and description. The Assigned To field only accepts user accounts that have beenadded to a project or team.

To plan a sprint, at a minimum, estimate the effort involved to implement each backlog item. To capture effort in the work item form, useEffortfor Basic or Scrum,Story Pointsfor Agile, orSizefor CMMI.

Field
Usage
Effort,Story Points,Size
Provide a relative estimate of the amount of work required to complete a PBI. For user stories and requirements, you capture estimates inStory PointsandSize.
Most Agile methods recommend that you set estimates for backlog items based on relative size of work. Such methods include powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) and the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on). Use any numeric unit of measurement your team prefers.
The estimates you set forEffort,Size, orStory Pointsare used to calculatevelocityandforecast sprints.
Business Value
Specify a priority that captures the relative value of a PBI compared to other PBIs. The higher the number, the greater the business value.
Use this field when you want to capture a priority separate from the changeable backlog stack ranking.
Description
Provide enough detail to create shared understanding of scope and support estimation efforts. Focus on the user, what they want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how to develop the product. Do provide sufficient details so that your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.
Acceptance Criteria
Define whatDonemeans by describing the criteria for the team to use to verify whether the PBI or the bug fix is fully implemented.
Before work begins on a PBI or bug, describe the criteria for customer acceptance as clearly as possible. To determine the acceptance criteria, have conversations between the team and customers. These criteria help ensure a common understanding within the team to meet customer expectations. Also, this information provides the basis for acceptance testing.
Impact Assessment(CMMI only)
Describes the customer impact of not implementing the requirement. You might include details from the Kano model about whether this requirement is in the surprise, required, or obvious categories.

Show or hide In Progress Items
From theView optionsselector, you can turn onIn Progress Items. If you turn it off, items that are in theActive,Committed, orResolvedstates or states that map to theIn Progress category statedon't appear in the backlog.

You'd likely choose to hideIn Progress itemswhen you want to forecast work. For more information, seeForecast your product backlog.

Show or hide work items in Completed state
From theView optionsselector, you can choose to show or hideCompleted Child items.

Choose to show Completed child items when you want toview rollup columns.
Choose to hide Completed child items when you want to forecast work. For more information, seeForecast your product backlog.
Note
Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after theirChanged Datevalue is greater than 183 days (about a half a year). You can still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.
Note
Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after theirChanged Datevalue is greater than a year old. You can still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.
Your product backlog is one of three classes of backlogs available to you,backlogs,boards, andplans. If you don't see the work items you expect on your backlog, seeSet up your backlogs and boards.
Next steps
With your backlog in place, your team can begin work on the top-priority items. Now it's time to decide how you want to work as a team. Do you want to use Scrum or Kanban? You can use these methods independently or together.
Scrum: Schedule sprintsorKanban
Teams who want the least overhead for tracking and estimating might prefer Kanban. Teams who like to work at a steady cadence and plot the details of their sprint plan might prefer Scrum and sprint planning.
