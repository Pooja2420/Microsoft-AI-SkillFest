This article provides business practices that you can implement to manage and monitor Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure with Oracle Database@Azure. Implement these considerations when you create your overall design and when you onboard this service within your Azure enterprise landing zone.
Design considerations
Consider these key topics before you deploy Oracle Database@Azure and Exadata Database services.
Identify the Azure region where you want to deploy your Oracle Database@Azure and Exadata Database services. Ensure that this region aligns with your current or future Azure landing zone. If the region that you choose differs from your current deployment region, assess whether your existing monitoring tools can extend their capabilities to this new region. Ensure seamless integration and functionality across regions.

Consider your network plan before you deploy your resources. You deploy Oracle Exadata Database resources to a private subnet that isn't accessible from either on-premises or spoke virtual networks without deploying a network virtual appliance (NVA). An NVA isn't a traditional firewall. An NVA is a Linux virtual machine (VM) with a user-defined route that provides the next hop IP address and customiptables. You must deploy iptables if you have an on-premises enterprise monitoring solution.

Familiarize yourself with network constraints. The subnets that you deploy within a virtual network and that are associated with Oracle Exadata Database clusters are delegated private subnets. Delegated subnets don't allow network communication outside of the virtual network without deploying an NVA. For more information, seeNetwork planning constraints.

Choose a network topology that best supports your migration method of choice when you create your network plan. Your migration method should monitor the process when you move your critical data. Options for migration include Oracle Recovery Manager, Oracle Data Guard, Oracle Data Pump, or a Linux VM that has the Network File System role installed. Consult with your Oracle and Microsoft representative for detailed guidance.

Design recommendations
Consider these recommendations before you deploy Oracle Database@Azure and Exadata Database services.
Monitor for health and performance
You should collect quantitative metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, storage usage, database operations, SQL queries, and overall transactions. You can use Azure Monitor metrics, or your monitoring tool of choice, to diagnose and proactively troubleshoot problems. The collection and review of database metrics helps to ensure operational readiness and long-term sustainment.
Create a custom dashboard in the Azure portal with an aggregated view of the various metrics collected. For more information, seeCreate a dashboard in the Azure portal.

Monitor key metrics
The following table contains initial recommended settings for Oracle Cloud Database metrics. You can add counters based on your organization's needs. Set each monitoring setting against all the available nodes in the cluster. In Azure Monitor, you can't select multiple objects at the same time when you add metrics. To enter specified settings, you must select each Exadata cluster node.
Set alerts in your monitoring solution for critical workloads. If you use Azure Monitor, you can createaction groups.
For more information, seeOracle Cloud Database metrics.
