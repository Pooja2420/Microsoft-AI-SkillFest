If you have existing Windows virtual machines (VMs) that use unmanaged disks, you can migrate the VMs to use managed disks through theAzure Managed Disksservice. This process converts both the operating system (OS) disk and any attached data disks.

During the migration, you deallocate the VM. The VM receives a new IP address when it's started after the migration. If needed, you canassign a static IP addressto the VM.

The original VHDs and the storage account used by the VM before migration are not deleted. They continue to incur charges. To avoid being billed for these artifacts, delete the original VHD blobs after you verify that the migration is complete. If you need to find these unattached disks in order to delete them, see our articleFind and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks.
Migrate single-instance VMs
This section covers how to migrate single-instance Azure VMs from unmanaged disks to managed disks. (If your VMs are in an availability set, see the next section.)
Deallocate the VM by using theStop-AzVMcmdlet. The following example deallocates the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$vmName = "myVM"
Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Force
Deallocate the VM by using theStop-AzVMcmdlet. The following example deallocates the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
myVM
myResourceGroup
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$vmName = "myVM"
Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Force
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$vmName = "myVM"
Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Force
Migrate the VM to managed disks by using theConvertTo-AzVMManagedDiskcmdlet. The following process converts the previous VM, including the OS disk and any data disks, and starts the Virtual Machine:ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vmName

ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vmName
ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vmName
Migrate VMs in an availability set
If the VMs that you want to migrate to managed disks are in an availability set, you first need to migrate the availability set to a managed availability set.
Migrate the availability set by using theUpdate-AzAvailabilitySetcmdlet. The following example updates the availability set namedmyAvailabilitySetin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:$rgName = 'myResourceGroup'
$avSetName = 'myAvailabilitySet'

$avSet = Get-AzAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $avSetName
Update-AzAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku AlignedIf the region where your availability set is located has only 2 managed fault domains but the number of unmanaged fault domains is 3, this command shows an error similar to "The specified fault domain count 3 must fall in the range 1 to 2." To resolve the error, update the fault domain to 2 and updateSkutoAlignedas follows:$avSet.PlatformFaultDomainCount = 2
Update-AzAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned
Migrate the availability set by using theUpdate-AzAvailabilitySetcmdlet. The following example updates the availability set namedmyAvailabilitySetin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
myAvailabilitySet
myResourceGroup
$rgName = 'myResourceGroup'
$avSetName = 'myAvailabilitySet'

$avSet = Get-AzAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $avSetName
Update-AzAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned
$rgName = 'myResourceGroup'
$avSetName = 'myAvailabilitySet'

$avSet = Get-AzAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $avSetName
Update-AzAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned
If the region where your availability set is located has only 2 managed fault domains but the number of unmanaged fault domains is 3, this command shows an error similar to "The specified fault domain count 3 must fall in the range 1 to 2." To resolve the error, update the fault domain to 2 and updateSkutoAlignedas follows:
Sku
Aligned
$avSet.PlatformFaultDomainCount = 2
Update-AzAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned
$avSet.PlatformFaultDomainCount = 2
Update-AzAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned
Deallocate and migrate the VMs in the availability set. The following script deallocates each VM by using theStop-AzVMcmdlet, converts it by usingConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk, and restarts it automatically as apart of the migration process:$avSet = Get-AzAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $avSetName

foreach($vmInfo in $avSet.VirtualMachinesReferences)
{
  $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $vmInfo.id}
  Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vm.Name -Force
  ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vm.Name
}

  Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vm.Name -Force
  ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vm.Name
}
$avSet = Get-AzAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $avSetName

foreach($vmInfo in $avSet.VirtualMachinesReferences)
{
  $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $vmInfo.id}
  Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vm.Name -Force
  ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vm.Name
}
Troubleshooting
Before converting, make sure all the VM extensions are in the 'Provisioning succeeded' state or the migration will fail with the error code 409.
If there is an error during migration, or if a VM is in a failed state because of issues in a previous migration, run theConvertTo-AzVMManagedDiskcmdlet again. A simple retry usually unblocks the situation.
ConvertTo-AzVMManagedDisk
If you are converting a Linux VM to managed disks, use the latest version of the Azure Linux Agent. Operations using Azure Linux Agent versions '2.2.0' and earlier will likely fail. Running the migration on a generalized VM or a VM that belongs to a classic availability set is also not supported.
If the migration fails with the "SnapshotCountExceeded" error, delete some snapshots and attempt the operation again.
Migrate using the Azure portal
You can also migrate unmanaged disks to managed disks using the Azure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Select the VM from the list of VMs in the portal.
In the blade for the VM, selectDisksfrom the menu.
At the top of theDisksblade, selectMigrate to managed disks.
If your VM is in an availability set, there will be a warning on theMigrate to managed disksblade that you need to migrate the availability set first. The warning should have a link you can click to migrate the availability set. Once the availability set is converted or if your VM is not in an availability set, clickMigrateto start the process of migrating your disks to managed disks.
The VM will be stopped and restarted after migration is complete.
Next steps
Change the disk type of an Azure managed disk.
Take a read-only copy of a VM by usingsnapshots.
