In YAML pipelines, it's hard to tell what is the state of your system.
For example, you can't easily see what is the latest pipeline run that executed a particular stage.
This limitation makes debugging the system more difficult.
In YAML pipelines, it's also difficult to reason what changes are going to be deployed in a particular stage.
We plan to give you the ability to see a stage-focused view of all the runs of a pipeline, so you can say that pipeline run#123was the last one to run in stageDeploy WUS1.
#123
Deploy WUS1
