The Azure landing zonesImplementation optionssection of the Cloud Adoption Framework is undergoing a freshness update.
As part of this update, we will be revising the table of contents and article content, which will include a combination of refactoring and consolidation of several articles. An update will be posted on this page once the work is completed.
Visit the new"Deployment options" section of the Azure Architecture Centerfor the latest Azure landing zone implementation content, including platform and application landing zones.
Does your business require an initial implementation of landing zones? And do these landing zones need fully integrated governance, security, and an operations control plane from the start? With the following examples, you can use the Azure portal or infrastructure as code to set up and configure your Azure environment. It's also possible to transition between the portal and infrastructure as code (recommended) when your organization is ready.
Reference implementation
The following table lists example reference implementations based on the recommended enterprise-scale architecture.
Each reference implementation deploys platform resources to the selected target environment. Deployment details and an overview of the deployed resources can be found using the GitHub link in the table above.
Next steps
These examples provide an easy deployment option to support continued learning for the enterprise-scale approach. Before you use these examples in a production version of enterprise-scale, review the enterprise-scale architecture.
