Back up SAP HANA System Replication databases on Azure VMs

In this article
SAP HANA databases are critical workloads that require a low recovery-point objective (RPO) and long-term retention. This article describes how you can back up SAP HANA databases that are running on Azure virtual machines (VMs) to an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault by usingAzure Backup.
You can also switch the protection of SAP HANA database on Azure VM (standalone) on Azure Backup to HSR.Learn more.
Note
The support forHSR + DRscenario is currently not available because there is a restriction to have VM and Vault in the same region. To enable the backup operation of a Third Node that is in a different region, you need to configure the backup in a different vault as a standalone node.
For more information about the supported configurations and scenarios, seeSAP HANA backup support matrix.
Prerequisites
Before you back up SAP HANA System Replication database on Azure VMs, ensure that:
Identify/create a Recovery Services vault in the same region and subscription as the two VMs/nodes of the HANA System Replication (HSR) database.
Allow connectivity from each of the VMs/nodes to the internet for communication with Azure.
Run the preregistration script on both VMs or nodes that are part of HANA System Replication (HSR). You can download the latest preregistration scriptfrom here. You can also download it from the link underRecovery Services vault>Backup>Discover DBs in VMs>Start Discovery.
Important
Ensure that the combined length of the SAP HANA Server VM name and the resource group name doesn't exceed 84 characters for Azure Resource Manager VMs and 77 characters for classic VMs. This limitation is because some characters are reserved by the service.
Create a Recovery Services vault
A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points that are created over time, and it provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies.
To create a Recovery Services vault:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forBusiness Continuity Center, and then go to theBusiness Continuity Centerdashboard.
Search forBusiness Continuity Center, and then go to theBusiness Continuity Centerdashboard.

On theVaultpane, select+Vault.

SelectRecovery Services vault>Continue.
SelectRecovery Services vault>Continue.

On theRecovery Services vaultpane, enter the following values:Subscription: Select the subscription to use. If you're a member of only one subscription, you'll see that name. If you're not sure which subscription to use, use the default subscription. There are multiple choices only if your work or school account is associated with more than one Azure subscription.Resource group: Use an existing resource group or create a new one. To view a list of available resource groups in your subscription, selectUse existing, and then select a resource in the dropdown list. To create a new resource group, selectCreate new, and then enter the name. For more information about resource groups, seeAzure Resource Manager overview.Vault name: Enter a friendly name to identify the vault. The name must be unique to the Azure subscription. Specify a name that has at least 2 but not more than 50 characters. The name must start with a letter and consist only of letters, numbers, and hyphens.Region: Select the geographic region for the vault. For you to create a vault to help protect any data source, the vaultmustbe in the same region as the data source.ImportantIf you're not sure of the location of your data source, close the window. Go to the list of your resources in the portal. If you have data sources in multiple regions, create a Recovery Services vault for each region. Create the vault in the first location before you create a vault in another location. There's no need to specify storage accounts to store the backup data. The Recovery Services vault and Azure Backup handle that automatically.

Note
Azure Backup now supports immutable vaults that help you ensure that recovery points once created can't be deleted before their expiry as per the backup policy. You can make the immutability irreversible for maximum protection to your backup data from various threats, including ransomware attacks and malicious actors.Learn more.
Run the preregistration script
When a failover occurs, the users are replicated to the new primary, buthdbuserstoreisn't replicated. So, you need to create the same key in all nodes of the HSR setup, which allows the Azure Backup service to connect to any new primary node automatically, without any manual intervention.

Provide a unique HSR ID as input to the script:-hn HSR_UNIQUE_VALUEor--hsr-unique-value HSR_Unique_Value.You must provide the same HSR ID on both VMs/nodes. This ID must be unique within a vault. It should be an alphanumeric value containing at least one digit, one lowercase letter, and one uppercase character, and it should contain from 6 to 35 characters.Example:- ./script.sh -sk SYSTEMKEY -bk USRBKP -hn HSRlab001 -p 39013

While you're running the preregistration script on the secondary node, you must specify the SDC/MDC port as input. This is because SQL commands to identify the SDC/MDC setup can't be run on the secondary node.

Run the SAP HANA backup configuration script (preregistration script) in the VMs where HANA is installed as the root user. This script sets up the HANA system for backup. For more information about the script actions, see theWhat the preregistration script doessection.There's no HANA-generated unique ID for an HSR setup. So, you need to provide a unique ID that helps the backup service to group all nodes of an HSR as a single data source.

Create a backup policy
A backup policy defines the backup schedules and the backup retention duration.
Note
A policy is created at the vault level.
Multiple vaults can use the same backup policy, but you must apply the backup policy to each vault.
Azure Backup doesnât automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes when you're backing up an SAP HANA database that's running in an Azure VM. Modify the policy manually as needed.
To configure the policy settings, follow these steps:
