Deployment groupsin Classic pipelines make it easy to define groups of target servers for deployment. Tasks that you define in a deployment group job run on some or all of the target servers, depending on the arguments you specify for the tasks and the job itself.
You can select specific sets of servers from a deployment group to receive the deployment by specifying the machine tags that you've defined for each server in the deployment group. You can also specify the proportion of the target servers that the pipeline should deploy to at the same time. This ensures that the app running on these servers is capable of handling requests while the deployment is taking place.
If you're using a YAML pipeline, you should useEnvironmentswithvirtual machinesinstead.

Note
Deployment group jobs are not supported in YAML. You can useVirtual machine resources in Environmentsto do a rolling deployment to VMs in YAML pipelines.
Rolling deployments can be configured by specifying the keywordrolling:understrategy:node of adeployment job.

YAML builds aren't available.
You add a deployment group job in the editor by selecting '...' onProcesschannel in theTaskstab of a release pipeline. The properties for the deployment group job are displayed when you select the job in the editor.
Note
Deployment group jobs can only be used in release pipelines. They cannot be used in build pipelines.
Timeouts
Use the job timeout to specify the timeout in minutes for jobs in this job. A zero
value for this option means that the timeout is effectively infinite and so, by default, jobs run until they complete or fail.
You can also set the timeout for each task individually - seetask control options. Jobs targeting Microsoft-hosted agents haveadditional restrictionson how long they may run.
