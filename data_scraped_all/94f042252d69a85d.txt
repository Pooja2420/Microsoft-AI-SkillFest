Multifactor authentication is a process in which a user is prompted for additional forms of identification during a sign-in event. For example, the prompt could be to enter a code on their cellphone or to provide a fingerprint scan. When you require a second form of identification, security is increased because this additional factor isn't easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.
Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and Conditional Access policies give you the flexibility to require MFA from users for specific sign-in events.
Important
This tutorial shows an administrator how to enable Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. To step through the multifactor authentication as a user, seeSign in to your work or school account using your two-step verification method.
If your IT team hasn't enabled the ability to use Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, or if you have problems during sign-in, reach out to your Help desk for additional assistance.
In this tutorial you learn how to:
Create a Conditional Access policy to enable Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for a group of users.
Configure the policy conditions that prompt for MFA.
Test configuring and using multifactor authentication as a user.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:
A working Microsoft Entra tenant with Microsoft Entra ID P1 or trial licenses enabled.If you need to,create one for free.

An account with at least theConditional Access Administratorrole. Some MFA settings can also be managed by anAuthentication Policy Administrator.

A non-administrator account with a password that you know. For this tutorial, we created such an account, namedtestuser. In this tutorial, you test the end-user experience of configuring and using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.If you need information about creating a user account, seeAdd or delete users using Microsoft Entra ID.

Create a Conditional Access policy
The recommended way to enable and use Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication is with Conditional Access policies. Conditional Access lets you create and define policies that react to sign-in events and that request additional actions before a user is granted access to an application or service.

Conditional Access policies can be applied to specific users, groups, and apps. The goal is to protect your organization while also providing the right levels of access to the users who need it.
In this tutorial, we create a basic Conditional Access policy to prompt for MFA when a user signs in. In a later tutorial in this series, we configure Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication by using a risk-based Conditional Access policy.
First, create a Conditional Access policy and assign your test group of users as follows:
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aConditional Access Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Conditional Access> Overview , select+ Create new policy.

Enter a name for the policy, such asMFA Pilot.
Enter a name for the policy, such asMFA Pilot.
UnderAssignments, select the current value underUsers or workload identities.

Browse for and select your Microsoft Entra group, such asMFA-Test-Group, then chooseSelect.
Browse for and select your Microsoft Entra group, such asMFA-Test-Group, then chooseSelect.

We've selected the group to apply the policy to. In the next section, we configure the conditions under which to apply the policy.

Configure the conditions for multifactor authentication
Now that the Conditional Access policy is created and a test group of users is assigned, define the cloud apps or actions that trigger the policy. These cloud apps or actions are the scenarios that you decide require additional processing, such as prompting for multifactor authentication. For example, you could decide that access to a financial application or use of management tools require an additional prompt for authentication.

Configure which apps require multifactor authentication
For this tutorial, configure the Conditional Access policy to require multifactor authentication when a user signs in.
Select the current value underCloud apps or actions, and then underSelect what this policy applies to, verify thatCloud appsis selected.

To provide flexibility, you can also exclude certain apps from the policy.

Configure multifactor authentication for access
Next, we configure access controls. Access controls let you define the requirements for a user to be granted access. They might be required to use an approved client app or a device that's hybrid-joined to Microsoft Entra ID.
In this tutorial, configure the access controls to require multifactor authentication during a sign-in event.
UnderAccess controls, select the current value underGrant, and then selectGrant access.
UnderAccess controls, select the current value underGrant, and then selectGrant access.

Activate the policy
Conditional Access policies can be set toReport-onlyif you want to see how the configuration would affect users, orOffif you don't want to the use policy right now. Because a test group of users is targeted for this tutorial, let's enable the policy, and then test Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.
UnderEnable policy, selectOn.

Test Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication
Let's see your Conditional Access policy and Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication in action.
First, sign in to a resource that doesn't require MFA:
Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode and browse tohttps://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com.Using a private mode for your browser prevents any existing credentials from affecting this sign-in event.

Sign in with your non-administrator test user, such astestuser. Be sure to include@and the domain name for the user account.If this is the first instance of signing in with this account, you're prompted to change the password. However, there's no prompt for you to configure or use multifactor authentication.

Close the browser window.
You configured the Conditional Access policy to require additional authentication for sign in. Because of that configuration, you're prompted to use Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication or to configure a method if you haven't yet done so. Test this new requirement by signing in to the Microsoft Entra admin center:
Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode and sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin center.
