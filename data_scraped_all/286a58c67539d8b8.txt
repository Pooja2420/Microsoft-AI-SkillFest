With Analytics views, you gain a simplified way to specify and share the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data. Analytics provides the reporting platform for Azure DevOps.
Important
Analytics views only support Azure Boards data (work items). Analytics views don't support other data types, such as pipelines. Views provide a flat list of work items and don't support work item hierarchies. At this point, there are no plans to update the connector to support other types of data. For information on other approaches, seeAbout Power BI integration.
