When deploying a machine learning model to a managed online endpoint, you can secure communication with the online endpoint by usingprivate endpoints. In this article, you'll learn how a private endpoint can be used to secure inbound communication to a managed online endpoint. You'll also learn how a workspace managed virtual network can be used to provide secure communication between deployments and resources.
You can secure inbound scoring requests from clients to anonline endpointand secure outbound communications between adeployment, the Azure resources it uses, and private resources. Security for inbound and outbound communication are configured separately. For more information on endpoints and deployments, seeWhat are endpoints and deployments.
The following architecture diagram shows how communications flow through private endpoints to the managed online endpoint. Incoming scoring requests from a client's virtual network flow through the workspace's private endpoint to the managed online endpoint. Outbound communications from deployments to services are handled through private endpoints from the workspace's managed virtual network to those service instances.

Note
This article focuses on network isolation using the workspace's managed virtual network. For a description of the legacy method for network isolation, in which Azure Machine Learning creates a managed virtual network for each deployment in an endpoint, see theAppendix.
Each deployment is isolated from other deployments, regardless of inbound and outbound communication discussed in this article. In other words, even with endpoints/deployments that allow internet inbound/outbound, there's a network isolation between deployments, which blocks any deployment from directly connecting to other deployments.

When you use network isolation to help secure online endpoints, you can use workspace-associated resources from a different resource group than your workspace resource group. However, these resources must belong to the same subscription and tenant as your workspace. Resources that are associated with a workspace include Azure Container Registry, Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, and Application Insights.

Note
This article describes network isolation that applies to data plane operations. These operations result from scoring requests, or model serving. Control plane operations, such as requests to create, update, delete, or retrieve authentication keys, are sent to Azure Resource Manager over the public network.
Secure inbound scoring requests
Secure inbound communication from a client to a managed online endpoint is possible by using aprivate endpoint for the Azure Machine Learning workspace. This private endpoint on the client's virtual network communicates with the workspace of the managed online endpoint and is the means by which the managed online endpoint can receive incoming scoring requests from the client.
To secure scoring requests to the online endpoint, so that a client can access it only through the workspace's private endpoint, set thepublic_network_accessflag for the endpoint todisabled. After you've created the endpoint, you can update this setting to enable public network access if desired.

Secure inbound scoring with public network access from specific IP addresses
Azure Machine Learning workspace supports enabling public network access from specific IP addresses or address ranges. This feature has some interactions with the managed online endpoint'spublic_network_accessflag that you should be aware of when using it with managed online endpoints. For more information, seeScenario: Managed online endpoints with access from specific IP addresses.

Secure outbound access with workspace managed virtual network
To secure outbound communication from a deployment to services, you need to enable managed virtual network isolation for your Azure Machine Learning workspace so that Azure Machine Learning can create a managed virtual network for the workspace.
All managed online endpoints in the workspace (and managed compute resources for the workspace, such as compute clusters and compute instances) automatically use this workspace managed virtual network, and the deployments under the endpoints share the managed virtual network's private endpoints for communication with the workspace's resources.
When you secure your workspace with a managed virtual network, theegress_public_accessflag for managed online deployments no longer applies. Avoid setting this flag when creating the managed online deployment.
egress_public_access
For outbound communication with a workspace managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning:
Creates private endpoints for the managed virtual network to use for communication with Azure resources that are used by the workspace, such as Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry.
Allows deployments to access the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), which can be useful when you want to use curated environments or MLflow no-code deployment.
Allows users to configure private endpoint outbound rules to private resources and configure outbound rules (service tag or FQDN) for public resources. For more information on how to manage outbound rules, seeManage outbound rules.
Furthermore, you can configure two isolation modes for outbound traffic from the workspace managed virtual network, namely:
Allow internet outbound, to allow all internet outbound traffic from the managed virtual network
Allow only approved outbound, to control outbound traffic using private endpoints, FQDN outbound rules, and service tag outbound rules.
For example, say your workspace's managed virtual network contains two deployments under a managed online endpoint, both deployments can use the workspace's private endpoints to communicate with:
The Azure Machine Learning workspace
The Azure Storage blob that is associated with the workspace
The Azure Container Registry for the workspace
The Azure Key Vault
(Optional) additional private resources that support private endpoints.
To learn more about configurations for the workspace managed virtual network, seeManaged virtual network architecture.
Scenarios for network isolation configuration
Your Azure Machine Learning workspace and managed online endpoint each have apublic_network_accessflag that you can use to configure their inbound communication. On the other hand, outbound communication from a deployment depends on the workspace's managed virtual network.
public_network_access
Suppose a managed online endpoint has a deployment that uses an AI model, and you want to use an app to send scoring requests to the endpoint. You can decide what network isolation configuration to use for the managed online endpoint as follows:
For inbound communication:
If the app is publicly available on the internet, then you need toenablepublic_network_accessfor the endpoint so that it can receive inbound scoring requests from the app.
public_network_access
However, say the app is private, such as an internal app within your organization. In this scenario, you want the AI model to be used only within your organization rather than expose it to the internet. Therefore, you need todisablethe endpoint'spublic_network_accessso that it can receive inbound scoring requests only through its workspace's private endpoint.
public_network_access
For outbound communication (deployment):
Suppose your deployment needs to access private Azure resources (such as the Azure Storage blob, ACR, and Azure Key Vault), or it's unacceptable for the deployment to access the internet. In this case, you need toenabletheworkspace's managed virtual networkwith theallow only approved outboundisolation mode. This isolation mode allows outbound communication from the deployment to approved destinations only, thereby protecting against data exfiltration. Furthermore, you can add outbound rules for the workspace, to allow access to more private or public resources. For more information, seeConfigure a managed virtual network to allow only approved outbound.
However, if you want your deployment to access the internet, you can use the workspace's managed virtual network with theallow internet outboundisolation mode. Apart from being able to access the internet, you'll be able to use the private endpoints of the managed virtual network to access private Azure resources that you need.
Finally, if your deployment doesn't need to access private Azure resources and you don't need to control access to the internet, then you don't need to use a workspace managed virtual network.
You can use thepublic_network_accessflag of your Azure Machine Learning workspace to enable or disable inbound workspace access.
Typically, if you secure inbound communication to your workspace (by disabling the workspace'spublic_network_accessflag) you also want to secure inbound communication to your managed online endpoint.
public_network_access
public_network_access
The following chart shows a typical workflow for securing inbound communication to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and your managed online endpoint. For best security, we recommend that you disable thepublic_network_accessflags for the workspace and the managed online endpoint to ensure that both can't be accessed via the public internet. If the workspace doesn't have a private endpoint, you can create one, making sure to include proper DNS resolution. You can then access the managed online endpoint by using the workspace's private endpoint.
public_network_access

Note
Managed online endpoints share the workspace's private endpoint. If you're manually adding DNS records to the private DNS zoneprivatelink.api.azureml.ms, an A record with wildcard*.<per-workspace globally-unique identifier>.inference.<region>.privatelink.api.azureml.msshould be added to route all endpoints under the workspace to the private endpoint.
privatelink.api.azureml.ms
*.<per-workspace globally-unique identifier>.inference.<region>.privatelink.api.azureml.ms
For more information on DNS resolution for your workspace and private endpoint, seeHow to use your workspace with a custom DNS server.
Appendix
Secure outbound access with legacy network isolation method
For managed online endpoints, you can also secure outbound communication between deployments and resources by using an Azure Machine Learning managed virtual network for each deployment in the endpoint. The secure outbound communication is also handled by using private endpoints to those service instances.
Note
We strongly recommend that you use the approach described inSecure outbound access with workspace managed virtual networkinstead of this legacy method.
To restrict communication between a deployment and external resources, including the Azure resources it uses, you should ensure that:
The deployment'segress_public_network_accessflag isdisabled. This flag ensures that the download of the model, code, and images needed by the deployment are secured with a private endpoint. Once you've created the deployment, you can't update (enable or disable) theegress_public_network_accessflag. Attempting to change the flag while updating the deployment fails with an error.

public_network_access
When you have multiple deployments, and you configure theegress_public_network_accesstodisabledfor each deployment in a managed online endpoint, each deployment has its own independent Azure Machine Learning managed virtual network. For each virtual network, Azure Machine Learning creates three private endpoints for communication to the following services:
egress_public_network_access
disabled
The Azure Machine Learning workspace
The Azure Storage blob that is associated with the workspace
The Azure Container Registry for the workspace
For example, if you set theegress_public_network_accessflag todisabledfor two deployments of a managed online endpoint, a total of six private endpoints are created. Each deployment would use three private endpoints to communicate with the workspace, blob, and container registry.

Important
Azure Machine Learning does not support peering between a deployment's managed virtual network and your client's virtual network. For secure access to resources needed by the deployment, we use private endpoints to communicate with the resources.
The following diagram shows incoming scoring requests from a client's virtual network flowing through the workspace's private endpoint to the managed online endpoint. The diagram also shows two online deployments, each in its own Azure Machine Learning managed virtual network. Each deployment's virtual network has three private endpoints for outbound communication with the Azure Machine Learning workspace, the Azure Storage blob associated with the workspace, and the Azure Container Registry for the workspace.

As mentioned earlier, outbound communication from managed online endpoint deployment is to theworkspace API. When the endpoint is configured to usepublic outbound(in other words,public_network_accessflag for the endpoint is set toenabled), then the workspace must be able to accept that public communication (public_network_accessflag for the workspace set toenabled).

When online deployments are created withegress_public_network_accessflag set todisabled, they will have access to the secured resources (workspace, blob, and container registry) only. For instance, if the deployment uses model assets uploaded to other storage accounts, the model download will fail. Ensure model assets are on the storage account associated with the workspace.

Whenegress_public_network_accessis set todisabled, the deployment can only access the workspace-associated resources secured in the virtual network. On the contrary, whenegress_public_network_accessis set toenabled, the deployment can only access the resources with public access, which means it cannot access the resources secured in the virtual network.
