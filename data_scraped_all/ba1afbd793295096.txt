This guide describes the recommendations for using safe deployment practices (SDP). Safe deployment processes and procedures define how to safely make and deploy changes to your workload. Implementing SDP requires you to think about deployments through the lens of managing risk. You can minimize the risk of human error in your deployments and limit the effects of problematic deployments on your users by implementing SDP.
Key design strategies
There are four important guidelines to keep in mind when implementing safe deployment practices:
Safety and consistency: All changes to the production workload are inherently risky and must be made with a focus on safety and consistency.

The following sections provide detailed recommendations on each of these points.
Ensure safety and consistency of deployments
Whether you're deploying an update to your application code, infrastructure as code (IaC), feature flag, or a configuration update, you're introducing risk to the workload. There are nolow-riskdeployments to production. Every deployment must follow a standard pattern and should be automated to enforce consistency and minimize the risk of human error. It's critical that your workload supply chain and deployment pipelines are reliable, secure, and have clearly defined deployment standards. Treat every deployment as a possible risk and subject every deployment to the same level of risk management. Despite the risks, you should continue to deploy regular changes to your workload. Failing to deploy regular updates introduces other risks, like security vulnerabilities that must be addressed through deployments. For more information, seeRecommendations for designing a workload development supply chain.
Frequent small deployments are preferable to infrequent large deployments. Small changes are easier to resolve when issues arise and frequent deployments help your team build confidence in the deployment process. It's also important that you learn from production by reviewing your workload processes when you encounter an anomaly during deployment. You might find weaknesses in the design of your infrastructure or rollout. When issues occur during deployments, ensure thatblamelesspostmortems are part of your SDP process to capture lessons about the incident.
Adopt a progressive exposure model
When deployment issues occur, the goal is to catch them as early as possible to minimize the effect on end users. Implement a gradual rollout deployment model, also known as aprogressive exposure model, to accomplish this goal. Canary deployments are a common example of progressive exposure. In this deployment model, a small group of internal or external users receive the new feature first. After the first group runs the new version without issue, the feature is deployed to successively larger groups until the entire user population is running the new version. Feature flags are typically used to enable the new version for the target users in canary deployments.
Another common deployment model is a blue-green approach. In this model, two identical sets, or pools, of workload infrastructure are deployed. Both pools are able to handle a full production load. The first (blue) pool runs the current version of the deployment where all users land. The second (green) pool is updated with the new feature and internally tested. After internal testing, a subset of the production traffic is routed from the blue pool to the green pool. Like canary deployments, the rollout is progressive as you shift more of the traffic over to the green pool in successively larger rollout waves. After you finish the rollout, the update pool becomes the blue pool and the green pool is ready for the next deployment. The two pools are logically separated from each other to protect from malfunctions. You can deploy a variation of the blue-green model in a workload that uses theDeployment Stampsdesign pattern by deploying on one stamp at a time.
In both of these models, the time between each phase of the rollout should be long enough to enable you to monitor the health metrics of the workload. You should provide amplebake time, time between rollout groups, to help ensure that users from different regions or users who perform different tasks have time to use the workload in their normal capacity. Bake times should be measured in hours and days rather than minutes. Bake times should also increase for each rollout group so that you can account for different time zones and usage patterns over the course of the day.
Develop robust workload health models
Develop a robust health model as part of your observability platform and reliability strategies. Your health model should provide in-depth visibility into the components and overall health of the workload. During a rollout, if you receive an alert about a health change relating to an end user, the rollout should immediately halt and an investigation into the cause of the alert should be performed to help determine the next course of action. If there are no issues reported by end users and all health indicators stay green throughout the bake time, the rollout should continue. Be sure to include usage metrics in your health model to help ensure that a lack of user-reported issues and negative health signals aren't hiding an issue. For more information, seeBuilding a health model.
Implement failure-detection mechanisms
When your deployment causes an issue in one of the rollout groups, the rollout must stop immediately. An investigation into the cause of the issue and the severity of the effects must be performed as soon as the alert is received. Recovery from the issue can include:
Rolling backthe deployment by undoing the changes made in the deployment and reverting back to the last known working configuration.

Rolling forwardthe deployment by addressing the issue in the midst of the rollout. You can address issues mid-rollout by applying a hotfix or otherwise minimizing the issue.

Rolling back changes, especially database, schema, or other stateful component changes, can be complex. Your SDP guidelines should provide clear instructions on how to deal with data changes according to the data estate design for your workload. Similarly, rolling forward must be handled carefully to ensure that SDP isn't neglected and that the hotfix or other minimizing efforts are performed safely.
Establish protocols for emergency deployments
Implement versioning across your build artifacts to help ensure that you can roll back and roll forward when necessary.

Use CI practices to regularly integrate code changes into repositories. CI practices can help you identify integration conflicts and reduce the likelihood of large, risky merges. For more information, see theContinuous integration guide.

Use feature flags to selectively enable or disable new features or changes in production. Feature flags can help you control the exposure of new code and quickly roll back deployment if issues arise.

Emergency SDP protocols
Establish prescriptive protocols that define how your SDP can be adjusted for a hotfix or for emergency issues like a security breach or vulnerability exposure. For example, your emergency SDP protocols might include:
Promotion and approval stage acceleration.

In some cases, the emergency might limit quality and testing gates, but gates should still be run as quickly as possible as an out-of-band exercise. Make sure that you define who can approve SDP acceleration in an emergency and the criteria that must be met for acceleration to be approved. Align your emergency SDP protocols with youremergency response planto help ensure that all emergencies are handled according to the same protocols.
Considerations
Building and maintaining safe deployment practices is complex. Your success in fully implementing robust standards depends on the maturity of your practices across many areas of software development.  Use of automation, IaC-only for infrastructure changes, consistency in branching strategies, use of feature flags, and many other practices can help to ensure safe deployment. Use this guide to optimize your workload and inform your plans for improvement as your practices evolve.
