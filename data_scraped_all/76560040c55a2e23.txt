Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets. You can securely store keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. Azure key vaults may be created and managed through the Azure portal. In this tutorial, you create a key vault, then use it to import a certificate. For more information on Key Vault, review theOverview.
The tutorial shows you how to:
Create a key vault.
Import a certificate in Key Vault using the portal.
Import a certificate in Key Vault using the CLI.
Import a certificate in Key Vault using PowerShell.
Before you begin, readKey Vault basic concepts.

Create a key vault
Create a key vault using one of these three methods:
Create a key vault using the Azure portal
Create a key vault using the Azure CLI
Create a key vault using Azure PowerShell
Import a certificate to your key vault
Note
By default, imported certificates have exportable private keys. You can use the SDK, Azure CLI, or PowerShell to define policies that prevent the private key from being exported.
To import a certificate to the vault, you need to have a PEM or PFX certificate file to be on disk. If the certificate is in PEM format, the PEM file must contain the key as well as x509 certificates. This operation requires the certificates/import permission.
Important
In Azure Key Vault, supported certificate formats are PFX and PEM.
.pem file format contains one or more X509 certificate files.
.pfx file format is an archive file format for storing several cryptographic objects in a single file i.e. server certificate (issued for your domain), a matching private key, and may optionally include an intermediate CA.
In this case, we will create a certificate calledExampleCertificate, or import a certificate calledExampleCertificatewith a path of **/path/to/cert.pem". You can import a certificate with the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
On the page for your key vault, selectCertificates.
Click onGenerate/Import.
On theCreate a certificatescreen choose the following values:Method of Certificate Creation: Import.Certificate Name: ExampleCertificate.Upload Certificate File: select the certificate file from diskPassword: If you are uploading a password protected certificate file, provide that password here. Otherwise, leave it blank. Once the certificate file is successfully imported, key vault will remove that password.
Method of Certificate Creation: Import.
Certificate Name: ExampleCertificate.
Upload Certificate File: select the certificate file from disk
Password: If you are uploading a password protected certificate file, provide that password here. Otherwise, leave it blank. Once the certificate file is successfully imported, key vault will remove that password.
ClickCreate.

When importing a .pem file, check if the format is the following:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----MIID2TCCAsGg...-----END CERTIFICATE----------BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----MIIEvQIBADAN...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
When importing a certificate, Azure Key vault will automatically populate certificate parameters (i.e. validity period, Issuer name, activation date etc.).
Once you receive the message that the certificate has been successfully imported, you may click on it on the list to view its properties.

Import a certificate into your key vault using the Azure CLIaz keyvault certificate importcommand:
az keyvault certificate import --vault-name "<your-key-vault-name>" -n "ExampleCertificate" -f "/path/to/ExampleCertificate.pem"
az keyvault certificate import --vault-name "<your-key-vault-name>" -n "ExampleCertificate" -f "/path/to/ExampleCertificate.pem"
After importing the certificate, you can view the certificate using the Azure CLIaz keyvault certificate showcommand.
az keyvault certificate show --vault-name "<your-key-vault-name>" --name "ExampleCertificate"
az keyvault certificate show --vault-name "<your-key-vault-name>" --name "ExampleCertificate"
You can import a certificate into Key Vault using the Azure PowerShellImport-AzKeyVaultCertificatecmdlet.
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "123" -AsPlainText -Force
Import-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName "<your-key-vault-name>" -Name "ExampleCertificate" -FilePath "C:\path\to\ExampleCertificate.pem" -Password $Password
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "123" -AsPlainText -Force
Import-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName "<your-key-vault-name>" -Name "ExampleCertificate" -FilePath "C:\path\to\ExampleCertificate.pem" -Password $Password
After importing the certificate, you can view the certificate using the Azure PowerShellGet-AzKeyVaultCertificatecmdlet
Get-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName "<your-key-vault-name>" -Name "ExampleCertificate"
Get-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName "<your-key-vault-name>" -Name "ExampleCertificate"
Now, you have created a Key vault, imported a certificate and viewed a certificate's properties.
Clean up resources
Other Key Vault quickstarts and tutorials build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you may wish to leave these resources in place.
When no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the Key Vault and related resources. To delete the resource group through the portal:
Enter the name of your resource group in the Search box at the top of the portal. When you see the resource group used in this quickstart in the search results, select it.
SelectDelete resource group.
In theTYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:box type in the name of the resource group and selectDelete.

In this tutorial, you created a Key Vault and imported a certificate in it. To learn more about Key Vault and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to the articles below.
