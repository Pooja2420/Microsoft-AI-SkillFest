This article explains how to create a failover cluster instance (FCI) by using Azure shared disks with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).
To learn more, see an overview ofFCI with SQL Server on Azure VMsandcluster best practices.
Note
It's now possible to lift and shift your failover cluster instance solution to SQL Server on Azure VMs using Azure Migrate. SeeMigrate failover cluster instanceto learn more.
Prerequisites
Before you complete the instructions in this article, you should already have:
An Azure subscription. Get started with afree Azure account.
Two or more prepared Azure Windows virtual machinesin an availability set, or availability zones.
An account that has permissions to create objects on both Azure virtual machines and in Active Directory.
The latest version ofAzure PowerShell.
Tip
Simplify your deployment and eliminate the need for an Azure Load Balancer or distributed network name (DNN) for your failover cluster instance by creating your SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) inmultiple subnetswithin the same Azure virtual network.
Add Azure shared disk
Deploy a managed disk with the shared disk feature enabled. SetmaxSharestoalign with the number of cluster nodesto make the disk shareable across all FCI nodes.
Premium SSD, Premium SSDv2 and Ultra Disk are supported disk types to use with a SQL Server failover cluster instance.
maxShares
Use zone-redundant storage (ZRS) whenever possible.
Attach shared disk to VMs
Once you've deployed a shared disk with maxShares > 1, you can mount the disk to the VMs that will participate as nodes in the cluster.
To attach the shared disk to your SQL Server VMs, follow these steps:
Select the VM in the Azure portal that you will attach the shared disk to.
SelectDisksin theSettingspane.
SelectAttach existing disksto attach the shared disk to the VM.
Choose the shared disk from theDisk namedrop-down.
SelectSave.
Repeat these steps for every cluster node SQL Server VM.
After a few moments, the shared data disk is attached to the VM and appears in the list of Data disks for that VM.
Initialize shared disk
Once the shared disk is attached on all the VMs, you can initialize the disks of the VMs that will participate as nodes in the cluster. Initialize the disks onallof the VMs.
To initialize the disks for your SQL Server VM, follow these steps:
Connect to one of the VMs.
From inside the VM, open theStartmenu and typediskmgmt.mscin the search box to open theDisk Managementconsole.
Disk Management recognizes that you have a new, uninitialized disk and theInitialize Diskwindow appears.
Verify the new disk is selected and then selectOKto initialize it.
The new disk appears asunallocated. Right-click anywhere on the disk and selectNew simple volume. TheNew Simple Volume Wizardwindow opens.
Proceed through the wizard, keeping all of the defaults, and when you're done selectFinish.
CloseDisk Management.
A pop-up window appears notifying you that you need to format the new disk before you can use it. SelectFormat disk.
In theFormat new diskwindow, check the settings, and then selectStart.
A warning appears notifying you that formatting the disks erases all of the data. SelectOK.
When the formatting is complete, selectOK.
Repeat these steps on each SQL Server VM that will participate in the FCI.
Create Windows Failover Cluster
The steps to create your Windows Server Failover Cluster differ between single subnet and multi-subnet environments. To create your cluster, follow the steps in the tutorial for either amulti-subnet scenarioor asingle subnet scenario. Though these tutorials create an availability group, the steps to create the cluster are the same for a failover cluster instance.
Configure quorum
Since the disk witness is the most resilient quorum option, and the FCI solution uses Azure shared disks, it's recommended to configure a disk witness as the quorum solution.
If you have an even number of votes in the cluster, configure thequorum solutionthat best suits your business needs. For more information, seeQuorum with SQL Server VMs.
Validate cluster
Validate the cluster on one of the virtual machines by using the Failover Cluster Manager UI or PowerShell.
To validate the cluster using the UI, follow these steps:
InServer Manager, selectTools, and then selectFailover Cluster Manager.
Right-click the cluster inFailover Cluster Manager, selectValidate Clusterto open theValidate a Configuration Wizard.
On theValidate a Configuration Wizard, selectNext.
On theSelect Servers or a Clusterpage, enter the names of both virtual machines.
On theTesting optionspage, selectRun only tests I select.
SelectNext.
On theTest Selectionpage, select all testsexceptStorage.
SelectNext.
On theConfirmationpage, selectNext.  TheValidate a Configurationwizard runs the validation tests.
To validate the cluster by using PowerShell, run the following script from an administrator PowerShell session on one of the virtual machines:
Test-Cluster âNode ("<node1>","<node2>") âInclude "Inventory", "Network", "System Configuration"
Test-Cluster âNode ("<node1>","<node2>") âInclude "Inventory", "Network", "System Configuration"
Test cluster failover
Test the failover of your cluster. InFailover Cluster Manager, right-click your cluster, selectMore Actions>Move Core Cluster Resource>Select node, and then select the other node of the cluster. Move the core cluster resource to every node of the cluster, and then move it back to the primary node. Ensure you can successfully move the cluster to each node before installing SQL Server.

Add shared disks to cluster
Use the Failover Cluster Manager to add the attached Azure shared disks to the cluster.
To add disks to your cluster, follow these steps:
In theServer Managerdashboard, selectTools, and then selectFailover Cluster Manager.
In theServer Managerdashboard, selectTools, and then selectFailover Cluster Manager.
Select the cluster and expand it in the navigation pane.
Select the cluster and expand it in the navigation pane.
SelectStorageand then selectDisks.
SelectStorageand then selectDisks.
Right-clickDisksand selectAdd Disk:
Right-clickDisksand selectAdd Disk:

Choose the Azure shared disk in theAdd Disks to a Clusterwindow.  SelectOK.
Choose the Azure shared disk in theAdd Disks to a Clusterwindow.  SelectOK.

After the shared disk is added to the cluster, you will see it in the Failover Cluster Manager.

Create SQL Server FCI
After you've configured the failover cluster and all cluster components, including storage, you can create the SQL Server FCI.
Create first node in the SQL FCI
To create the first node in the SQL Server FCI, follow these steps:
Connect to the first virtual machine by usingBastion.
Connect to the first virtual machine by usingBastion.
InFailover Cluster Manager, make sure that all core cluster resources are on the first virtual machine. If necessary, move the disks to that virtual machine.

Azure Marketplace gallery images come with SQL Server Management Studio installed. If you didn't use a marketplace imageDownload SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Register with SQL IaaS Agent extension
To manage your SQL Server VM from the portal, register it with theSQL IaaS Agent extension.
Note
At this time, SQL Server failover cluster instances on Azure virtual machines registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension only support alimitednumber of features available through basic registration, and not those that require the agent, such as automated backup, patching, Microsoft Entra authentication and advanced portal management. See thetable of benefitsto learn more.
Register a SQL Server VM with PowerShell (-LicenseType can bePAYGorAHUB):
PAYG
AHUB
# Get the existing compute VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>

# Register SQL VM with SQL IaaS Agent extension
New-AzSqlVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
   -LicenseType <license_type>
# Get the existing compute VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>

# Register SQL VM with SQL IaaS Agent extension
New-AzSqlVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
   -LicenseType <license_type>
Configure connectivity
If you deployed your SQL Server VMs in multiple subnets, skip this step. If you deployed your SQL Server VMs to a single subnet, then you'll need to configure an additional component to route traffic to your FCI. You can configure a virtual network name (VNN) with an Azure Load Balancer, or a distributed network name for a failover cluster instance.Review the differences between the twoand then deploy either adistributed network nameor avirtual network name and Azure Load Balancerfor your failover cluster instance.
Limitations
MSDTC is not supported on Windows Server 2016 and earlier.
Limited extension support
At this time, SQL Server failover cluster instances on Azure virtual machines registered with theSQL IaaS Agent extensiononly support a limited number of features available through basic registration, and not those that require the agent, such as automated backup, patching, Microsoft Entra authentication and advanced portal management. See thetable of benefitsto learn more.
If your SQL Server VM has already been registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension and you've enabled any features that require the agent, you need todelete the extensionfrom the SQL Server VM by deleting theSQL virtual machineresource for the corresponding VMs, and then registering it with the SQL IaaS Agent extension again. When you're deleting theSQL virtual machineresource by using the Azure portal, clear the check box next to the correct virtual machine to avoid deleting the virtual machine.
Next steps
If Azure shared disks are not the appropriate FCI storage solution for you, consider creating your FCI usingpremium file sharesorStorage Spaces Directinstead.
