This guide describes the recommendations for designing a highly available multi-region cloud environment. High availability is a foundational tenet of designing for reliability. A highly available architecture can help you avoid downtime as much as possible and recover efficiently if downtime does occur.
Active-activeandactive-passiveare general architecture types that can be applied in different ways, depending on the platform you deploy your environment on. This guide focuses on a multi-region cloud environment design. On Azure, you can also design an active-active or active-passive architecture within a single region by usingavailability zones. For detailed guidance on designing a highly available architecture by using availability zones, see theAzure Well-Architected Framework guide.
Key design strategies
Active-active and active-passive are the two fundamental approaches to designing a highly available cloud environment. Active-active environments are designed to handle production loads in every region in which you deploy your workload. Active-passive environments are designed to handle production loads only in the primary region but fail over to the secondary (passive) region when necessary. Selecting the best Azure regions for your workload is a key part of designing a highly available multi-region environment. For guidance on selecting Azure regions, see theSelect Azure Regions guide.
This section describes design options that you should consider when you evaluate each pattern and refine your architecture to meet your business requirements.
SeeDeployment Stamps patternfor guidance on architecting your workload in a repeatable, scalable way. This design pattern can help you optimize your high-availability design for efficient management.
The following sections describe the design options of the two patterns.
Deploy in active-active for zero downtime
Active-active at capacity: Mirrored deployment stamps in two or more Azure regions, each configured to handle production workloads for the region or regions they serve and scalable to handle loads from other regions in case of a regional outage.Networking: Uselatencyorweightedglobal routing to spread traffic among regions.Data replication and consistency: Use a globally distributed data store likeAzure Cosmos DBfor multi-region read and write capabilities. For relational databases, usereadable replicaswith read-only connection strings.Advantage of this design: Lower operating costs than an overprovisioned design.Disadvantage of this design: Possible degradation of the user experience when scaling up to meet the demands of a full load if another region experiences an outage.

Deploy in active-passive for disaster recovery
Warm spare: One primary region and one or more secondary regions. The secondary region is deployed with the minimum possible compute and data sizing and runs without load. This region is known as awarm spareregion. Upon failover, the compute and data resources are scaled to handle the load from the primary region.Networking: Usepriorityglobal routing.Data replication and consistency: Replicate your database to your passive region and use the automatic failover capabilities of platform as a service (PaaS) solutions likeAzure Cosmos DBandAzure SQL Database.Advantage of this design: Shortest recovery time among the active-passive designs.Disadvantage of this design: Highest operating cost among the active-passive designs.

Note
Regardless of your high-availability design, remember to configure redundancy for supporting services like Azure DevOps infrastructure, jump boxes, monitoring, and any other critical service that's necessary to administer the workload.
