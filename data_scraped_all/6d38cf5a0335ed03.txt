This article describes how to create Kubernetes clusters in Azure Local using the Azure portal. The workflow is as follows:
How to create a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure portal. By default, the cluster is Azure Arc-connected.
While creating the cluster, you provide a Microsoft Entra group that contains the list of Microsoft Entra users with Kubernetes cluster administrator access.
Before you begin
Before you begin, make sure you have the following details from your on-premises infrastructure administrator:Azure subscription ID: the Azure subscription ID where Azure Resource Bridge, AKS Arc extensions, and custom location is created.Custom Location ID: the Azure Resource Manager ID of the custom location. Your infrastructure admin should give you "Contributor" access to the custom location. Custom Location is a required parameter to create Kubernetes clusters.AKS Arc logical network ID: the Azure Resource Manager ID of the Azure Arc logical network. Your infrastructure admin should give you "Contributor" access to an AKS Arc logical network. The logical network ID is a required parameter to create Kubernetes clusters.
Azure subscription ID: the Azure subscription ID where Azure Resource Bridge, AKS Arc extensions, and custom location is created.
Custom Location ID: the Azure Resource Manager ID of the custom location. Your infrastructure admin should give you "Contributor" access to the custom location. Custom Location is a required parameter to create Kubernetes clusters.
AKS Arc logical network ID: the Azure Resource Manager ID of the Azure Arc logical network. Your infrastructure admin should give you "Contributor" access to an AKS Arc logical network. The logical network ID is a required parameter to create Kubernetes clusters.
In order to connect to the cluster from anywhere, you must create a Microsoft Entra group and add members to it. All the members in the Microsoft Entra group have cluster administrator access to the AKS Arc cluster. Make sure to add yourself to the Microsoft Entra group. If you don't add yourself, you can't access the AKS Arc cluster using kubectl. For more information about creating Microsoft Entra groups and adding users, seecreate Microsoft Entra groups using Azure portal.

On the Basics page, configure the following options:Project details:Select an Azure subscription. This Azure subscription is where your infrastructure administrator deployed the Arc Resource Bridge, AKS Arc extension and custom location.Select an Azure Resource group, such asmyResourceGroup.Cluster details:Enter a Kubernetes cluster name, such asmyk8scluster. The name of a Kubernetes cluster name must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters.Select a custom location where you want to deploy the cluster. Make sure your infrastructure administrator gave you "Contributor" access on a custom location.Select a K8s version from the list of available versions.Primary node pool:You can leave the default values selected, or change the default value from the drop down list.SSH KeysSSH keys are essential for troubleshooting and log collection. Be sure to save your private key file for future use.You can use an existing SSH key or generate a new key pair during cluster creation. For information about how to create new SSH keys from the Azure portal, seeCreate and store SSH keys in the portal.ToUse an existing public key by providing the SSH public key value, provide an RSA public key in the single line format (starting with "ssh-rsa") or the multi-line PEM format.

For simplicity and reliability, we run these important Kubernetes components in separate control plane nodes.Leave the default values selected.Node pools:You can choose to add optional node pools in addition to the primary node pool you created on the Basics page.

SelectReview + create. When you navigate to theReview + createtab, Azure runs validation on the settings that you chose. If validation passes, you can create the cluster by selectingCreate. If validation fails, it then indicates which settings you must modify.

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster. When your deployment is complete, navigate to your resource by either selectingGo to resource, or browse to the Kubernetes cluster resource group and select the resource.
