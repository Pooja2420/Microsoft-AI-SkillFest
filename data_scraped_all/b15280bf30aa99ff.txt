Warning
If you are using theconfigurable token lifetimefeature currently in public preview, please note that we donât support creating two different policies for the same user or app combination: one with this feature and another one with configurable token lifetime feature. Microsoft retired the configurable token lifetime feature for refresh and session token lifetimes on January 30, 2021 and replaced it with the Conditional Access authentication session management feature.
Before enabling Sign-in Frequency, make sure other reauthentication settings are disabled in your tenant. If "Remember MFA on trusted devices" is enabled, be sure to disable it before using Sign-in frequency, as using these two settings together may lead to prompting users unexpectedly. To learn more about reauthentication prompts and session lifetime, see the article,Optimize reauthentication prompts and understand session lifetime for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.
Policy deployment
To make sure that your policy works as expected, the recommended best practice is to test it before rolling it out into production. Ideally, use a test tenant to verify whether your new policy works as intended. For more information, see the articlePlan a Conditional Access deployment.

Validation
Use theWhat If toolto simulate a sign-in from the user to the target application and other conditions based on how you configured your policy. The authentication session management controls show up in the result of the tool.
Prompt tolerance
We factor for five minutes of clock skew whenevery timeis selected in policy, so that we donât prompt users more often than once every five minutes. If the user completed MFA in the last 5 minutes, and they hit another Conditional Access policy that requires reauthentication, we don't prompt the user. Over-prompting users for reauthentication can impact their productivity and increase the risk of users approving MFA requests they didnât initiate. Use "Sign-in frequency â every time" only for specific business needs.
Known issues
If you configure sign-in frequency for mobile devices: Authentication after each sign-in frequency interval could be slow, it can take 30 seconds on average. Also, it could happen across various apps at the same time.
On iOS devices: If an app configures certificates as the first authentication factor and the app has both Sign-in frequency andIntune mobile application management policiesapplied, end-users are blocked from signing in to the app when the policy triggers.
Microsoft Entra Private Access does not yet support setting sign-in frequency to every time.
