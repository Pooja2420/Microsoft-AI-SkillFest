Auditing forAzure SQL DatabaseandAzure Synapse Analyticssupports writing database events to anAzure Storage accountbehind a virtual network and firewall.
This article explains two ways to configure Azure SQL Database and Azure storage account for this option. The first uses the Azure portal, the second uses REST.
Background
Azure Virtual Network (VNet)is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network in your own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.
To learn more about the VNet concepts, Best practices and many more, seeWhat is Azure Virtual Network.
To learn more about how to create a virtual network, seeQuickstart: Create a virtual network using the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
For audit to write to a storage account behind a VNet or firewall, the following prerequisites are required:
A general-purpose v2 storage account. If you have a general-purpose v1 or blob storage account,upgrade to a general-purpose v2 storage account. For more information, seeTypes of storage accounts.
The premium storage with BlockBlobStorage is supported
The storage account must be on the same tenant and at the same location as thelogical SQL server(it's OK to be on different subscriptions).
The Azure Storage account requiresAllow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account. Set this on the Storage AccountFirewalls and Virtual networks.
Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account
You must haveMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermission on the selected storage account. For more information, seeAzure built-in roles.
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Note
When Auditing to storage account is already enabled on a server / db, and if the target storage account is moved behind a firewall, we lose write access to
the storage account and audit logs stop getting written to it.To make auditing work we have to resave the audit settings from portal.
Configure in Azure portal
Connect toAzure portalwith your subscription. Navigate to the resource group and server.
Click onAuditingunder the Security heading. SelectOn.
Click onAuditingunder the Security heading. SelectOn.
SelectStorage. Select the storage account where logs will be saved. The storage account must comply with the requirements listed inPrerequisites.

Note
If the selected Storage account is behind VNet, you will see the following message:
You have selected a storage account that is behind a firewall or in a virtual network. Using this storage requires to enable 'Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account' on the storage account and creates a server managed identity with 'storage blob data contributor' RBAC.
You have selected a storage account that is behind a firewall or in a virtual network. Using this storage requires to enable 'Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account' on the storage account and creates a server managed identity with 'storage blob data contributor' RBAC.
If you do not see this message, then storage account is not behind a VNet.
Select the number of days for the retention period. Then clickOK. Logs older than the retention period are deleted.

You have successfully configured audit to write to a storage account behind a VNet or firewall.
Configure with REST commands
As an alternative to using the Azure portal, you can use REST commands to configure audit to write database events on a storage account behind a VNet and Firewall.
The sample scripts in this section require you to update the script before you run them. Replace the following values in the scripts:
<subscriptionId>
<resource group>
<logical SQL Server>
<administrator login>
<complex password>
To configure SQL Audit to write events to a storage account behind a VNet or Firewall:
Register your server with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). Use either PowerShell or REST API.PowerShellConnect-AzAccount
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId <subscriptionId>
Set-AzSqlServer -ResourceGroupName <your resource group> -ServerName <azure server name> -AssignIdentityREST API:Sample requestPUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/<azure server name>?api-version=2015-05-01-previewRequest body{
"identity": {
           "type": "SystemAssigned",
           },
"properties": {
  "fullyQualifiedDomainName": "<azure server name>.database.windows.net",
  "administratorLogin": "<administrator login>",
  "administratorLoginPassword": "<complex password>",
  "version": "12.0",
  "state": "Ready"
  }
}
Register your server with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). Use either PowerShell or REST API.
PowerShell
Connect-AzAccount
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId <subscriptionId>
Set-AzSqlServer -ResourceGroupName <your resource group> -ServerName <azure server name> -AssignIdentity

Set-AzSqlServer -ResourceGroupName <your resource group> -ServerName <azure server name> -AssignIdentity
REST API:
Sample request
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/<azure server name>?api-version=2015-05-01-preview
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/<azure server name>?api-version=2015-05-01-preview
Request body

           "type": "SystemAssigned",
           },
"properties": {
  "fullyQualifiedDomainName": "<azure server name>.database.windows.net",
  "administratorLogin": "<administrator login>",
  "administratorLoginPassword": "<complex password>",
  "version": "12.0",
  "state": "Ready"
  }
}
{
"identity": {
           "type": "SystemAssigned",

  "administratorLogin": "<administrator login>",
  "administratorLoginPassword": "<complex password>",
  "version": "12.0",
  "state": "Ready"
  }
}
Assign the Storage Blob Data Contributor role to the server hosting the database that you registered with Microsoft Entra ID in the previous step.For detailed steps, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.NoteOnly members with Owner privilege can perform this step. For various Azure built-in roles, refer toAzure built-in roles.

Configure theserver's blob auditing policy, without specifying astorageAccountAccessKey:Sample requestPUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/<azure server name>/auditingSettings/default?api-version=2017-03-01-previewRequest body{
  "properties": {
   "state": "Enabled",
   "storageEndpoint": "https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net"
  }
}

Using Azure PowerShell
Create or Update Database Auditing Policy (Set-AzSqlDatabaseAudit)
Create or Update Server Auditing Policy (Set-AzSqlServerAudit)
Using Azure Resource Manager template
You can configure auditing to write database events on a storage account behind virtual network and firewall usingAzure Resource Managertemplate, as shown in the following example:
Important
In order to use storage account behind virtual network and firewall, you need to setisStorageBehindVnetparameter to true
Deploy an Azure SQL Server with Auditing enabled to write audit logs to a blob storage

The linked sample is on an external public repository and is provided 'as is', without warranty, and are not supported under any Microsoft support program/service.
Next steps
Use PowerShell to create a virtual network service endpoint, and then a virtual network rule for Azure SQL Database.
