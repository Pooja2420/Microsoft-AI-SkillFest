In this tutorial, you'll create the resources you need to start working with Azure Machine Learning.
Aworkspace. To use Azure Machine Learning, you'll first need a workspace. The workspace is the central place to view and manage all the artifacts and resources you create.
Acompute instance. A compute instance is a pre-configured cloud-computing resource that you can use to train, automate, manage, and track machine learning models. A compute instance is the quickest way to start using the Azure Machine Learning SDKs and CLIs. You'll use it to run Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in the rest of the tutorials.
In this tutorial, you'll create your resources inAzure Machine Learning studio.
Other ways to create a workspace are via theAzure portal or SDK,the CLI,Azure PowerShell,  orthe Visual Studio Code extension.
For other ways to create a compute instance, seeCreate a compute instance.
This video shows you how to create a workspace and compute instance in Azure Machine Learning studio. The steps are also described in the sections below.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Create the workspace
The workspace is the top-level resource for your machine learning activities, providing a centralized place to view and manage the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning.
If you  already have a workspace, skip this section and continue toCreate a compute instance.
If you don't yet have a workspace, create one now:
Sign in toAzure Machine Learning studio
Sign in toAzure Machine Learning studio
SelectCreate workspace
SelectCreate workspace
Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:FieldDescriptionWorkspace nameEnter a unique name that identifies your workspace. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others. The workspace name is case-insensitive.Friendly nameThis name is not restricted by Azure naming rules. You can use spaces and special characters in this name.HubA hub allows you to group related workspaces together and share resources. If you have access to a hub, select it here.  If you don't have access to a hub, leave this blank.
Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:
If you did not select a hub, provide the advanced information.  If you selected a hub, these values are taken from the hub.FieldDescriptionSubscriptionSelect the Azure subscription that you want to use.Resource groupUse an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. You needcontributororownerrole to use an existing resource group. For more information about access, seeManage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace.RegionSelect the Azure region closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.
If you did not select a hub, provide the advanced information.  If you selected a hub, these values are taken from the hub.

Note
This creates a workspace along with all required resources. If you would like to more customization, use theAzure portalinstead.  SeeCreate a workspacefor more information.
Create a compute instance
You'll use thecompute instanceto run Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in the rest of the tutorials. If you don't yet have a compute instance, create one now:
Select your workspace.

Quick tour of the studio
The studio is your web portal for Azure Machine Learning. This portal combines no-code and code-first experiences for an inclusive data science platform.
Review the parts of the studio on the left-hand navigation bar:
TheAuthoringsection of the studio contains multiple ways to get started in creating machine learning models. You can:Notebookssection allows you to create Jupyter Notebooks, copy sample notebooks, and run notebooks and Python scripts.Automated MLsteps you through creating a machine learning model without writing code.Designergives you a drag-and-drop way to build models using prebuilt components.

TheAssetssection of the studio helps you keep track of the assets you create as you run your jobs. If you have a new workspace, there's nothing in any of these sections yet.

TheManagesection of the studio lets you create and manage compute and external services you link to your workspace. It's also where you can create and manage aData labelingproject.

Learn from sample notebooks
Use the sample notebooks available in studio to help you learn about how to train and deploy models. They're referenced in many of the other articles and tutorials.
On the left navigation, selectNotebooks.
At the top, selectSamples.

Use notebooks in theSDK v2folder for examples that show the current version of the SDK, v2.
These notebooks are read-only, and are updated periodically.
When you open a notebook, select theClone this notebookbutton at the top to add your copy of the notebook and any associated files into your own files. A new folder with the notebook is created for you in theFilessection.
Create a new notebook
When you clone a notebook fromSamples, a copy is added to your files and you can start running or modifying it. Many of the tutorials mirror these sample notebooks.
But you could also create a new, empty notebook, then copy/paste code from a tutorial into the notebook. To do so:
Still in theNotebookssection, selectFilesto go back to your files,
Still in theNotebookssection, selectFilesto go back to your files,
Select+to add files.
Select+to add files.
SelectCreate new file.
SelectCreate new file.

Clean up resources
If you plan to continue now to other tutorials, skip toNext step.
Stop compute instance
If you're not going to use it now, stop the compute instance:
In the studio, on the left menu, selectCompute.
In the top tabs, selectCompute instances
Select the compute instance in the list.
On the top toolbar, selectStop.
Delete all resources
Important
The resources that you created can be used as prerequisites to other Azure Machine Learning tutorials and how-to articles.
If you don't plan to use any of the resources that you created, delete them so you don't incur any charges:
In the Azure portal, in the search box, enterResource groupsand select it from the results.
In the Azure portal, in the search box, enterResource groupsand select it from the results.
From the list, select the resource group that you created.
From the list, select the resource group that you created.
In theOverviewpage, selectDelete resource group.
In theOverviewpage, selectDelete resource group.

Enter the resource group name. Then selectDelete.
Enter the resource group name. Then selectDelete.
Next step
You now have an Azure Machine Learning workspace, which contains a compute instance to use for your development environment.
Continue on to learn how to use the compute instance to run notebooks and scripts in the Azure Machine Learning cloud.
