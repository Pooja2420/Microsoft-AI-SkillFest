In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, theDefender for Open-Source Relational Databasesplan within Defender for Databases detects anomalous activities that indicate unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. With this plan, you can address potential threats to databases without the need to be a security expert or manage advanced security-monitoring systems.

Benefits
Defender for Cloud provides multicloud alerts on anomalous activities so that you can detect potential threats and respond to them as they occur.
When you enable this plan, Defender for Cloud provides alerts when it detects anomalous database access and query patterns, along with suspicious database activities. The alerts include:
Details of the suspicious activity that triggered them.
The associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic.
Recommended actions for how to investigate and mitigate the threat.
Options for continuing your investigations by using Microsoft Sentinel.

Alert types
Activities that trigger multicloud alerts enriched with threat intelligence include:
Anomalous database access and query patterns: For example, an abnormally high number of failed sign-in attempts with different credentials (a brute force attack). The alerts can separate successful brute force attacks from unsuccessful ones.
Suspicious database activity: For example, a legitimate user accessing a SQL server from a breached computer that communicated with a crypto-mining command and control (C&C) server.
View the full list of multicloud alerts for database servers inAlerts for open-source relational databases.
