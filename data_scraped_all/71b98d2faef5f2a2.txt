SQL Server databases are critical workloads that require a low recovery-point objective (RPO) and long-term retention. You can back up SQL Server databases running on Azure virtual machines (VMs) by usingAzure Backup.
This article shows how to back up a SQL Server database that's running on an Azure VM to an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault.
Note
See theSQL backup support matrixto know more about the supported configurations and scenarios.
Prerequisites
Before you back up a SQL Server database, check the following criteria:
Identify or create aRecovery Services vaultin the same region and subscription as the VM hosting the SQL Server instance.

Check that you don't have any other backup solutions enabled for the database. Disable all other SQL Server backups before you back up the database.
Check that you don't have any other backup solutions enabled for the database. Disable all other SQL Server backups before you back up the database.
When using SQL Server 2008 R2 or SQL Server 2012, you might run into the time zone issue for backup as describedhere. Make sure that you are on the latest cumulative updates to avoid the time zone-related issue described above. If applying the updates to the SQL Server instance on the Azure VM isn't feasible, disable Daylight Saving Time (DST) for the time zone on the virtual machine.

Note
You can enable Azure Backup for an Azure VM and also for a SQL Server database running on the VM without conflict.
Establish network connectivity
For all operations, a SQL Server VM requires connectivity to the Azure Backup service, Azure Storage, and Microsoft Entra ID. This can be achieved by using private endpoints or by allowing access to the required public IP addresses or FQDNs. Not allowing proper connectivity to the required Azure services may lead to failure in operations like database discovery, configuring backup, performing backups, and restoring data.
The following table lists the various alternatives you can use for establishing connectivity:
The following sections provide more details around using these options.
Note
You can use theAzure Backup connectivity test scriptsto self-diagnose the network connectivity issues on Windows environment.
Private endpoints allow you to connect securely from servers inside a virtual network to your Recovery Services vault. The private endpoint uses an IP from the VNET address space for your vault. The network traffic between your resources inside the virtual network and the vault travels over your virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network. This eliminates exposure from the public internet. Read more on private endpoints for Azure Backuphere.
If you use Network Security Groups (NSG), use theAzureBackupservice tag to allow outbound access to Azure Backup. In addition to the Azure Backup tag, you also need to allow connectivity for authentication and data transfer by creating similarNSG rulesfor Microsoft Entra ID (AzureActiveDirectory) and Azure Storage(Storage).  The following steps describe the process to create a rule for the Azure Backup tag:
InAll Services, go toNetwork security groupsand select the network security group.
InAll Services, go toNetwork security groupsand select the network security group.

SelectAddto save the newly created outbound security rule.
SelectAddto save the newly created outbound security rule.
You can similarly create NSG outbound security rules for Azure Storage and Microsoft Entra ID.
If you're using Azure Firewall, create an application rule by using theAzureBackupAzure Firewall FQDN tag. This allows all outbound access to Azure Backup.
Note
Azure Backup currently doesn't support theTLS inspection enabledApplication Ruleon Azure Firewall.
If you choose to allow access service IPs, refer to the IP ranges in the JSON file availablehere. You'll need to allow access to IPs corresponding to Azure Backup, Azure Storage, and Microsoft Entra ID.
You can also use the following FQDNs to allow access to the required services from your servers:
*.backup.windowsazure.com
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.queue.core.windows.net
*.blob.storage.azure.net
*.login.microsoft.com
When using an internal load balancer, you need to allow the outbound connectivity from virtual machines behind the internal load balancer to perform backups. To do so, you can use a combination of internal and external standard load balancers to create an outbound connectivity.Learn moreabout the configuration to create anegress onlysetup for VMs in the backend pool of the internal load balancer.
When you back up a SQL Server database on an Azure VM, the backup extension on the VM uses the HTTPS APIs to send management commands to Azure Backup and data to Azure Storage. The backup extension also uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. Route the backup extension traffic for these three services through the HTTP proxy. Use the list of IPs and FQDNs mentioned above for allowing access to the required services. Authenticated proxy servers aren't supported.
Note
Disable proxy for localhost communications within the VM. Proxy will be honored for outbound communications from the SQL VM.

Create a backup policy
A backup policy defines when backups are taken and how long they're retained.
A policy is created at the vault level.
Multiple vaults can use the same backup policy, but you must apply the backup policy to each vault.
When you create a backup policy, a daily full backup is the default.
You can add a differential backup, but only if you configure full backups to occur weekly.

Note
Each log backup is chained to the previous full backup to form a recovery chain. This full backup will be retained until the retention of the last log backup has expired. This might mean that the full backup is retained for an extra period to make sure all the logs can be recovered. Let's assume you have a weekly full backup, daily differential, and 2 hour logs. All of them are retained for 30 days. But, the weekly full can be really cleaned up/deleted only after the next full backup is available, that is, after 30 + 7 days. For example, a weekly full backup happens on Nov 16th. According to the retention policy, it should be retained until Dec 16th. The last log backup for this full happens before the next scheduled full, on Nov 22. Until this log is available until Dec 22, the Nov 16th full can't be deleted. So, the Nov 16th full is retained until Dec 22.
Enable auto-protection
You can enable auto-protection to automatically back up all existing and future databases to a standalone SQL Server instance or to an Always On availability group.
There's no limit on the number of databases you can select for auto-protection at a time. Discovery typically runs every eight hours. The auto-protection of a newly discovered database will be triggered within 32 hours. However, you can discover and protect new databases immediately if you manually run a discovery by selecting theRediscover DBsoption.
If the auto-protection operation on the newly discovered database fails, it'll be retried three times. If all three retries fail, the database won't be protected.
You can't selectively protect or exclude databases from protection in an instance at the time you enable auto-protection.
If your instance already includes some protected databases, they'll remain protected under their respective policies even after you turn on auto-protection. All unprotected databases added later will have only a single policy that you define at the time of enabling auto-protection, listed underConfigure Backup. However, you can change the policy associated with an auto-protected database later.
If theConfigure Protectionoperation for the newly discovered database fails, it won't raise an alert. However, a failed backup job could be found on theBackup jobspage.
To enable auto-protection:
InItems to backup, select the instance for which you want to enable auto-protection.
InItems to backup, select the instance for which you want to enable auto-protection.
Select the drop-down list underAUTOPROTECT, chooseON, and then selectOK.

If you need to disable auto-protection, select the instance name underConfigure Backup, and then selectDisable Autoprotectfor the instance. All databases will continue to be backed up, but future databases won't be automatically protected.
