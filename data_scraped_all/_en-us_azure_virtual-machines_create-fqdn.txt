When you create a virtual machine (VM) in theAzure portal, a public IP resource for the virtual machine is automatically created. You use this public IP address to remotely access the VM. Although the portal doesn't create afully qualified domain name, or FQDN, you can add one once the VM is created. This article demonstrates the steps to create a DNS name or FQDN. If you create a VM without a public IP address, you can't create an FQDN.
Create an FQDN

UnderDNS name label, enter the prefix you want to use.
SelectSaveat the top of the page.
SelectOverviewin the left menu to return to the VM overview blade.
