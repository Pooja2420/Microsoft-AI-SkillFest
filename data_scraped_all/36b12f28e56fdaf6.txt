This article shows how to use the Azure portal to create anAzure Batch accountthat has account properties to fit your compute scenario. You see how to view account properties like access keys and account URLs. You also learn how to configure and create user subscription mode Batch accounts.
For background information about Batch accounts and scenarios, seeBatch service workflow and resources.
Create a Batch account
When you create a Batch account, you can choose betweenuser subscriptionandBatch servicepool allocation modes. For most cases, you should use the default Batch service pool allocation mode. In Batch service mode, compute and virtual machine (VM)-related resources for pools are allocated on Batch service managed Azure subscriptions.
In user subscription pool allocation mode, compute and VM-related resources for pools are created directly in the Batch account subscription when a pool is created. In scenarios where youcreate a Batch pool in a virtual networkthat you specify, certain networking related resources are created in the subscription of the virtual network.
To create a Batch account in user subscription pool allocation mode, you must also register your subscription with Azure Batch, and associate the account with Azure Key Vault. For more information about requirements for user subscription pool allocation mode, seeConfigure user subscription mode.
To create a Batch account in the default Batch service mode:

Configure user subscription mode
You must take several steps before you can create a Batch account in user subscription mode.
Important
To create a Batch account in user subscription mode, you must haveContributororOwnerrole in the subscription.
Accept legal terms
You must accept the legal terms for the image before you use a subscription with a Batch account in user subscription mode. If you haven't done this action, you might get the errorAllocation failed due to marketplace purchase eligibilitywhen you try to allocate Batch nodes.
To accept the legal terms, run the commandsGet-AzMarketplaceTermsandSet-AzMarketplaceTermsin PowerShell. Set the following parameters based on your Batch pool's configuration:
Publisher: The image's publisher
Publisher
Product: The image offer
Product
Name: The offer SKU
Name
For example:
Get-AzMarketplaceTerms -Publisher 'microsoft-azure-batch' -Product 'ubuntu-server-container' -Name '20-04-lts' | Set-AzMarketplaceTerms -Accept
Get-AzMarketplaceTerms -Publisher 'microsoft-azure-batch' -Product 'ubuntu-server-container' -Name '20-04-lts' | Set-AzMarketplaceTerms -Accept
Important
If you've enabled Private Azure Marketplace, you must follow the steps inAdd new collectionto add a new collection to allow the selected image.

Allow Batch to access the subscription
When you create the first user subscription mode Batch account in an Azure subscription, you must register your subscription with Batch resource provider, and assignAzure Batch Service Orchestration Roleto Microsoft Azure Batch service principal. You need to do this configuration only once per subscription.
Important
You needOwnerpermissions in the subscription to take this action.
In theAzure portal, search for and selectsubscriptions.

Create a key vault
User subscription mode requiresAzure Key Vault. The key vault must be in the same subscription and region as the Batch account.
To create a new key vault:
Search for and selectkey vaultsfrom the Azure Search box, and then selectCreateon theKey vaultspage.
On theCreate a key vaultpage, enter a name for the key vault, and choose an existing resource group or create a new one in the same region as your Batch account.
On theAccess configurationtab, select eitherAzure role-based access controlorVault access policyunderPermission model, and underResource access, check all 3 checkboxes forAzure Virtual Machine for deployment,Azure Resource Manager for template deploymentandAzure Disk Encryption for volume encryption.
Leave the remaining settings at default values, selectReview + create, and then selectCreate.

Tip
For enhanced security, it is advised to confine the authentication mode of the Batch account solely toMicrosoft Entra ID. This measure mitigates the risk of shared key exposure and introduces additional RBAC controls. For more details, seeBatch security best practices.
Warning
TheTask Authentication Tokenwill retire on September 30, 2024. Should you require this feature, it is recommended to useUser assigned managed identityin the Batch pool as an alternative.
Grant access to the key vault manually
To grant access to the key vault manually inAzure portal, you need to assignKey Vault Secrets Officerrole for Batch:
