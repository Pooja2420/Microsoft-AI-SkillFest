Easily restore deleted test plans and test suites with new self-service APIs. We are introducing GET and PATCH APIs that allow you to look up deleted test plans or suites and restore them along with their child itemsâall without needing customer support. With these APIs, you can quickly recover accidentally deleted test work items, reducing downtime and improving productivity. While run artifacts wonât be restored, all related test plans, suites, and test cases can be brought back to your workspace with ease. This self-service feature gives you greater control over test management and streamlines the restoration process, making it faster and more efficient to recover critical test assets.
