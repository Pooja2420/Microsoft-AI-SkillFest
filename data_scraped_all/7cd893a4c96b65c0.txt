Automatically update the state of a work item according to the state of its child tasks. For example, if one task is changed toDoing, then the parent gets set toDoing. And if all tasks are inClosedstate, then the parent getsClosed.
Doing
Doing
Closed
Closed
Rules are established at the team backlog level and are applicable to all work items at that specific level. You have the flexibility to establish these rules independently for each backlog level, including stories, features, and epics. For example, you can automate the closure of user stories, but keep features and epics open.
Important
Work item automation rules exclusively pertain to your teamâs workflow on the backlog and boards. Other teams within your project can customize their own rules to align with their specific work processes.
Prerequisites
Set rules
Do the following steps to set team rules for each backlog level.
Note
Work items must belong to the same team; when you close a task in a different team or project, it doesn't trigger the closure of the parent item.
