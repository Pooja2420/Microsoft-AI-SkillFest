Work item links are associations between two work items or a work item and another object. Links describe the relationship between objects. You can use work item links to track dependencies and related work for traceability, share information, manage complex projects that involve multiple teams or products, track code changes, tests, and more.
Prerequisites
Types of links
The following types of links help you manage the various relationships between work items and other objects.
For more information about work link types, including parent/child, related, and predecessor-successor, seeWork link types.

Link work items to deployments
As you develop your software, you can capture which code changes and builds support the completion of a work item. Your team can understand what work was done or how a bug was fixed through the audit trail of changes to the code base.
The link types used to construct these links are:Branch,Build,Changeset,Commit,Found in build,Integrated in build,Pull Request,Versioned Item, andIntegrated in release environment. These types appear in the following image.

Tip
Drive development from the work item when you create it. You can also add the work item ID when creating branches, commits, and pull requests. Git lets you link work items to commits using theCommitlink type. Here are the ways to do it:
Before committing your changes, add work item IDs inGit Changesfor Visual Studio 2022 orTeam Explorerfor previous versions of Visual Studio:
Before committing your changes, add work item IDs inGit Changesfor Visual Studio 2022 orTeam Explorerfor previous versions of Visual Studio:

Use thegit-commitcommand and include the work item ID in your comment. For example, apply this comment#35 Catch null exceptionto your commit. When you push the commit, the system creates a Commit link between the commit and work item #35.

As shown in the following image, the Deployment control displays release information for two release stages. It includes work items linked to a Git commit or pull request for a release pipeline configured to integrate with Azure Boards.

Deployment control
The Deployment control provides several features to help you manage and track the release status of work items. The following list outlines these features:
Default appearance:The Deployment control appears on the work item forms for User Story (Agile), Product Backlog Item (Scrum), Issue (Basic), Requirement (CMMI), Feature, Epic, Bug, Task, and Test Case work item types by default.

Link work items to TFVC code development
Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) allows you to link work items to version control changesets or versioned source code files using theChangesetandVersioned Itemlink types. When you check in pending changes or use My Work to check in changes, work items are automatically linked to your changes. For more information, seeCheck in your work.


Link work items to tests
Test-related link types link test case management work items to one another or to other work items. From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, you can view which test cases are defined for a test suite and which test suites are defined for a test plan. These objects aren't linked to each other through link types.
You can link work items to test cases using theTested/Tested Bylink types. Use the same link controls you use to link work items to other work items. SeeLink work items.
The following image shows the full set of link types that you can use with test management work item types. Most links between test management objects occur by running a task from theTestpages or Microsoft Test Manager.

For example, when you add Shared Steps to a Test Case, they automatically get linked using theTest Case/Shared Stepslink types. For more information, seeShare steps between test cases.


From theTestsection, you can add test plans, test suites, and test cases, which are automatically linked. You can't add these items through a specific link type. The test system creates and manages the associations of test results to test cases and test plans.

Link work items to a Web site, network share, storyboard, or document
You can use a hyperlink or storyboard link type to link a work item to a website, network share, or document on a network share. Both link types are one-way links. To add these link types, use the same controls described earlier. SeeLink work items.
When using the storyboard link type, specify a storyboard or document that provides work item specifications. This link type allows your team to access the shared file and add their comments.

View dependencies and track related work
Azure DevOps provides several ways to view dependencies and track related work:
Query Editor: You can use the Query Editor to create custom queries that show all work items linked to a specific work item.
Backlogs and Boards: The Backlogs and Boards views show parent-child relationships between work items, allowing you to see dependencies at a glance.
Dependency Tracker: The Dependency Tracker is a Power BI report that provides a visual representation of dependencies between work items.
To view the list of all objects linked to a work item, do the following steps:
Open the work item and selectLinks. The links tab indicates the count of all linked objects. Linked objects get grouped under their link type, with a count within each group.
Open the work item and selectLinks. The links tab indicates the count of all linked objects. Linked objects get grouped under their link type, with a count within each group.

(Optional) Expand or collapse each group, and sort within each group byState,Latest Update, orCommentby choosing the corresponding column title.For example, the followingLinkstab shows a portion of the 64 linked objects for a work item.Links prefaced with theexclamation mark indicate that the build, release, or other object is deleted. Due to retention policies, these objects automatically get deleted after a certain time period.

Links prefaced with theexclamation mark indicate that the build, release, or other object is deleted. Due to retention policies, these objects automatically get deleted after a certain time period.
Query for linked work items
To filter items based on hierarchical links, use theTree of work itemsquery type. To filter items based on all link types, useWork items and direct links.
To find work items linked to other work items with specific link types, use a query that shows a primary and a secondary set of work items:
The primary set meets the field criteria.
The secondary set is linked to the primary set.
You canât query for work items in releases, but you can query for work items with external links. Add more query filters to refine your search.
For more information, seeQuery work items by link or attachment count.
You can't construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases. These items aren't linked together using Parent/Child or any other link type. You can only view the hierarchy through theTest>Test Planspage. For more information, seeCreate test plans and test suites.

Use Azure CLI to add, remove, or show links
You can add, remove, and show details of links to a work item with theaz boards work-item relationcommand. For more information, seeGet started with Azure DevOps CLI.
Link types include work link types, remote link types, hyperlinks, and attached files. For a list of all link types that you can specify, run theaz boards work-item relation list-typecommand.
az boards work-item relation add
az boards work-item relation remove
az boards work-item relation show
az boards work-item relation add
az boards work-item relation remove
az boards work-item relation show
In the following examples, the organization isfabrikamand the project ID corresponds toaaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb. The table format is used to show the output. For other formats, seeOutput formats for Azure CLI commands.
Link work items
To link one or more work items to a single work item, enter theaz boards work-item relation addcommand.
Required parameters include the ID of the work item to link to and the link type. Supported link types includeParent,Child,Related, andRemote Related. For a list of all link types, run theaz boards work-item relation list-typecommand.
For work items defined within the same organization, you must specify the work item ID or target URL. For work items defined in a remote organization, specify the target URL. You can specify multiple values by separating IDs or URLs with a comma.
az boards work-item relation add --id
                                 --relation-type
                                 [--detect {false, true}]
                                 [--org]
