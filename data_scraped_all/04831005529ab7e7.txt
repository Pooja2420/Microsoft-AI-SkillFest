Use AI enrichment with image and text processing
Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
This article describes how to use image processing, natural language processing, and custom skills to capture domain-specific data. You can use that data to enrich text and image documents. Incorporate Azure AI Search with AI enrichment to help identify and explore relevant content at scale. This solution uses AI enrichment to extract meaning from the original complex, unstructured JFK Assassination Records (JFK Files) dataset.

Dataflow
The following dataflow corresponds to the preceding diagram. The dataflow describes how the unstructured JFK Files dataset passes through the AI Search skills pipeline to produce structured and indexable data.
Unstructured data in Azure Blob Storage, such as documents and images, is ingested into AI Search.

Built-in skillsbased on the Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Language APIs provide AI enrichments such as image optical character recognition (OCR), image analysis, text translation, entity recognition, and full-text search.

After the enrichment process is complete, the indexer saves the enriched and indexed documents in asearch index. Full-text search and other query forms can use this index.

The enriched documents can also project into aknowledge store, which downstream apps like knowledge mining apps or data science apps can use.

Queries access the enriched content in the search index. The index supports custom analyzers, fuzzy search queries, filters, and a scoring profile to tune search relevance.

Components
This solution uses the following Azure components.
AI Searchindexes the content and powers the user experience in this solution. You can use AI Search to applyprebuilt AI skillsto content. And you can use the extensibility mechanism to addcustom skills, which provide specific enrichment transformations.
Visionusestext recognitionto extract and recognize text information from images. TheRead APIuses the latest OCR recognition models and is optimized for large, text-heavy documents and noisy images.
Thelegacy OCR APIisn't optimized for large documents but supports more languages. The accuracy of OCR results can vary based on the quality of the scan and the image. This solution uses OCR to produce data in thehOCR format.
Languageusestext analyticscapabilities likenamed entity recognitionandkey phrase extractionto extract text information from unstructured documents.
Blob Storageis REST-based object storage for data that you can access from anywhere in the world through HTTPS. You can use Blob Storage to expose data publicly to the world or to store application data privately. Blob Storage is ideal for large amounts of unstructured data like text or graphics.
Table Storagestores highly available, scalable, structured, and semi-structured NoSQL data in the cloud.
Functionsis a serverless compute service that you can use to run small pieces of event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. This solution uses a Functions method to apply the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) cryptonyms list to the JFK Files as a custom skill.
This solution builds a standalone web app inAzure App Serviceto test, demonstrate, and search the index and to explore connections in the enriched and indexed documents.
Scenario details
Large, unstructured datasets can include typewritten and handwritten notes, photos, diagrams, and other unstructured data that standard search solutions can't parse. TheJFK Filescontain over 34,000 pages of documents about the CIA investigation of the 1963 JFK assassination.
You can use AI enrichment in AI Search to extract and enhance searchable, indexable text from images, blobs, and other unstructured data sources like the JFK Files. AI enrichment uses pretrained machine learning skill sets from the Azure AI servicesVisionandLanguageAPIs. You can also create and attachcustom skillsto add special processing for domain-specific data like CIA cryptonyms. AI Search can then index and search that context.
The AI Search skills in this solution can be categorized into the following groups:
Image processing: This solution uses built-intext extractionandimage analysisskills, including object and face detection, tag and caption generation, and celebrity and landmark identification. These skills create text representations of image content, which you can search by using the query capabilities of AI Search.Document crackingis the process of extracting or creating text content from nontext sources.

Potential use cases
The JFK Filessample projectandonline demopresents a particular AI Search use case. This solution idea isn't intended to be a framework or scalable architecture for all scenarios. Instead, this solution idea provides a general guideline and example. The code project and demo create a public website and publicly readable storage container for extracted images, so you shouldn't use this solution with nonpublic data.
You can also use this architecture to:
Increase the value and utility of unstructured text and image content in search apps and data science apps.
