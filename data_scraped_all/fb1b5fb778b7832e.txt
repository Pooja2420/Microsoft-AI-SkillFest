Azure NetApp Filesis an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file storage service. The service supports the most demanding enterprise file-workloads in the cloud: databases, SAP, and high-performance computing applications, with no code changes. For more information on Azure NetApp Files, seeAzure NetApp Filesdocumentation.
Azure VMware Solutionsupports attaching Network File System (NFS) datastores as a persistent storage option. You can create NFS datastores with Azure NetApp Files volumes and attach them to clusters of your choice. You can also create virtual machines (VMs) on different Azure NetApp Files datastores for optimal cost and performance.
By using NFS datastores backed by Azure NetApp Files, you can expand your storage instead of scaling the clusters. You can also use Azure NetApp Files volumes to replicate data from on-premises or primary VMware vSphere environments for the secondary site.
Create your Azure VMware Solution and create Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes in the virtual network connected to it using an ExpressRoute. Ensure there's connectivity from the private cloud to the NFS volumes created. Use those volumes to create NFS datastores and attach the datastores to clusters of your choice in a private cloud. As a native integration, you need no other permissions configured via vSphere.
The following diagram demonstrates a typical architecture of Azure NetApp Files backed NFS datastores attached to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud via ExpressRoute.

Note
NFS traffic from the ESXi hosts does not traverse any NSX components. Traffic traverses the ESXi VMkernel port directly to the NFS mount via the Azure network.
Prerequisites
Before you begin the prerequisites, review thePerformance best practicessection to learn about optimal performance of NFS datastores on Azure NetApp Files volumes.
Deploy Azure VMware Solutionprivate cloud and a dedicated virtual network connected via ExpressRoute gateway. The virtual network gateway should be configured with the Ultra performance or ErGw3Az SKU and have FastPath enabled. For more information, seeConfigure networking for your VMware private cloudandNetwork planning checklist.
Create anNFSv3 volume for Azure NetApp Filesin the same virtual network created in the previous step.Verify connectivity from the private cloud to Azure NetApp Files volume by pinging the attached target IP.Based on your performance requirements, select the correct service level needed for the Azure NetApp Files capacity pool. Select optionAzure VMware Solution Datastorelisted under theProtocolsection.Create a volume withStandardnetwork featuresif available for ExpressRoute FastPath connectivity.Under theProtocolsection, selectAzure VMware Solution Datastoreto indicate the volume is created to use as a datastore for Azure VMware Solution private cloud.If you're usingexport policiesto control access to Azure NetApp Files volumes, enable the Azure VMware private cloud IP range, not individual host IPs. Faulty hosts in a private cloud could get replaced. If the IP isn't enabled, connectivity to datastore is impacted.

Considerations for Azure NetApp Files storage with cool access
When choosing to useAzure NetApp Files storage with cool accesson datastores for AVS, consider the performance characteristics of your workloads. Cool access is best suited for applications and workloads that primarily involve sequential I/O operations or tolerate varying read latency. Workloads with high random I/O and latency sensitivity should avoid using cool access due to an increase in latency when reading data from the cool tier.
Also consider adjusting cool access settings for the workload to fit the expected access patterns. For more information, seePerformance considerations for Azure NetApp Files storage with cool access.
Use cases where cool access is a good fit:
Virtual machine templates and ISO files
VMDKs with home directories (if not using Azure NetApp Files directly for this purpose)
VMDKs with content repositories
VMDKs with application data
VMDKs with archive and application-level backup data
Use cases to not use cool access:
VMDKs containing production database files with high random I/O and latency sensitivity
VMDKs with operating system boot disks

Protect Azure NetApp Files datastores and VMs
Cloud Backup for Virtual Machines is a plug-in for Azure VMware Solution that provides backup and restore capabilities for datastores and VMs residing on Azure NetApp Files datastores. With Cloud Backup for Virtual Machines, you can take VM-consistent snapshots for quick recovery points and easily restore VMs and VMDKs residing on Azure NetApp Files datastores. For more information, seeInstall Cloud Backup for Virtual Machines.
Service level change for Azure NetApp Files datastore
Based on performance requirements of the datastore, you can change the service level of the Azure NetApp Files volume used for the datastore. Use the instructions provided todynamically change the service level of a volume for Azure NetApp Files.
Changing the service level has no effect on the datastore or private cloud. There's no downtime and the volume IP address/mount path remains unchanged. However, the volume resource ID changes as a result of the capacity pool change. To correct any metadata mismatch, rerun the datastore creation in Azure CLI for the existing datastore with the new Resource ID for the Azure NetApp Files volume:
az vmware datastore netapp-volume create \
    --name <name of existing datastore> \
    --resource-group <resource group containing AVS private cloud> \
    --cluster <cluster name in AVS private cloud> \
    --private-cloud <name of AVS private cloud> \
    --net-app-volume /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/<NetApp account>/capacityPools/<changed capacity pool>/volumes/<volume name>
az vmware datastore netapp-volume create \
    --name <name of existing datastore> \
    --resource-group <resource group containing AVS private cloud> \
    --cluster <cluster name in AVS private cloud> \
    --private-cloud <name of AVS private cloud> \
    --net-app-volume /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<resource group>/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/<NetApp account>/capacityPools/<changed capacity pool>/volumes/<volume name>
Important
The parameters for datastorename,resource-group,cluster, andprivate-cloudmust beexactly the same as those on the existing datastore in the private cloud. Thevolume-idis the updated Resource ID of the Azure NetApp Files volume after the service level change.
