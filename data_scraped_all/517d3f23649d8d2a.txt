In this tutorial, you learn how to:
view Azure DDoS Protection diagnostic logs including notifications, mitigation reports and mitigation flow logs.
DDoS Protection diagnostic logs provide you with the ability to view DDoS Protection notifications, mitigation reports and mitigation flow logs after a DDoS attack. You can view these logs in your Log Analytics workspace.
Attack mitigation reports use the Netflow protocol data, which is aggregated to provide detailed information about the attack on your resource. Anytime a public IP resource is under attack, the report generation starts as soon as the mitigation starts. There will be an incremental report generated every 5 mins and a post-mitigation report for the whole mitigation period. This is to ensure that in an event the DDoS attack continues for a longer duration of time, you'll be able to view the most current snapshot of mitigation report every 5 minutes and a complete summary once the attack mitigation is over.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
DDoS Network Protectionmust be enabled on a virtual network orDDoS IP Protectionmust be enabled on a public IP address.
Configure DDoS Protection diagnostic logs. To learn more, seeConfigure diagnostic logs.
Simulate an attack using one of our simulation partners. To learn more, seeTest with simulation partners.

Example log queries
DDoS Protection Notifications
Notifications will notify you anytime a public IP resource is under attack, and when attack mitigation is over.

DDoS Mitigation FlowLogs
Attack mitigation flow logs allow you to review the dropped traffic, forwarded traffic, and other interesting data-points during an active DDoS attack in near-real time. You can ingest the constant stream of this data into Microsoft Sentinel or to your third-party SIEM systems via event hub for near-real time monitoring, take potential actions and address the need of your defense operations.
