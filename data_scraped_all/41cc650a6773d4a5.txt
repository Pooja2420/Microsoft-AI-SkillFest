Azure Private Linkallows you to securely link Azure PaaS services to your virtual network using private endpoints. For many services, you just set up an endpoint per resource. This means you can connect your on-premises or multicloud servers with Azure Arc and send all traffic over an AzureExpressRouteor site-to-siteVPN connectioninstead of using public networks.
Starting with Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can use a Private Link Scope model to allow multiple servers or machines to communicate with their Azure Arc resources using a single private endpoint.
This article covers when to use and how to set up an Azure Arc Private Link Scope.
Advantages
With Private Link you can:
Connect privately to Azure Arc without opening up any public network access.
Ensure data from the Azure Arc-enabled machine or server is only accessed through authorized private networks. This also includes data fromVM extensionsinstalled on the machine or server that provide post-deployment management and monitoring support.
Prevent data exfiltration from your private networks by defining specific Azure Arc-enabled servers and other Azure services resources, such as Azure Monitor, that connects through your private endpoint.
Securely connect your private on-premises network to Azure Arc using ExpressRoute and Private Link.
Keep all traffic inside the Microsoft Azure backbone network.
For more information, seeKey benefits of Azure Private Link.
How it works
Azure Arc Private Link Scope connects private endpoints (and the virtual networks they're contained in) to an Azure resource, in this case Azure Arc-enabled servers. When you enable any one of the Azure Arc-enabled servers supported VM extensions, such as Azure Monitor, those resources connect other Azure resources. Such as:
Log Analytics workspace, required for Azure Automation Change Tracking and Inventory, Azure Monitor VM insights, and Azure Monitor log collection with Azure Monitor agent.
Azure Automation account, required for Update Management and Change Tracking and Inventory.
Azure Key Vault
Azure Blob storage, required for Custom Script Extension.

Connectivity to any other Azure resource from an Azure Arc-enabled server requires configuring Private Link for each service, which is optional, but recommended. Azure Private Link requires separate configuration per service.
For more information about configuring Private Link for the Azure services listed earlier, see theAzure Automation,Azure Monitor,Azure Key Vault, orAzure Blob storagearticles.
Important
Azure Private Link is now generally available. Both Private Endpoint and Private Link service (service behind standard load balancer) are generally available. Different Azure PaaS onboard to Azure Private Link following different schedules. SeePrivate Link availabilityfor an updated status of Azure PaaS on Private Link. For known limitations, seePrivate EndpointandPrivate Link Service.
The Private Endpoint on your VNet allows it to reach Azure Arc-enabled servers endpoints through private IPs from your network's pool, instead of using to the public IPs of these endpoints. That allows you to keep using your Azure Arc-enabled servers resource without opening your VNet to outbound traffic not requested.

Traffic from the Private Endpoint to your resources will go over the Microsoft Azure backbone, and not routed to public networks.

You can configure each of your components to allow or deny ingestion and queries from public networks. That provides a resource-level protection, so that you can control traffic to specific resources.

Restrictions and limitations
The Azure Arc-enabled servers Private Link Scope object has a number of limits you should consider when planning your Private Link setup.
You can associate at most one Azure Arc Private Link Scope with a virtual network.
An Azure Arc-enabled machine or server resource can only connect to one Azure Arc-enabled servers Private Link Scope.
All on-premises machines need to use the same private endpoint by resolving the correct private endpoint information (FQDN record name and private IP address) using the same DNS forwarder. For more information, seeAzure Private Endpoint DNS configuration
The Azure Arc-enabled server and Azure Arc Private Link Scope must be in the same Azure region. The Private Endpoint and the virtual network must also be in the same Azure region, but this region can be different from that of your Azure Arc Private Link Scope and Arc-enabled server.
Network traffic to Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Resource Manager does not traverse the Azure Arc Private Link Scope and will continue to use your default network route to the internet. You can optionallyconfigure a resource management private linkto send Azure Resource Manager traffic to a private endpoint.
Other Azure services that you will use, for example Azure Monitor, requires their own private endpoints in your virtual network.
Remote access to the server using Windows Admin Center or SSH is not supported over private link at this time.
Planning your Private Link setup
To connect your server to Azure Arc over a private link, you need to configure your network to accomplish the following:
Establish a connection between your on-premises network and an Azure virtual network using asite-to-site VPNorExpressRoute circuit.

This article assumes you have already set up your ExpressRoute circuit or site-to-site VPN connection.
Network configuration
Azure Arc-enabled servers integrate with several Azure services to bring cloud management and governance to your hybrid machines or servers. Most of these services already offer private endpoints, but you need to configure your firewall and routing rules to allow access to Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Resource Manager over the internet until these services offer private endpoints.
There are two ways you can achieve this:
If your network is configured to route all internet-bound traffic through the Azure VPN or ExpressRoute circuit, you can configure the network security group (NSG) associated with your subnet in Azure to allow outbound TCP 443 (HTTPS) access to Microsoft Entra ID and Azure usingservice tags. The NSG rules should look like the following:SettingMicrosoft Entra ID ruleAzure ruleSourceVirtual networkVirtual networkSource port ranges**DestinationService TagService TagDestination service tagAzureActiveDirectoryAzureResourceManagerDestination port ranges443443ProtocolTCPTCPActionAllowAllowPriority150 (must be lower than any rules that block internet access)151 (must be lower than any rules that block internet access)NameAllowAADOutboundAccessAllowAzOutboundAccess
If your network is configured to route all internet-bound traffic through the Azure VPN or ExpressRoute circuit, you can configure the network security group (NSG) associated with your subnet in Azure to allow outbound TCP 443 (HTTPS) access to Microsoft Entra ID and Azure usingservice tags. The NSG rules should look like the following:

Configure on-premises DNS forwarding
Your on-premises machines or servers need to be able to resolve the private link DNS records to the private endpoint IP addresses. How you configure this depends on whether you're using Azure private DNS zones to maintain DNS records, or if you're using your own DNS server on-premises and how many servers you're configuring.
DNS configuration using Azure-integrated private DNS zones
If you set up private DNS zones for Azure Arc-enabled servers and Guest Configuration when creating the private endpoint, your on-premises machines or servers need to be able to forward DNS queries to the built-in Azure DNS servers to resolve the private endpoint addresses correctly. You need a DNS forwarder in Azure (either a purpose-built VM or an Azure Firewall instance with DNS proxy enabled), after which you can configure your on-premises DNS server to forward queries to Azure to resolve private endpoint IP addresses.
For more information, seeAzure Private Resolver with on-premises DNS forwarder.
Manual DNS server configuration
If you opted out of using Azure private DNS zones during private endpoint creation, you will need to create the required DNS records in your on-premises DNS server.
In the Azure portal, navigate to the private endpoint resource associated with your virtual network and private link scope.

From the service menu, underSettings, selectDNS configurationto see a list of the DNS records and corresponding IP addresses that you need to set up on your DNS server. The FQDNs and IP addresses will change based on the region you selected for your private endpoint and the available IP addresses in your subnet.

The FQDNs and IP addresses will change based on the region you selected for your private endpoint and the available IP addresses in your subnet.
Follow the guidance from your DNS server vendor to add the necessary DNS zones and A records to match the table in the portal. Ensure that you select a DNS server that is appropriately scoped for your network. Every machine or server that uses this DNS server now resolves the private endpoint IP addresses and must be associated with the Azure Arc Private Link Scope, or the connection will be refused.

Single server scenarios
If you're only planning to use Private Links to support a few machines or servers, you might not want to update your entire network's DNS configuration. In this case, you can add the private endpoint hostnames and IP addresses to your operating systemsHostsfile. Depending on the OS configuration, the Hosts file can be the primary or alternative method for resolving hostname to IP address.

Tip
Network traffic from the Azure Connected Machine agentto Microsoft Entra ID (login.windows.net,login.microsoftonline.com,pas.windows.net) and Azure Resource Manager (management.azure.com) will continue to use public endpoints. If your server needs to communicate through a proxy server to reach these endpoints,configure the agent with the proxy server URLbefore connecting it to Azure. You might also need toconfigure a proxy bypassfor the Azure Arc services if your private endpoint is not accessible from your proxy server.
login.windows.net
login.microsoftonline.com
pas.windows.net
management.azure.com
Configure an existing Azure Arc-enabled server
For Azure Arc-enabled servers that were set up prior to your private link scope, you can allow them to start using the Azure Arc-enabled servers Private Link Scope by completing the following steps.
In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Arc Private Link Scope resource.
In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Arc Private Link Scope resource.
From the service menu, underConfigure, selectAzure Arc resourcesand then+ Add.
From the service menu, underConfigure, selectAzure Arc resourcesand then+ Add.
Select the servers in the list that you want to associate with the Private Link Scope, and then selectSelectto save your changes.
Select the servers in the list that you want to associate with the Private Link Scope, and then selectSelectto save your changes.

It might take up to 15 minutes for the Private Link Scope to accept connections from the recently associated server(s).
Troubleshooting
If you run into problems, the following suggestions may help:
Check your on-premises DNS server to verify that it's either forwarding to Azure DNS or is configured with appropriate A records in your private link zone. These lookup commands should return private IP addresses in your Azure virtual network. If they resolve public IP addresses, double check your machine or server and network's DNS configuration.nslookup gbl.his.arc.azure.com
nslookup agentserviceapi.guestconfiguration.azure.com
