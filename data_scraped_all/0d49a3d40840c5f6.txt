In this article
Azure NetApp Files is an Azure-native, enterprise-class service that you can use to run file workloads in the cloud and store files. Use this fully managed, cloud-based service to:
Choose service and performance levels.
Manage data protection.
Create Azure NetApp Files accounts.
Create capacity pools.
Create volumes.
Create and manage file shares that have high performance, low latency, high availability, and scalability.
Use the familiar protocols and tools that you use for on-premises enterprise applications. Azure NetApp Files supports Server Message Block (SMB), Network File System (NFS), and dual-protocol volumes. You can use Azure NetApp Files for file sharing, high-performance computing, home directories, and databases.

Technology scope
This review focuses on the interrelated decisions for the following Azure resource:
Azure NetApp Files
Reliability
The purpose of the Reliability pillar is to provide continued functionality bybuilding enough resilience and the ability to recover fast from failures.
Reliability design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy applied for individual components, system flows, and the system as a whole.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Reliability. Determine its relevance to your business requirements while keeping in mind the scalability and performance of your workloads. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.
Design your workload to align with business objectives and avoid unnecessary complexity or overhead.Use a practiced and balanced approach to make decisions that reflect the needs of your workload. Your Azure NetApp Files deployment choices can affect other components. For example, the subnet size for your Azure NetApp Files deployment determines the number of available IP addresses. And your network features setting determines the available networks and features.

And your network features setting determines the available networks and features.
Identify user flows and system flows.Understand customer needs and business requirements so that you can effectively plan for reliability and optimize security. To limit access to and from necessary networks, use the principle of least privilege when you assign permissions. To authorize access to Azure NetApp Files data, use features or services such as network security groups (NSGs), Microsoft Entra ID hybrid identities, Microsoft Entra Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). To restrict default access to Azure NetApp Files volumes, use features such as file locking.

Define reliability targets and recovery targets.Visualize recovery targets and drive actions to achieve reliability goals and recoverability goals for your workload. To improve reliability and recovery, define these targets and develop an understanding of Azure NetApp Files solutions. Targets help optimize snapshots, high availability between availability zones, cross-zone and cross-region replication, and SMB continuous availability for supported applications.

Build redundancy.Deploy your workload across availability zones and regions to build redundancy in the workload and supporting infrastructure. This approach ensures that you can quickly recover from failures. Active-passive deployments can handle production loads only in the primary region, but the deployment fails over to the secondary passive region when necessary.

Security
The purpose of the Security pillar is to provideconfidentiality, integrity, and availabilityguarantees to the workload.
TheSecurity design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those goals by applying approaches to the technical design of your file storage configuration.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Security. Identify vulnerabilities and controls to improve the security posture. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.
Isolate, filter, and control network traffic across both ingress and egress flows.Control network traffic to mitigate potential security events. You can filter traffic between Azure resources with an NSG. Or use user-defined routes on the Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet to limit traffic.

Develop a security strategy.Azure NetApp Files supports NFS, SMB, and dual-protocol volumes. If you use dual-protocol volumes, understand the security needs of those volumes and determine which security style suits your workload's needs. If you need a Windows Server Active Directory connection for SMB, NFSv4.1 Kerberos, or LDAP lookups, you should align that security baseline to compliance requirements, industry standards, and platform recommendations. Azure NetApp Files uses standard CryptoMod to generate AES-256 encryption keys, which you can apply to your SMB server. To develop an appropriate security strategy, enable LDAP over TLS, encrypt SMB connections to the domain controller, assign administrator privileged users for SMB volumes, and ensure that you have a backup policy and security protocols.
