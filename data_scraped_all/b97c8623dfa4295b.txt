Autoscale settings help ensure that you have the right amount of resources running to handle the fluctuating load of your application. You can configure autoscale settings to be triggered based on metrics that indicate load or performance, or triggered at a scheduled date and time.
This article explains the autoscale settings.
Autoscale setting schema
The following example shows an autoscale setting with these attributes:
A single default profile.
Two metric rules in this profile: one for scale-out, and one for scale-in.The scale-out rule is triggered when the virtual machine scale set's average percentage CPU metric is greater than 85% for the past 10 minutes.The scale-in rule is triggered when the virtual machine scale set's average is less than 60% for the past minute.
The scale-out rule is triggered when the virtual machine scale set's average percentage CPU metric is greater than 85% for the past 10 minutes.
The scale-in rule is triggered when the virtual machine scale set's average is less than 60% for the past minute.
Note
A setting can have multiple profiles. To learn more, see theprofilessection. A profile can also have multiple scale-out rules and scale-in rules defined. To see how they're evaluated, see theevaluationsection.

Autoscale profiles
Define up to 20 different profiles per autoscale setting.There are three types of autoscale profiles:
Default profile: Use the default profile if you don't need to scale your resource based on a particular date and time or day of the week. The default profile runs when there are no other applicable profiles for the current date and time. You can only have one default profile.
Default profile: Use the default profile if you don't need to scale your resource based on a particular date and time or day of the week. The default profile runs when there are no other applicable profiles for the current date and time. You can only have one default profile.
Fixed-date profile: The fixed-date profile is relevant for a single date and time. Use the fixed-date profile to set scaling rules for a specific event. The profile runs only once, on the event's date and time. For all other times, autoscale uses the default profile....

Recurrence profile: A recurrence profile is used for a day or set of days of the week. The schema for a recurring profile doesn't include an end date. The end of date and time for a recurring profile is set by the start time of the following profile. When the portal is used to configure recurring profiles, the default profile is automatically updated to start at the end time that you specify for the recurring profile. For more information on configuring multiple profiles, seeAutoscale with multiple profilesThe partial schema example here shows a recurring profile. It starts at 06:00 and ends at 19:00 on Saturdays and Sundays. The default profile has been modified to start at 19:00 on Saturdays and Sundays.{

Autoscale evaluation
Autoscale settings can have multiple profiles. Each profile can have multiple rules. Each time the autoscale job runs, it begins by choosing the applicable profile for that time. Autoscale then evaluates the minimum and maximum values, any metric rules in the profile, and decides if a scale action is necessary. The autoscale job runs every 30 to 60 seconds, depending on the resource type. After a scale action occurs, the autoscale job waits for the cooldown period before it scales again. The cooldown period applies to both scale-out and scale-in actions.
Which profile will autoscale use?
Each time the autoscale service runs, the profiles are evaluated in the following order:
Fixed-date profiles
Recurring profiles
Default profile
The first suitable profile that's found is used.
How does autoscale evaluate multiple rules?
After autoscale determines which profile to run, it evaluates the scale-out rules in the profile, that is, wheredirection = "Increase". If one or more scale-out rules are triggered, autoscale calculates the new capacity determined by thescaleActionspecified for each of the rules. If more than one scale-out rule is triggered, autoscale scales to the highest specified capacity to ensure service availability.
For example, assume that there are two rules: Rule 1 specifies a scale-out by three instances, and rule 2 specifies a scale-out by five. If both rules are triggered, autoscale scales out by five instances. Similarly, if one rule specifies scale-out by three instances and another rule specifies scale-out by 15%, the higher of the two instance counts is used.
If no scale-out rules are triggered, autoscale evaluates the scale-in rules, that is, rules withdirection = "Decrease". Autoscale only scales in if all the scale-in rules are triggered.
Autoscale calculates the new capacity determined by thescaleActionof each of those rules. To ensure service availability, autoscale scales in by as little as possible to achieve the maximum capacity specified. For example, assume two scale-in rules, one that decreases capacity by 50% and one that decreases capacity by three instances. If the first rule results in five instances and the second rule results in seven, autoscale scales in to seven instances.
Each time autoscale calculates the result of a scale-in action, it evaluates whether that action would trigger a scale-out action. The scenario where a scale action triggers the opposite scale action is known as flapping. Autoscale might defer a scale-in action to avoid flapping or might scale by a number less than what was specified in the rule. For more information on flapping, seeFlapping in autoscale.
