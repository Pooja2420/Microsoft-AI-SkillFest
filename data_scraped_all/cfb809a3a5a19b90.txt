When youcreate an NFS volume, you can enable the LDAP with extended groups feature (theLDAPoption) for the volume. This feature enables Active Directory LDAP users and extended groups (up to 1024 groups) to access files and directories in the volume. You can use the LDAP with extended groups feature with both NFSv4.1 and NFSv3 volumes.
Note
By default, in Active Directory LDAP servers, theMaxPageSizeattribute is set to a default of 1,000. This setting means that groups beyond 1,000 are truncated in LDAP queries. To enable full support with the 1,024 value for extended groups, theMaxPageSize attribute must be modified to reflect the 1,024 value. For information about how to change that value, seeHow to view and set LDAP policy in Active Directory by using Ntdsutil.exe.

Azure NetApp Files supports fetching of extended groups from the LDAP name service rather than from the RPC header. Azure NetApp Files interacts with LDAP by querying for attributes such as usernames, numeric IDs, groups, and group memberships for NFS protocol operations.
When itâs determined that LDAP will be used for operations such as name lookup and fetching extended groups, the following process occurs:
Azure NetApp Files uses an LDAP client configuration to make a connection attempt to the AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services LDAP server that is specified in theAzure NetApp Files AD configuration.
If the TCP connection over the defined AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services LDAP service port is successful, then the Azure NetApp Files LDAP client attempts to âbindâ (sign in) to the AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services LDAP server (domain controller) by using the defined credentials in the LDAP client configuration.
If the bind is successful, then the Azure NetApp Files LDAP client uses the RFC 2307bis LDAP schema to make an LDAP search query to the AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services LDAP server (domain controller).
The following information is passed to the server in the query:Base/user DN(to narrow search scope)Search scope type (subtree)Object class (user,posixAccountfor users, andposixGroupfor groups)UID or usernameRequested attributes (uid,uidNumber,gidNumberfor users, orgidNumberfor groups)
Base/user DN(to narrow search scope)
Search scope type (subtree)
Object class (user,posixAccountfor users, andposixGroupfor groups)
user
posixAccount
posixGroup
UID or username
Requested attributes (uid,uidNumber,gidNumberfor users, orgidNumberfor groups)
uid
uidNumber
gidNumber
gidNumber
If the user or group isnât found, the request fails, and access is denied.
If the request is successful, then user and group attributes arecached for future use. This operation improves the performance of subsequent LDAP queries associated with the cached user or group attributes. It also reduces the load on the AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services LDAP server.
Considerations
You can enable the LDAP with extended groups feature only during volume creation. This feature can't be retroactively enabled on existing volumes.

The following table describes the Time to Live (TTL) settings for the LDAP cache. You need to wait until the cache is refreshed before trying to access a file or directory through a client. Otherwise, an access or permission denied message appears on the client.CacheDefault time outGroup membership list24-hour TTLUnix groups24-hour TTL, 1-minute negative TTLUnix users24-hour TTL, 1-minute negative TTLCaches have a specific time-out period calledTime to Live. After the time-out period, entries age out so that stale entries don't linger. Thenegative TTLvalue is where a lookup that has failed resides to help avoid performance issues due to LDAP queries for objects that might not exist.

TheAllow local NFS users with LDAPoption in Active Directory connections intends to provide occasional and temporary access to local users. When this option is enabled, user authentication and lookup from the LDAP server stop working, and the number of group memberships that Azure NetApp Files will support will be limited to 16.  As such, you should keep this optiondisabledon Active Directory connections, except for the occasion when a local user needs to access LDAP-enabled volumes. In that case, you should disable this option as soon as local user access is no longer required for the volume. SeeAllow local NFS users with LDAP to access a dual-protocol volumeabout managing local user access.

Steps
LDAP volumes require an Active Directory configuration for LDAP server settings. Follow instructions inRequirements for Active Directory connectionsandCreate an Active Directory connectionto configure Active Directory connections on the Azure portal.NoteEnsure that you have configured the Active Directory connection settings. A computer account will be created in the organizational unit (OU) that is specified in the Active Directory connection settings. The settings are used by the LDAP client to authenticate with your Active Directory.

LDAP NFS users need to have certain POSIX attributes on the LDAP server. Set the attributes for LDAP users and LDAP groups as follows:Required attributes for LDAP users:uid: Alice,uidNumber: 139,gidNumber: 555,objectClass: user, posixAccountRequired attributes for LDAP groups:objectClass: group, posixGroup,gidNumber: 555The values specified forobjectClassare separate entries. For example, in Multi-valued String Editor,objectClasswould have separate values (userandposixAccount) specified as follows for LDAP users:NoteIf the POSIX attributes are not set up correctly, user and group lookup operations may fail, and users may be squashed tonobodywhen accessing NFS volumes.You can manage POSIX attributes by using the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in. The following example shows the Active Directory Attribute Editor. SeeAccess Active Directory Attribute Editorfor details.

Optional - If you have large topologies, and you use the Unix security style with a dual-protocol volume or LDAP with extended groups, you can use theLDAP Search Scopeoption to avoid "access denied" errors on Linux clients for Azure NetApp Files.TheLDAP Search Scopeoption is configured through theActive Directory Connectionspage.To resolve the users and group from an LDAP server for large topologies, set the values of theUser DN,Group DN, andGroup Membership Filteroptions on the Active Directory Connections page as follows:Specify nestedUser DNandGroup DNin the format ofOU=subdirectory,OU=directory,DC=domain,DC=com. Multiple organizational units can be specified using a semicolon, for example:OU=subdirectory1,OU=directory1,DC=domain,DC=com;OU=subdirectory2,OU=directory2,DC=domain,DC=comSpecifyGroup Membership Filterin the format of(gidNumber=*). For example, setting(gidNumber=9*)searches forgidNumbersstarting with 9. You can also use two filters together:(|(cn=*22)(cn=*33))searches for CN values ending in 22 or 33.If a user is a member of more than 256 groups, only 256 groups will be listed.Refer toerrors for LDAP volumesif you run into errors.
