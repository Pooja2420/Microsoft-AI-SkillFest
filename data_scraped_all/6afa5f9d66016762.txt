To assist with creating Azure Resource Manager templates, you can export a template from existing resources as either aBicep fileor anARM JSON template. The exported template helps you understand the syntax and properties needed for resource deployment. To streamline future deployments, use the exported template as a starting point and customize it for your needs. While the export process generates a functional template, most exported templates require adjustments before they can be used for deployment.
Resource Manager enables you to pick one or more resources for exporting to a template. You can focus on exactly the resources you need in the template.
This article shows how to export templates through theportal. For other options, see:
Export template with Azure CLI
Export template with Azure PowerShell
REST API export from resource groupandREST API export from deployment history.
Choose the right export option
There are two ways to export a template:
Export from resource group or resource. This option generates a new template from existing resources. The exported template is a "snapshot" of the current state of the resource group. You can export an entire resource group or specific resources within that resource group.

Save from history. This option supports exporting only ARM JSON templates. It retrieves an exact copy of the template used for deployment, allowing you to select a specific deployment from the deployment history. After exporting, you candecompilethem into to Bicep files.

Depending on the option you choose, the exported templates have different qualities.
Export the template from a resource group or resource, when:
You need to capture changes to the resources that were made after the original deployment.
You want to select which resources are exported.
The resources weren't created with a template.
Export the template from the history, when:
You want an easy-to-reuse template.
You don't need to include changes you made after the original deployment.
Limitations
Export is not guaranteed to succeed. Export is not a reliable way to turn pre-existing resources into templates that are usable in production. It is better to create resources from scratch using hand-writtenBicep file,ARM templateorterraform.
When exporting from a resource group or resource, the exported template is generated from thepublished schemasfor each resource type. Occasionally, the schema doesn't have the latest version for a resource type. Check your exported template to make sure it includes the properties you need. If necessary, edit the exported template to use the API version you need.
Some password parameters might be missing from the exported templates. You need to checktemplate reference, and manually add these parameters before you can use the templates to deploy resources.
The export template feature doesn't support exporting Azure Data Factory resources. To learn about how you can export Data Factory resources, seeCopy or clone a data factory in Azure Data Factory.
To export resources created through classic deployment model, you mustmigrate them to the Resource Manager deployment model.
If you get a warning when exporting a template that indicates a resource type wasn't exported, you can still discover the properties for that resource. For resource properties, seetemplate reference. You can also look at theAzure REST APIfor the resource type.
There's a limit of 200 resources in the resource group you create the exported template for. If you attempt to export a resource group that has more than 200 resources, the error messageExport template is not supported for resource groups more than 200 resourcesis shown.
