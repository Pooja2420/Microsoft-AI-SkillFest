Kusto.Explorer is free software for download and use on your Windows desktop. Kusto.Explorer allows you to query and analyze your data with Kusto Query Language (KQL) in a user-friendly interface. This overview explains how to set up Kusto.Explorer, and describes the user interface you'll use.
With Kusto.Explorer, you can:
Query your data.
Search your dataacross tables.
Visualize your datain a wide variety of graphs.
Share queries and resultsby email or using deep links.
Installing Kusto.Explorer
Download and install the Kusto.Explorer tool from:https://aka.ms/ke
Download and install the Kusto.Explorer tool from:

Alternatively, access your Kusto cluster with a ClickOnce-enabled browser at:https://<your_cluster>/?web=0Replace <your_cluster> with your cluster URI (for example,help.kusto.windows.net.)
Alternatively, access your Kusto cluster with a ClickOnce-enabled browser at:https://<your_cluster>/?web=0Replace <your_cluster> with your cluster URI (for example,help.kusto.windows.net.)

Using Google Chrome and Kusto.Explorer
If Google Chrome is your default browser, installing the ClickOnce extension for Chrome is required.https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clickonce-for-google-chro/kekahkplibinaibelipdcikofmedafmb?hl=en-US
If your default browser is the Microsoft Edge, installing this extensionisn'trequired.
Validate your ClickOnce settings inMicrosoft Edge flag settings.
Overview of the user interface
The Kusto.Explorer user interface is designed with a layout based on tabs and panels, similar to that of other Microsoft products:
Navigate through the tabs on themenu panelto perform various operations
Manage your connections in theconnections panel
Create scripts to run in the script panel
View the results of the scripts in the results panel

Connections panel

The Connections pane shows all the configured cluster connections. For each cluster the databases, tables, and attributes (columns) that they store are shown. Select items (which sets an implicit context
for the search/query in the main panel), or double-click items to copy the name to the search/query panel.
If the actual schema is large (such as a database with hundreds of tables), you can search it by pressingCTRL+Fand entering a substring (case-insensitive) of the entity name you're looking for.
Kusto.Explorer supports controlling the Connection panel from the query window, which is useful for scripts. For example, you can start a script file with a command that instructs Kusto.Explorer to connect to the cluster/database the script queries, using the following syntax:
#connect cluster('help').database('Samples')

StormEvents | count
#connect cluster('help').database('Samples')

StormEvents | count
Run each line usingF5, or similar.
F5
Work Documents panel

The Work folders pane organizes your work folders in one place to make navigating your work easier. There are two types of work folders:
Unsaved work: lists folders for open query tabs that you may still be working on.
Tracked folders: lists folders from your local device that you can add as KQL libraries for easier access and management.
Menu panel
Home tab

The Home tab shows the most frequently used operations. It includes:
Query section

Query mode: Switches the query editor into aquery mode. Commands can be written and saved as queries (default)
Search mode: A single query mode where each command entered is processed immediately and presents a result in the result panel
Search++ mode: Allows searching for a term using search syntax across one or more tables. Learn more about usingSearch++ Mode
Share section

Visualizations section

For variable visualizations, see therender operator.
View section

Note
Data View Settings:
Kusto.Explorer keeps track of what settings are used per unique set of columns. When columns are reordered or removed, the data view is saved and will be reused whenever the data with the same columns is retrieved. To reset the view to its defaults, in theViewtab, selectReset View.

Tools tab

Table row colors
Kusto.Explorer tries to interpret the severity or verbosity level of each row in the results panel and color them accordingly. It does this by matching the distinct values of each column with a set of known patterns ("Warning," "Error," and so on).
To modify the output color scheme, or turn off this behavior, from theToolsmenu, selectOptions>Results Viewer>Verbosity color scheme.

Control the user identity connecting to Kusto.Explorer
The default security model for new connections is Microsoft Entra ID-Federated security. Authentication is done through the Microsoft Entra ID using the default Microsoft Entra user experience.
If you need finer control over the authentication parameters, you can expand the
"Advanced: Connection Strings" edit box and provide a validKusto connection stringvalue.
For example, users with a presence in
multiple Microsoft Entra tenants sometimes need to use a particular "projection"
of their identities to a specific Microsoft Entra tenant, which can be done through
the connection string (replace words IN CAPITALS with specific values):
Data Source=https://CLUSTER_NAME.kusto.windows.net;Initial Catalog=DATABASE_NAME;AAD Federated Security=True;Authority Id=AAD_TENANT_OF_CLUSTER;User=USER_DOMAIN
Data Source=https://CLUSTER_NAME.kusto.windows.net;Initial Catalog=DATABASE_NAME;AAD Federated Security=True;Authority Id=AAD_TENANT_OF_CLUSTER;User=USER_DOMAIN
AAD_TENANT_OF_CLUSTERis a domain name or Microsoft Entra tenant ID (a GUID) of the tenant in which the cluster is hosted. For example,contoso.com.
AAD_TENANT_OF_CLUSTER
contoso.com
USER_DOMAIN is the identity of the user invited into that tenant (for example,user@example.com).
user@example.com
Note
The domain name of the user is not necessarily the same as that of the tenant hosting the cluster.
