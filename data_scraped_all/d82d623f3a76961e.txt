ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 overview
ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018is an international standard for IT service management that defines requirements for the development, implementation, monitoring, maintenance, and improvement of an IT service management system. A related standardISO/IEC 20000-2:2019provides guidance on the application of service management systems. Moreover,ISO/IEC 27013:2015guidance on the integrated implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 was released for organizations planning to implement ISO/IEC 20000-1 when ISO/IEC 27001 is already implemented or planning to implement these two standards together. ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 is the only standard in the ISO/IEC 20000 family that results in a formal certification.
The ISO/IEC 20000-1 certificate demonstrates that a cloud service provider has implemented the right IT service management procedures to deliver efficient and reliable IT services that are subject to regular monitoring, review, and improvement. It helps organizations provide assurance to customers that their service requirements will be fulfilled.
