In API Management, groups are used to manage the visibility of products to developers in the developer portal. Products are first made visible to groups, and then developers in those groups can view and subscribe to the products that are associated with the groups.
API Management has the following immutable groups:
Administrators- Built-in group containing only the administrator email account provided at the time of service creation. Its membership is managed by the system; users can't be added to or removed from the group. The primary purpose of the administrator account is to access the developer portal's administrative interface tocustomize and publishthe portal content. Any user that hasAzure RBAC permissionsto customize the developer portal can authenticate as the administrator to customize the portal.NoteAt any time, a service owner can update the administratoremail settingsthat are used in notifications from your API Management instance.

Developers- Authenticated developer portalusersfall into this group. Developers are the customers that build applications using your APIs. Developers are granted access to the developer portal and build applications that call the operations of an API.

Guests- Unauthenticated developer portal users, such as prospective customers visiting the developer portal of an API Management instance fall into this group. They can be granted certain read-only access, such as the ability to view APIs but not call them.

In addition to these system groups, administrators can create custom groups oruse external groups in associated Microsoft Entra tenants. Custom and external groups can be used alongside system groups in giving developers visibility and access to API products. For example, you could create one custom group for developers affiliated with a specific partner organization and allow them access to the APIs from a product containing relevant APIs only. A user can be a member of more than one group.
This guide shows how administrators of an API Management instance can add new groups and associate them with products and developers.
In addition to creating and managing groups in the Azure portal, you can create and manage your groups using the API Management REST APIGroupentity.
