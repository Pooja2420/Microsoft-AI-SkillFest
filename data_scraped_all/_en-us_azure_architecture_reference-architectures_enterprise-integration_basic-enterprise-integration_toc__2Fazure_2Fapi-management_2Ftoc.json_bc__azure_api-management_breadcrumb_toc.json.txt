Components
Integration Servicesis a collection of services that you can use to integrate applications, data, and processes. In this solution, two of these services are used: Logic Apps and API Management. Logic Apps is used to facilitate message based integration between systems and facilitate connectivity with connectors. API Management is used to provide a faÃ§ade  for the backend services, allowing for a consistent interface for clients to interact with.Logic Appsis a serverless platform for building enterprise workflows that integrate applications, data, and services.  In this solution Logic Apps is used to orchestrate the calls to the backend services and provide easy connectivity through connectors reducing the need for custom code.API Managementis a managed service for publishing catalogs of HTTP APIs. You can use it to promote the reuse and discoverability of your APIs and to deploy an API gateway to proxy API requests. In this solution, API Management provides additional capabilities such as rate limiting, authentication, and caching to the backend services.  Additionally, API Management provides a developer portal for clients to discover and interact with the APIs.

Azure DNSis a hosting service for DNS domains.  Azure DNS is hosting the public DNS records for the API Management service. This allows clients to resolve the DNS name to the IP address of the API Management service.
Microsoft Entra IDis a cloud-based identity and access management service. Enterprise employees can use Microsoft Entra ID to access external and internal resources. Here Entra ID is used to secure the API Management service usingOAuth 2.0and the developer portal usingEntra B2C.
Scenario details
Integration Services is a collection of services that you can use to integrate applications, data, and processes for your enterprise. This architecture uses two of those services:Logic Appsto orchestrate workflows, andAPI Managementto create catalogs of APIs.
In this architecture, composite APIs are built byimporting logic appsas APIs. You can also import existing web services byimporting OpenAPI(Swagger) specifications orimporting SOAP APIsfrom WSDL specifications.
The API gateway helps to decouple front-end clients from the back end. For example, it can rewrite URLs, or transform requests before they reach the backend. It also handles many cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support, and response caching.
Potential use cases
This architecture is sufficient for basic integration scenarios in which the workflow is triggered by synchronous calls to backend services. A more sophisticated architecture usingqueues and eventsbuilds on this basic architecture.
Recommendations
Your specific requirements might differ from the generic architecture shown here. Use the recommendations in this section as a starting point.
API Management
Use the API Management Basic, Standard, or Premium tiers. These tiers offer a production service level agreement (SLA) and support scale-out within the Azure region. Throughput capacity for API Management is measured inunits. Each pricing tier has a maximum scale-out. The Premium tier also supports scale-out across multiple Azure regions. Choose your tier based on your feature set and the level of required throughput. For more information, seeAPI Management pricingandCapacity of an Azure API Management instance.
The API Management Consumption tier is not recommended for this solution because it doesn't support the developer portal which is required for this architecture.  The Developer Tier is specifically for non-production environments and is not recommended for production workloads.  A feature matrix detailing the differences between the tiers can be foundhere.
Each Azure API Management instance has a default domain name, which is a subdomain ofazure-api.net, for example,contoso.azure-api.net. Consider configuring acustom domainfor your organization.
azure-api.net
contoso.azure-api.net
Logic Apps
Logic Apps works best in scenarios that don't require low latency for a response, such as asynchronous or semi long-running API calls. If low latency is required, for example in a call that blocks a user interface, use a different technology. For example, use Azure Functions or a web API deployed to Azure App Service. Use API Management to front the API to your API consumers.
Region
To minimize network latency, put API Management and Logic Apps in the same region. In general, choose the region that's closest to your users (or closest to your backend services).
Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Review the SLAs for each servicehere
If you deploy API Management across two or more regions with Premium tier, it's eligible for a higher SLA. SeeAPI Management pricing.
Regularlyback upyour API Management configuration. Store your backup files in a location or Azure region that differs from the region where the service is deployed. Based on your RTO, choose a disaster recovery strategy:
In a disaster recovery event, provision a new API Management instance, restore the backup to the new instance, and repoint the DNS records.
In a disaster recovery event, provision a new API Management instance, restore the backup to the new instance, and repoint the DNS records.
Keep a passive instance of the API Management service in another Azure region. Regularly restore backups to that instance, to keep it in sync with the active service. To restore the service during a disaster recovery event, you need only repoint the DNS records. This approach incurs additional costs because you pay for the passive instance, but it reduces recovery time.

This approach incurs additional costs because you pay for the passive instance, but it reduces recovery time.
For logic apps, we recommend a configuration-as-code approach to backing up and restoring. Because logic apps are serverless, you can quickly recreate them from Azure Resource Manager templates. Save the templates in source control, integrate the templates with your continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. In a disaster recovery event, deploy the template to a new region.
If you deploy a logic app to a different region, update the configuration in API Management. You can update the API'sBackendproperty by using a basic PowerShell script.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
Although this list doesn't completely describe all security best practices, here are some security considerations that apply specifically to this architecture:
The Azure API Management service has a fixed public IP address. Restrict access for calling Logic Apps endpoints to only the IP address of API Management. For more information, seeRestrict inbound IP addresses.

Never check passwords, access keys, or connection strings into source control. If these values are required, secure and deploy these values by using the appropriate techniques.
If a logic app works with sensitive data, seeSecure access and data for workflows in Azure Logic Appsfor detailed guidance.
API Management manages secrets by using objects callednamed valuesorproperties. These objects securely store values that you can access through API Management policies. For more information, seeHow to use Named Values in Azure API Management policies.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
In general, use theAzure pricing calculatorto estimate costs. Here are some other considerations.
You're charged for all API Management instances when they're running. If you have scaled up and don't need that level of performance all the time, manually scale down or configureautoscaling.
Logic Apps uses a serverless model. Billing is calculated based on action and connector execution. For more information, seeLogic Apps pricing.
For more information, see the cost section inMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Operational Excellence
Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Operational Excellence.
Create separate resource groups for production, development, and test environments. Separate resource groups make it easier to manage deployments, delete test deployments, and assign access rights.
When you assign resources to resource groups, consider these factors:
Lifecycle. In general, put resources that have the same lifecycle in the same resource group.

UseAzure Resource Manager templatesto deploy the Azure resources, follow the infrastructure as Code (IaC) Process. Templates make it easier to automate deployments usingAzure DevOps Services, or other CI/CD solutions.
Consider staging your workloads, which means deploying to various stages and running validations at each stage before moving on to the next one. If you use this approach, you can push updates to your production environments in a highly controlled way and minimize unanticipated deployment issues.Blue-green deploymentandCanary releasesare recommended deployment strategies for updating live production environments. Also consider having a good rollback strategy for when a deployment fails. For example, you could automatically redeploy an earlier, successful deployment from your deployment history. The--rollback-on-errorflag parameter in Azure CLI is a good example.
--rollback-on-error
Put API Management and any individual logic apps in their own separate Resource Manager templates. By using separate templates, you can store the resources in source control systems. You can deploy the templates together or individually as part of a CI/CD process.
Each time you change a logic app's configuration or deploy an update through a Resource Manager template, Azure keeps a copy of that version and keeps all versions that have a run history. You can use these versions to track historical changes or promote a version as the logic app's current configuration. For example, you can roll back a logic app to a previous version.
API Management supports two distinct but complementary versioning concepts:
Versionsallow API consumers to choose an API version based on their needs, for example, v1, v2, beta, or production.

Revisionsallow API administrators to make nonbreaking changes in an API and deploy those changes, along with a change log to inform API consumers about the changes.
Revisionsallow API administrators to make nonbreaking changes in an API and deploy those changes, along with a change log to inform API consumers about the changes.
You can make a revision in a development environment and deploy that change in other environments by using Resource Manager templates. For more information, seePublish multiple versions of your API
You can also use revisions to test an API before making the changes current and accessible to users. However, this method isn't recommended for load testing or integration testing. Use separate test or preproduction environments instead.
UseAzure Monitorfor operational monitoring in both API Management and Logic Apps. Azure Monitor provides information based on the metrics configured for each service and is enabled by default. For more information, see:
Monitor published APIs
Monitor status, set up diagnostics logging, and turn on alerts for Azure Logic Apps
Each service also has these options:
For deeper analysis and dashboarding, send Logic Apps logs toAzure Log Analytics.

Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
To increase the scalability of API Management, addcaching policieswhere appropriate. Caching also helps reduce the load on back-end services.
To offer greater capacity, you can scale out Azure API Management Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers in an Azure region. To analyze the usage for your service, selectCapacity Metricon theMetricsmenu and then scale up or scale down as appropriate. The upgrade or scale process can take from 15 to 45 minutes to apply.
Recommendations for scaling an API Management service:
Consider traffic patterns when scaling. Customers with more volatile traffic patterns need more capacity.

Before you enable the load in production, always load-test your API Management service with a representative load.
Before you enable the load in production, always load-test your API Management service with a representative load.
With the Premium tier, you can scale an API Management instance across multiple Azure regions. This makes API Management eligible for a higher SLA and lets you provision services near users in multiple regions.
The Logic Apps serverless model means administrators don't have to plan for service scalability. The service automatically scales to meet demand.
