There are several steps to using the Azure Migration Tools to migrate a VMware deployment to Azure. This article is a map to the steps of the process that are documented for this scenario.
Note
This end-to-end VMware migration scenario documentation is currently in preview. For more information about using Azure Migrate, see theAzure Migrate product documentation.
Prerequisites
Make sure you check out thesupport matrixbefore getting started.
Discover
You need a list of all of the servers in your environment. To get the list, you have two choices:
Deploy an appliance that continually discovers servers. For more information, seeTutorial: Discover servers running in a VMware environment with Azure Migrate.

Use RVTools XLSX to discover servers and store the information in an .xlsx file. For more information, seeTutorial: Import servers running in a VMware environment with RVTools XLSX (preview).

Dependency analysis
Identify dependencies between on-premises servers so that you can identify groups of servers to migrate together.
For an overview, seeDependency analysis.
You can choose betweenagentlessandagent-basedanalysis.
Decide - build a business case (preview)
Build a business proposalusing the discovery and assessment tool to help you understand how Azure can bring the most value to your business.
Assess
Assess your VMware environment for moving toAzure Virtual Machinesor to the managedAzure VMware Solutionoffering.
Migrate
Before you begin your migration, you need tochoose whether to use an agent-based migration or agentless.
Depending on whether you choose agent-based or agentless migration, the next step would be to review the migration articles for your choice.
Agent-based:
