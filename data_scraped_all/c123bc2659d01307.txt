Switch to the simplified pricing tiers for Microsoft Sentinel

For many Microsoft Sentinel workspaces created before July 2023, there's a separate pricing tier for Azure Monitor Log Analytics in addition to the classic pricing tier for Microsoft Sentinel. To combine the data ingestion costs for Log Analytics and the data analysis costs of Microsoft Sentinel, enroll your workspace in a simplified pricing tier.
Prerequisites
The Log Analytics workspace pricing tier must be on pay-as-you-go or a Commitment tier before enrolling in a simplified pricing tier. Log Analytics legacy pricing tiers aren't supported.
Microsoft Sentinel was enabled on the workspace before July 2023. Workspaces that enable Microsoft Sentinel from July 2023 onwards are automatically set to the simplified pricing experience as the default.
You must haveContributororOwnerfor the Microsoft Sentinel workspace to change the pricing tier.
Change pricing tier to simplified
Classic pricing tiers are when Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics pricing tiers are configured separately and show up as different meters on your invoice. To move to the simplified pricing tier where Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics billing are combined for the same pricing meter,Switch to new pricing.
Microsoft Sentinel
Azure Resource Manager
Use the following steps to change the pricing tier of your workspace using the Microsoft Sentinel portal. Once you make the switch, reverting back to a classic pricing tier can't be performed using this interface.
From theSettingsmenu, selectSwitch to new pricing.
From theSettingsmenu, selectSwitch to new pricing.

Review your current tiers and consider theRecommendedtier where there's a mismatch in tiers.

To set the pricing tier using an Azure Resource Manager template, set the following values:

The following sample template configures Microsoft Sentinel simplified pricing with the 300 GB/day Commitment tier. To set the simplified pricing tier to pay-as-you-go, omit thecapacityReservationLevelproperty value and changecapacityreservationtopergb2018.

Only tenants that had Microsoft Sentinel enabled before July 2023 are able to revert back to classic pricing tiers. To make the switch back, set theMicrosoft.OperationsManagement/solutionsskuname tocapacityreservationand set thecapacityReservationLevelfor both sections to the appropriate pricing tier.

The following sample template sets Microsoft Sentinel to the classic pricing tier of pay-as-you-go and sets the Log Analytic workspace to the 100 GB/day Commitment tier.

Simplified pricing tiers for dedicated clusters
In classic pricing tiers, Microsoft Sentinel was always billed as a secondary meter at the workspace level. The meter for Microsoft Sentinel could differ from the overall meter of the workspace.
With simplified pricing tiers, the same Commitment tier and billing mode used by the cluster is set for the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Microsoft Sentinel usage is billed at the effective per GB price of that tier meter, and all usage is counted towards the total allocation for the dedicated cluster. This allocation is either at the cluster level or proportionately at the workspace level depending on the billing mode of the cluster. For more information, seeCost details - Dedicated cluster.
Dedicated cluster billing examples
Compare the following cluster scenarios to better understand simplified pricing when adding Microsoft Sentinel enabled workspaces to a dedicated cluster.

Example 1:A dedicated cluster ingestingmoredata than the Commitment tier level, but under the next highest tier (ideal).

The table shows two scenarios where the three workspace dedicated cluster is ideally ingesting more data than the 5,000 GB per day commitment tier. The first scenario uses cluster billing mode, the second uses workspace billing mode. In both scenarios, the first two workspaces, labeled A and B, are not Microsoft Sentinel enabled. Workspace A ingested 1 TB of data, while workspace B ingested 2 TB of data. In cluster billing mode, the combined 3 TB of Log Analytics usage is billed to the cluster resource. The Commitment tier detail shows the price equals to 3 TB multiplied by the Log Analytics effective per GB (per day) price of the Commitment tier. The price is also expressed as 0.6 units of the commitment tier per day rate. Workspace C is a Microsoft Sentinel enabled workspace that ingested 3 TB of data. Its commitment tier detail shows the price equals 3 TB multiplied by the Micorosoft Sentinel effective per GB (per day) price of the Commitment tier. The price is also expressed as 0.6 units of the commitment tier per day rate. In workspace billing mode, the primary difference is each portion of the ingested data is billed to the individual workspaces, but the grand total is the same (1.2 times the per day rate).

Example 2:A dedicated cluster ingestinglessdata than the Commitment tier level. Consider adding more workspaces to the cluster.

The table shows two scenarios where the three workspace dedicated cluster is ingesting less data than the 5,000 GB per day commitment tier. The first scenario uses cluster billing mode, the second uses workspace billing mode. In both scenarios, the first two workspaces, labeled A and B, are not Microsoft Sentinel enabled. Workspace A and B ingested 1 TB of data separately, while the Microsoft Sentinel enable workspace C ingested 2 TB of data (a total of 4 TB). Since the commitment tier is 5TB, there is 1 TB of unused ingestion to account for. In cluster billing mode, the combined 2 TB of Log Analytics usage adds the extra 1 TB of unused usage and is billed to the cluster resource. The Commitment tier detail shows the price equals to 3 TB multiplied by the Log Analytics effective per GB (per day) price of the Commitment tier. The price is also expressed as 0.6 units of the commitment tier per day rate. Workspace C is the Microsoft Sentinel enabled workspace that ingested 2 TB of data. Its commitment tier detail shows the price equals 2 TB multiplied by the Micorosoft Sentinel effective per GB (per day) price of the Commitment tier. The price is also expressed as 0.4 units of the commitment tier per day rate. In workspace billing mode, the primary difference is each portion of the ingested data is billed to the individual workspaces, and the unused 1 TB portion is billed to the cluster resource, but the grand total is the same (1.0 times the per day rate).

Keep in mind, the simplified effective per GB price for a Microsoft Sentinel enabled workspace now includes the log analytics ingestion cost. For the latestper dayandEffective Per GB Pricefor both types of workspaces, see:
Microsoft Sentinel pricing
Azure Monitor pricing.
Offboarding behavior
A Log Analytics workspace automatically configures its pricing tier to match the simplified pricing tier if Microsoft Sentinel is removed from a workspace while simplified pricing is enabled. For example, if the simplified pricing was configured for 100 GB/day Commitment tier in Microsoft Sentinel, the pricing tier of the Log Analytics workspace changes to 100 GB/day Commitment tier once Microsoft Sentinel is removed from the workspace.
Will switching reduce my costs?
Though the goal of the experience is to merely simplify the pricing and cost management experience without impacting actual costs, three primary scenarios exist for a cost reduction when switching to a simplified pricing tier.
Reduce Microsoft Sentinel costs with apre-purchase plan. Commit units of a pre-purchase plan don't apply to Log Analytics costs in the classic pricing tier. Since the entire simplified pricing tier is categorized as a Microsoft Sentinel cost, your effective spend with the simplified pricing tier is reduced with a pre-purchase plan that approaches your commitment tier.
The combinedDefender for Serversbenefit results in a total cost savings if utilized by the workspace.
If one of the separate pricing tiers for Log Analytics or Microsoft Sentinel was inappropriately mismatched, the simplified pricing tier could result in cost saving.
Is there ever a reason NOT to switch?
It's possible your Microsoft account team negotiated a discounted price for Log Analytics or Microsoft Sentinel charges on the classic tiers. You can't tell if this is so from the Microsoft Sentinel pricing interface alone. It might be possible to calculate the expected cost vs. actual charge in Microsoft Cost Management to see if there's a discount included. In such cases, we recommend contacting your Microsoft account team if you want to switch to the simplified pricing tiers or have any questions.
