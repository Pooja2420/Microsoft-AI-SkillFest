SeeMonitor Container Instancesfor details on the data you can collect for Container Instances and how to use it.
Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list ofall platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor.
For information on metric retention, seeAzure Monitor Metrics overview.
Supported metrics for Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups

Resource logs
This section lists the types of resource logs you can collect for this service. The section pulls from the list ofall resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor.
Supported resource logs for Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
ContainerEvent
Container Event Customer Logs.
ContainerInstanceLog
Container Instance Customer Logs.
Azure Monitor Logs tables
This section lists the Azure Monitor Logs tables relevant to this service, which are available for query by Log Analytics using Kusto queries. The tables contain resource log data and possibly more depending on what is collected and routed to them.
Container Instances has two table schemas, a legacy schema for Log Analytics and a new schema that supports diagnostic settings. The diagnostic settings feature is in public preview in the Azure portal. You can use either or both schemas at the same time.
Legacy Log Analytics tables
The following_CLtables represent the legacy Log Analytics integration. Users provide the Log Analytics workspace ID and key in the Container Group payload.
Note
Some of the columns in the following list exist only as part of the schema, and don't have any data emitted in logs. These columns are denoted with a description of 'Empty'.
Azure Monitor Log Analytics tables
The newer tables require use of a diagnostic setting to route information to Log Analytics. The diagnostic settings feature for Container Instances in the Azure portal is in public preview. The table names are similar, but without the _CL, and some columns are different.
Once this feature is enabled for a subscription, diagnostic settings can be applied to a container group. Applying diagnostic settings causes a container group to restart.
For example, here's how you can useNew-AzDiagnosticSettingcommand to apply a diagnostic settings object to a container group.
New-AzDiagnosticSetting
$log = @()
$log += New-AzDiagnosticSettingLogSettingsObject -Enabled $true -Category ContainerInstanceLog -RetentionPolicyDay 7 -RetentionPolicyEnabled $true
 
New-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name test-setting -ResourceId <container-group-resource-id> -WorkspaceId <log-analytics-workspace-id> -Log $log
$log = @()
$log += New-AzDiagnosticSettingLogSettingsObject -Enabled $true -Category ContainerInstanceLog -RetentionPolicyDay 7 -RetentionPolicyEnabled $true
 
New-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name test-setting -ResourceId <container-group-resource-id> -WorkspaceId <log-analytics-workspace-id> -Log $log

Activity log
The linked table lists the operations that can be recorded in the activity log for this service. These operations are a subset ofall the possible resource provider operations in the activity log.
For more information on the schema of activity log entries, seeActivity Log schema.
The following table lists a subset of the operations that Azure Container Instances may record in the Activity log. For the complete listing, seeMicrosoft.ContainerInstance resource provider operations.
