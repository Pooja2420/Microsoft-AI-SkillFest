This article describes the replication appliance used by theMigration and modernizationtool when migrating VMware VMs, physical machines, and private/public cloud VMs to Azure, using agent-based migration.
Overview
The replication appliance is deployed when you set up agent-based migration of VMware VMs or physical servers. It's deployed as a single on-premises machine, either as a VMware VM or a physical server. It runs:
Replication appliance: The replication appliance coordinates communications, and manages data replication, for on-premises VMware VMs and physical servers replicating to Azure.
Process server: The process server, which is installed by default on the replication appliance, and does the following:Replication gateway: It acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data from machines enabled for replication. It optimizes replication data with caching, compression, and encryption, and sends it to Azure.Agent installer: Performs a push installation of the Mobility Service. This service must be installed and running on each on-premises machine that you want to replicate for migration.

Appliance deployment
Note
If you're deploying in Azure Government, use the installation file to deploy the replication appliance.
Appliance requirements
When you set up the replication appliance using the OVA template provided in the Azure Migrate hub, the appliance runs Windows Server 2016 and complies with the support requirements. If you set up the replication appliance manually on a physical server, then make sure that it complies with the requirements.
MySQL installation
MySQL must be installed on the replication appliance machine. It can be installed using one of these methods.
URL access
The replication appliance needs access to these URLs in the Azure public cloud.
*.backup.windowsazure.com
*.store.core.windows.net
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com
https://management.azure.com
*.services.visualstudio.com

Azure Government URL access
The replication appliance needs access to these URLs in Azure Government.
*.backup.windowsazure.us
*.store.core.windows.net
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.us

Note
If your Migrate project has private endpoint connectivity, you will need access to the following URLs over and above private link access:
*.blob.core.windows.com- To access the storage account that stores replicated data. This is optional and is not required if the storage account has a private endpoint attached.
*.blob.core.windows.com

Port access
Replication process
When you enable replication for a VM, initial replication to Azure storage begins, using the specified replication policy.
Traffic replicates to Azure storage public endpoints over the internet. Replicating traffic over a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) from an on-premises site to Azure isn't supported.
After initial replication finishes, delta replication begins. Tracked changes for a machine are logged.
Communication happens as follows:VMs communicate with the replication appliance on port HTTPS 443 inbound, for replication management.The replication appliance orchestrates replication with Azure over port HTTPS 443 outbound.VMs send replication data to the process server (running on the replication appliance) on port HTTPS 9443 inbound. This port can be modified.The process server receives replication data, optimizes, and encrypts it, and sends it to Azure storage over port 443 outbound.
VMs communicate with the replication appliance on port HTTPS 443 inbound, for replication management.
The replication appliance orchestrates replication with Azure over port HTTPS 443 outbound.
VMs send replication data to the process server (running on the replication appliance) on port HTTPS 9443 inbound. This port can be modified.
The process server receives replication data, optimizes, and encrypts it, and sends it to Azure storage over port 443 outbound.
The replication data logs first land in a cache storage account in Azure. These logs are processed and the data is stored in an Azure managed disk.

Appliance upgrades
The appliance is upgraded manually from the Azure Migrate hub. We recommend that you always run the latest version.
In Azure Migrate > Servers, databases and web apps> Migration and modernization > Overview > Migration > Infrastructure servers  selectConfiguration servers.
InConfiguration serversscreen, a link appears inAgent Versionwhen a new version of the replication appliance is available.
Download the installer to the replication appliance machine, and install the upgrade. The installer detects the version currently running on the appliance.
