On February 15, 2024, theEA portalretired. It's now read only. All EA customers and partners use Cost Management + Billing in the Azure portal to manage their enrollments.
This article explains the common tasks that an Enterprise Agreement (EA) administrator accomplishes in theAzure portal. A direct enterprise agreement is signed between Microsoft and an enterprise agreement customer. Conversely, an indirect EA is one where a customer signs an agreement with a Microsoft partner. This article is applicable for both direct and indirect EA customers.
Manage your enrollment
To start managing the EA enrollment, the initial enterprise administrator signs in to theAzure portalâ¯using the account where they received the invitation email.
If you're set up as the enterprise administrator, then go toâ¯the Azure portal and sign in with your work, school, or Microsoft account.
If you have more than one billing account, select a billing account from billing scope menu. You can view your billing account properties and policy from the left menu.
Check out theEA admin manage enrollmentvideo. It's part of theEnterprise Customer Billing Experience in the Azure portalseries of videos.
Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeNew name for Azure AD.
Select a billing scope
Enterprise agreements and the customers accessing the agreements can have multiple enrollments. A user can have access to multiple enrollment scopes (billing account scopes). All the information and activity in the Azure portal are in the context of a billing account scope. It's important that the enterprise administrator first selects a billing scope and then does administrative tasks.
To select a billing scope
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forCost Management + Billingand select it.
SelectBilling scopesfrom the navigation menu and then select the billing account that you want to work with.
Activate your enrollment
To activate your enrollment, the initial enterprise administrator signs in to the Azure portal using their work, school, or Microsoft account.
If you're set up as the enterprise administrator, you don't need to receive the activation email. You can sign in to the Azure portal and activate the enrollment.
To activate an enrollment
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forCost Management + Billingand select it.
Select the enrollment that you want to activate.
Once the enrollment is selected, status of enrollment is changed to active.
You can view the status of enrollment underEssentialson Summary view.
View enrollment details
An Azure enterprise administrator (EA admin) can view and manage enrollment properties and policy to ensure that enrollment settings are correctly configured.
To view enrollment properties
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the navigation menu, underSettings, selectProperties.
View the billing account information.
View and manage enrollment policies
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the navigation menu, selectPolicies.
Enable or disable policies by selectingOnorOff.
For more information about the department admin (DA) and account owner (AO) view charges policy settings, seePricing for different user roles.
Enterprise agreements have an authorization (previously labeled authentication) level set that determines which types of users can be added as EA account owners for the enrollment. There are four authorization levels available.
Microsoft Account only - For organizations that want to use, create, and manage users through Microsoft accounts.
Work or School Account only - For organizations that set up Microsoft Entra ID with Federation to the Cloud and all accounts are on a single tenant.
Work or School Account Cross Tenant - For organizations that set up Microsoft Entra ID with Federation to the Cloud and have accounts in multiple tenants.
Mixed Mode - Allows you to add users with Microsoft Account and/or with a Work or School Account.
The first work or school account added to the enrollment determines thedefaultdomain. To add a work or school account with another tenant, you must change the authorization level under the enrollment to cross-tenant authentication.
Ensure that the authorization level set for the EA allows you to create a new EA account owner using the subscription account administrator noted previously. For example:
If the subscription account administrator has an email address domain of@outlook.com, then the EA must have its authorization level set to eitherMicrosoft Account OnlyorMixed Mode.
@outlook.com
If the subscription account administrator has an email address domain of@<YourAzureADTenantPrimaryDomain.com>, then the EA must have its authorization level set to eitherWork or School Account onlyorWork or School Account Cross Tenant. The ability to create a new EA account owner depends on whether the EA's default domain is the same as the subscription account administrator's email address domain.
@<YourAzureADTenantPrimaryDomain.com>
Microsoft accounts must have an associated ID created athttps://signup.live.com.
Work or school accounts are available to organizations that set up Microsoft Entra ID with federation and where all accounts are on a single tenant. Users can be added with work or school federated user authentication if the company's internal Microsoft Entra ID is federated.
If your organization doesn't use Microsoft Entra ID federation, you can't use your work or school email address. Instead, register or create a new email address and register it as a Microsoft account.
Add another enterprise administrator
Only existing EA admins can create other enterprise administrators. Use one of the following options, based on your situation.
If you're already an enterprise administrator
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the left menu, selectAccess Control (IAM).
In the top menu, select+ Add, and then selectEnterprise administrator.
Complete the Add role assignment form and then selectAdd.
Make sure that you have the user's account details and preferred authentication method handy, such as a work, school, or Microsoft account.
An EA admin can manage access for existing enterprise administrators by selecting the ellipsis (â¦) symbol to right of each user. They canEditandDeleteexisting users.
If you're not an enterprise administrator
If you're not an EA admin, contact your EA admin to request that they add you to an enrollment. The EA admin uses the preceding steps to add you as an enterprise administrator. After you're added to an enrollment, you receive an activation email.
If your enterprise administrator can't help you
If your enterprise administrator can't assist you, create anAzure support request. Provide the following information:
Enrollment number
Account details and authentication type (work, school, or Microsoft account)
Approval from an existing enterprise administrator
Note
We recommend that you have at least one active Enterprise Administrator at all times. If no active Enterprise Administrator is available, contact your partner to change the contact information on the Volume License agreement. Your partner can make changes to the customer contact information by using the Contact Information Change Request (CICR) process available in the eAgreements (VLCM) tool.
Any new EA administrator account created using the CICR process is assigned read-only permissions to the enrollment in the Azure portal. To elevate access, create anAzure support request.
Create an Azure enterprise department
EA admins and department administrators use departments to organize and report on enterprise Azure services and usage by department and cost center. The enterprise administrator can:
Add or remove departments.
Associate an account to a department.
Create department administrators.
Allow department administrators to view price and costs.
A department administrator can add new accounts to their departments. They can also remove accounts from their departments, but not from the enrollment.

Add an account and account owner
The structure of accounts and subscriptions affect how they're administered and how they appear on your invoices and reports. Examples of typical organizational structures include business divisions, functional teams, and geographic locations.
After a new account is added to the enrollment, the account owner is sent an account ownership email that gets used to confirm ownership.
Check out theEA admin manage accountsvideo. It's part of theEnterprise Customer Billing Experience in the Azure portalseries of videos.
Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeNew name for Azure AD.

Change Azure subscription or account ownership
EA admins can use the Azure portal to transfer account ownership of selected or all subscriptions in an enrollment. When you complete a subscription or account ownership transfer, Microsoft updates the account owner.
Transferring one or more subscriptions from one EA enrollment to another EA enrollment requires abilling support ticket. For more information, seeProduct transfer support.
Before starting the ownership transfer, get familiar with the following Azure role-based access control (RBAC) policies:
When doing a subscription or account ownership transfers between two organizational IDs within the same tenant Azure RBAC policies and role assignments are preserved.
Cross-tenant subscription or account ownership transfers result in losing your Azure RBAC policies and role assignments.
Policies and administrator roles don't transfer across different directories. The destination enrollment account owner is assigned as the Subscription Owner role on the subscription.
To avoid losing Azure RBAC policies and role assignments when transferring subscription between tenants, ensure that theMove the subscriptions to the recipient's Microsoft Entra tenantselection remains cleared. This selection keeps the services, Azure roles, and policies on the current Microsoft Entra tenant and only transfers the billing ownership for the account.
Before changing an account owner:
View theAccounttab and identify the source account. The source account must be active.
Identify the destination account and make sure it's active.
To transfer account ownership for all subscriptions:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the left menu, selectAccounts.
Select anAccountand then to right of the row select the ellipsis (â¦) symbol.
SelectTransfer subscriptions.
On the Transfer subscriptions page, select the destination account to transfer to and then selectNext.
If you want to transfer the account ownership across Microsoft Entra tenants, select theYes, I would also like to move the subscriptions to the new account's Microsoft Entra tenantconfirmation.
Confirm the transfer and selectâ¯Submit.
To transfer account ownership for a single subscription:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the left menu, selectAzure subscriptions.
On the Azure Subscriptions page, to the right of a subscription, select the ellipsis (â¦) symbol.
SelectTransfer subscription.
On the Transfer subscription page, select the destination account to transfer the subscription and then selectâ¯Next.
If you want to transfer the subscription ownership across Microsoft Entra tenants, select theYes, I would like to also move the subscriptions to the to the new account's Microsoft Entra tenantoption.
Confirm the transfer and then selectSubmit.
Associate an account to a department
EA admins can associate existing accounts to departments in the enrollment.
To associate an account to a department
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the left menu, selectAccounts.
Select the ellipsis (â¦) symbol to the right side of any account and then selectEdit.
On the Edit account page, select aDepartmentfrom the list.
Selectâ¯Save.
Associate an account with a pay-as-you-go subscription
If you already have an existing school, work, or Microsoft account for an Azure pay-as-you-go subscription, you can associate it with your Enterprise Agreement enrollment.
To associate an account, you must have the EA administrator or department admin role.
To associate an existing account
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Enable Azure Marketplace purchases
To get a single view of all subscriptions and charges, we recommend that you enable Azure Marketplace purchases.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate toCost Management + Billing.
In the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then select a billing account scope.
In the left menu, selectPolicies.
UnderAzure Marketplace, set the policy toOn.
The setting applies to all account owners in the enrollment. It allows them to make Azure Marketplace purchases.
Visual Studio subscription transfer
When you transfer a Visual Studio subscription to an enrollment, it gets converted to anEnterprise Dev/Test subscription. After conversion, the subscription loses any existing monetary credit. So, we recommended that you use all your credit before you transfer it to your Enterprise Agreement.
Azure in Open subscription transfer
When you transfer an Azure in Open subscription to an Enterprise Agreement, you lose any unused Azure in Open credits. We recommended that you use all your credit for the Azure in Open subscription before you transfer it to your Enterprise Agreement.
Subscription transfers with support plans
If you try to transfer an existing Microsoft Online Support Agreement (MOSA) subscription that has a support plan to an Enterprise Agreement without one, the subscription doesn't automatically transfer. You need to repurchase a support plan for your EA enrollment during the grace period, which is by the end of the following month.
Manage department and account spending with budgets
EA customers can set budgets for each department and account under an enrollment. Budgets in Cost Management help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. They help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs, and to monitor how spending progresses over time. You can configure alerts based on your actual cost or forecasted cost to ensure that your spending is within your organizational spend limit. When the budget thresholds are exceeded, only notifications are triggered. None of your resources are affected and your consumption isn't stopped. You can use budgets to compare and track spending as you analyze costs. For more information about how to create budgets, seeTutorial: Create and manage budgets.
Enterprise Agreement user roles
The Azure portal helps you to administer your Azure EA costs and usage. There are three main EA roles:
Enterprise Agreement (EA) admin
Department administrator
Account owner
Each role has a different level of access and authority. For more information about user roles, seeâ¯Enterprise user roles.
Add an Azure EA account
An Azure EA account is an organizational unit in the Azure portal. In the Azure portal, it's anaccount. Its use is to administer subscriptions and for reporting. To access and use Azure services, you need to create an account or have one created for you. For more information about accounts, seeAdd an account.
Enable the Enterprise Dev/Test offer
As an EA admin, you can allow account owners in your organization to create subscriptions based on the EA Dev/Test offer. To do so, select theDev/Testoption in the Edit account window. After you select the Dev/Test option, let the account owner know so that they can create EA Dev/Test subscriptions needed for their teams of Dev/Test subscribers. The offer enables active Visual Studio subscribers to run development and testing workloads on Azure at special Dev/Test rates. It provides access to the full gallery of Dev/Test images including Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.
Note
The Enterprise Dev/Test Offer isn't available for Azure Government customers. If you're an Azure Government customer, your can't enable the Dev/Test option.

In the Edit account window, selectDev/Testand then selectSave.

When a user is added as an account owner, any Azure subscriptions associated with the user that is based on either the pay-as-you-go Dev/Test offer or the monthly credit offers for Visual Studio subscribers get converted to theEnterprise Dev/Testoffer. Subscriptions based on other offer types, such as pay-as-you-go, associated with the account owner get converted to Microsoft Azure Enterprise offers.
Create a subscription
You can use subscriptions to give teams in your organization access to development environments and projects. For example:
Test
Production
Development
Staging
When you create different subscriptions for each application environment, you help secure each environment. As an account owner, you can create multiple subscriptions and assign different Subscription Owners for each subscription.
Check out theEA admin manage subscriptionsvideo. It's part of theEnterprise Customer Billing Experience in the Azure portalseries of videos.
Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeNew name for Azure AD.
Warning
You will not be able to create new subscriptions or transfer existing subscriptions from an enrollment account if the UPN is deleted from Entra ID.
Add a subscription
A user must have at least one of the following roles to create a new subscription:
An Enterprise Administrator can create a new subscription under any active enrollment account
An Account Owner can create new subscriptions within their enrollment account
The first time you add a subscription to your account, you're asked to accept the Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA) and a rate plan. Although they aren't applicable to Enterprise Agreement customers, the MOSA and the rate plan are required to create your subscription. Your Microsoft Azure Enterprise Agreement Enrollment Amendment supersedes the preceding items and your contractual relationship doesn't change. When prompted, select the option that indicates you accept the terms.
Microsoft Azure Enterpriseâ¯is the default name when a subscription is created. You can change the name to differentiate it from the other subscriptions in your enrollment, and to ensure that it's recognizable in reports at the enterprise level.

You can also create subscriptions by navigating to the Azure Subscriptions page and selecting+ Add.
Create subscription in other tenant and view transfer requests
A user with the following permission can create subscriptions in another directory if they're allowed or exempted with subscription policy. For more information, seeSetting subscription policy.
Enterprise Administrator
Account owner
When you try to create a subscription for someone in a directory outside of the current directory (such as a customer's tenant), asubscription creation requestis created.

When the request is created, the subscription owner (the customer) is sent an email letting them know that they need to accept subscription ownership. The email contains a link used to accept ownership in the Azure portal. The customer must accept the request within seven days. If not accepted within seven days, the request expires. The person that created the request can also manually send their customer the ownership URL to accept the subscription.
After the request is created, it's visible in the Azure portal atSubscriptions>View Requestsby the following people:
The tenant global administrator of the source tenant where the subscription creation request is made.
The user who made the subscription creation request for the subscription being created in the other tenant.
The user who made the request to create the subscription in a different tenant than where they make theSubscription â Alias REST APIcall instead of the Azure portal.
The subscription owner in the request who resides in the target tenant doesn't see this subscription creation request on the View requests page. Instead, they receive an email with the link to accept ownership of the subscription in the target tenant.

Anyone with access to view the request can view its details. In the request details, theAccept ownership URLis visible. You can copy it to manually share it with the subscription owner in the target tenant for subscription ownership acceptance.

Azure sponsorship offer
The Azure sponsorship offer is a limited sponsored Microsoft Azure account. It's available by e-mail invitation only to limited customers selected by Microsoft. If you're entitled to the Microsoft Azure sponsorship offer, you receive an e-mail invitation to your account ID.
Note
As explained atMicrosoft Azure EA Sponsorship, when your Azure EA Sponsorship (Offer MS-AZR-0136p) terminates, your subscription under the offer is converted automatically to your original Enterprise Agreement (MS-AZR-0017P).
Only offer MS-AZR-0017P subscriptions appear athttps://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.comwhen the account is sponsored.
The Enterprise Dev/Test (offer MS-AZR-0148P) isn't suitable for the Azure sponsorship offer. If you have an Enterprise Dev/Test (offer MS-AZR-0148P), you must convert it to MS-AZR-0017P for it to appear athttps://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com.
If you need assistance, create aâ¯support requestin the Azure portal.
Convert to work or school account authentication
Azure Enterprise users can convert from a Microsoft Account (MSA) or Live ID to a Work or School Account. A Work or School Account uses the Microsoft Entra authentication type.
To begin
Add the work or school account to the Azure portal with the needed roles.
If you get errors, the account might not be valid in Microsoft Entra ID. Azure uses User Principal Name (UPN), which isn't always identical to the email address.
Authenticate to the Azure portal using the work or school account.
To convert subscriptions from Microsoft accounts to work or school accounts
Sign in to the Azure portal using the Microsoft account that owns the subscriptions.
Use an account ownership transfer to move to the new account.
The Microsoft account should be free from any active subscriptions and can be deleted.
Any deleted accounts remain viewable in the Azure portal with inactive status for historic billing reasons. You can filter it out of the view by selectingShow only active accounts.
Pay your overage with Azure Prepayment
To apply your Azure Prepayment to overages, you must meet the following criteria:
You incurred overage charges that weren't paid and are within three months of the invoice bill date.
Your available Azure Prepayment amount covers the full number of incurred charges, including all past unpaid Azure invoices.
The billing term that you want to complete must be fully closed. Billing fully closes after the fifth day of each month.
The billing period that you want to offset must be fully closed.
Your Azure Prepayment Discount (APD) is based on the actual new Prepayment minus any funds planned for the previous consumption. This requirement applies only to overage charges incurred. It's only valid for services that consume Azure Prepayment, so doesn't apply to Azure Marketplace charges. Azure Marketplace charges are billed separately.
To complete an overage offset, you or the account team can open a support request. An emailed approval from your enterprise administrator or Bill to Contact is required.
Move charges to another enrollment
Usage data is only moved when a transfer is backdated. There are two options to move usage data from one enrollment to another:
Account transfers from one enrollment to another enrollment
Enrollment transfers from one enrollment to another enrollment
For either option, you must submit asupport requestto the EA Support Team for assistance. â
