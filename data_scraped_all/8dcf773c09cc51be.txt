In this article
Microsoft Sentinel gives you a few ways touse threat intelligence feedsto enhance your security analysts' ability to detect and prioritize known threats:
Use one of many available integratedthreat intelligence platform (TIP) products.
Connect toTAXII serversto take advantage of any STIX-compatible threat intelligence source.
Connect directly to theMicrosoft Defender Threat Intelligencefeed.
Make use of any custom solutions that can communicate directly with theThreat Intelligence Upload Indicators API.
Connect to threat intelligence sources from playbooks to enrich incidents with threat intelligence information that can help direct investigation and response actions.
Tip
If you have multiple workspaces in the same tenant, such as forManaged Security Service Providers (MSSPs), it might be more cost effective to connect threat indicators only to the centralized workspace.
When you have the same set of threat indicators imported into each separate workspace, you can run cross-workspace queries to aggregate threat indicators across your workspaces. Correlate them within your MSSP incident detection, investigation, and hunting experience.
TAXII threat intelligence feeds
To connect to TAXII threat intelligence feeds, follow the instructions toconnect Microsoft Sentinel to STIX/TAXII threat intelligence feeds, together with the data supplied by each vendor. You might need to contact the vendor directly to obtain the necessary data to use with the connector.
