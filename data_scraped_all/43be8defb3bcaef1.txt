To view a usage summary, price sheet, and download reports, seeReview usage charges.
View and download invoice
As a direct EA customer, you can view and download your Azure EA invoice in the Azure portal. It's a self-serve capability and an EA admin of a direct EA enrollment has access to manage invoices. Your invoice is a representation of your bill and should be reviewed for accuracy. For more information, seeDownload or view your Azure billing invoice.
Azure Prepayment and unbilled usage
Azure Prepayment, previously called monetary commitment, is an amount paid up front for Azure services. The Azure Prepayment is consumed as services are used. First-party Azure services are billed against the Azure Prepayment. However, some charges are billed separately, and Azure Marketplace services don't consume Azure Prepayment.
For more information about paying overages with Azure Prepayment, seePay your overage with your Azure Prepayment.
View Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)
You view and track your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) in the Azure portal. If your organization has a MACC for an EA billing account, you can check important aspects of your commitment, including start and end dates, remaining commitment, and eligible spend in the Azure portal. For more information, seeMACC overview.
