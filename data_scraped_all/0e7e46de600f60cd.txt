In theSprint 138 Updateof Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), the results pages forReleasepipelines has been enhanced with asummarized view of test resultsthat organizes related outcomes into a hierarchy. Also inBuild and release, we've added a way toview the detailsof the installed software on Microsoft-hosted agent pools.
InWorkyou can now view your team's work on the Work Items hub. Check out theFeatureslist below for more.

Wiki
Surface metadata for wiki pages and code preview using YAML tags
Adding metadata to documentation can help readers and search indexes pick up and surface meaningful content. In this update, any file that contains a YAML block in the beginning of the file will be transformed into a metadata table of one head and one row. The YAML block must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. It supports all basic data types, list, object as value. The syntax is supported inWikiand code file preview.
YAML Tags example:
---
tag: post
title: Hello world
---
---
tag: post
title: Hello world
---

YAML Tags example with list:
---
tags:
- post
- code
- web
title: Hello world

Work
View work for your team in the Work Items hub
Important
The team is staging the rollout of this feature more than normal. You should see the new pivot in theWork Itemshub of your organization soon.
You can now use theMy team(s)pivot on theWork Itemshub to find all of the work that is assigned to your team(s). With this pivot, you can quickly pick up work that is assigned to your team(s) or get a better idea of the work that you team(s) is responsible for. See theView and add work itemsdocumentation for more information.
Build and release
Check installed software on Microsoft-hosted agent pools
The Microsoft-hosted agent pools now report what software is installed on the image. Not sure if you're running on Python 3.6.5 or Python 3.7, or whether the image has the latest Git build? Check theDetailstab to find out. See theMicrosoft-hosted agentsdocumentation for more information.

Test
Review summarized test results
Important
To use this capability, you must have theNew release progress viewspreview featuresenabled on your profile.
During test execution, a test might spawn multiple instances of tests that contribute to the overall outcome. A few examples include: tests thatrerun due to failures, tests composed of an ordered combination of other tests (e.g. ordered test), or tests having different instances based on provided input parameter (data-driven tests). Since these tests are related they need to be reported together with the overall outcome derived based on the individual test outcomes. With this update, we introduce an improved version of test results presented as a hierarchy in theTeststab on a release. Let's look at an example.
Earlier, we introduced the ability torerun failed testsin theVS Testtask. However, we only reported on the last attempt of a test, which somewhat limited the usefulness of this feature. We have now extended this feature to report each instance of the test execution as an attempt. Additionally, the Test Management API now supports the ability to publish and query hierarchical test results. See theTest results APIdocumentation for more information.

Note
Metrics in the test summary section (e.g. Total tests, Passed, etc.), are computed using the root level of the hierarchy rather than each individual iteration of the tests.
Package
View package download and user metrics
You can now track the number of times packages are downloaded and the number of unique users that have downloaded them. Eachnpm installornuget restoreby a person or build agent is considered a download. This can help you measure the popularity and usage of packages that you create. For example, if you see the total downloads of a package remain constant for 2 to 3 weeks that may be indication that a package isn't actively being used.
npm install
nuget restore

Browse dependencies in npm packages
Previously, you used to be able to see the dependencies of a package, but you had to manually go back to the feed and locate it (if it was present at all). Now you can now click on a dependency (e.g. 'buffer-crc32' or 'normalize-path' in the right-hand column in the screenshot below) of an npm package and be taken directly to the list of available versions for that dependency.

Reporting
View VSTS dashboards within Microsoft Teams
You can now bring any of your VSTS dashboards intoMicrosoft Teamsto strengthen conversations with your team. To set this up, install theMicrosoft Teams Integration extensionand follow the instructions to select your dashboard. The selected dashboard will be added as a new tab in the Microsoft Teams channel. Dashboards are optimized for consumption and refresh every time you open the tab. You can drill into more details and take action in VSTS by clicking the links on selected widgets. See theMicrosoft Teams integrationdocumentation and thepost on Microsoft DevOps Blogfor more information.
Investigate build history through a new build dashboard widget
We have a new and improved build history widget that you can add to your dashboards. With this widget you can now view a history of builds from a specific branch on your dashboard and configure it on a public project for anonymous visitors.
Important
If you are looking for insights on your XAML builds, continue to use the older widget and read aboutmigrating from XAML builds to new builds. Otherwise, we recommend that you move to the newer widget.
Administration
Manage billing for your organization directly through the Azure Portal
As a Project Collection Administrator (PCA) you can nowset up billingorremove billingfor an organization directly through the Azure Portal. Look for the newSetup billingandRemove billingcommands on your organization in the portal.
