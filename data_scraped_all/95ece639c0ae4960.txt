By default,Azure Batch accountshave public endpoints and are publicly accessible. This article shows how to configure your Batch account to allow access from only specific public IP addresses or IP address ranges.
IP network rules are configured on the public endpoints. IP network rules don't apply to private endpoints configured withPrivate Link.
Each endpoint supports a maximum of 200 IP network rules.
Batch account public endpoints
Batch accounts have two public endpoints:
TheAccount endpointis the endpoint forBatch Service REST API(data plane). Use this endpoint for managing pools, compute nodes, jobs, tasks, etc.
TheNode management endpointis used by Batch pool nodes to access the Batch node management service. This endpoint only applicable when usingsimplified compute node communication.
You can check both endpoints in account properties when you query the Batch account withBatch Management REST API. You can also check them in the overview for your Batch account in the Azure portal:

You can configure public network access to Batch account endpoints with the following options:
All networks: allow public network access with no restriction.
Selected networks: allow public network access with allowed network rules.
Disabled: disable public network access, and private endpoints are required to access Batch account endpoints.
Access from selected public networks
In the portal, navigate to your Batch account.
UnderSettings, selectNetworking.
On thePublic accesstab, select to allow public access fromSelected networks.
Under access for each endpoint, enter a public IP address or address range in CIDR notation one by one.
SelectSave.
Note
After adding a rule, it takes a few minutes for the rule to take effect.
Tip
To configure IP network rules for node management endpoint, you will need to know the public IP addresses or address ranges used by Batch pool's internet outbound access. This can typically be determined with Batch pools created invirtual networkor withspecified public IP addresses.
Disable public network access
Optionally, disable public network access to Batch account endpoints. Disabling the public network access overrides all IP network rules configurations. For example, you might want to disable public access to a Batch account secured in a virtual network usingPrivate Link.
In the portal, navigate to your Batch account and selectSettings > Networking.
On thePublic accesstab, selectDisabled.
SelectSave.
Restore public network access
To re-enable the public network access, update the networking settings to allow public access. Enabling the public access overrides all IP network rule configurations, and will allow access from any IP addresses.
In the portal, navigate to your Batch account and selectSettings > Networking.
On thePublic accesstab, selectAll networks.
SelectSave.
