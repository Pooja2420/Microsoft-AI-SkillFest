In this article
In this article, you learn how to configure a zone-redundant Azure Cache instance using the Azure portal.
Note
In regions that don't support zones, the option to enable zone redundancy is disabled. For a list of regions that support zones, seeAzure Cache for Redis - zones supported regions.
Azure Cache for Redis Standard, Premium, and Enterprise tiers provide built-in redundancy by hosting each cache on two dedicated virtual machines (VMs). Even though these VMs are located in separateAzure fault and update domainsand highly available, they're susceptible to data center-level failures. Azure Cache for Redis also supports zone redundancy in its Standard, Premium, and Enterprise tiers. A zone-redundant cache runs on VMs spread across multipleAvailability Zones. It provides higher resilience and availability.

Automatic Zonal Allocation
Azure Cache for Redis automatically allocates zones to the cache on behalf of the user based on the number of nodes per shard and region's zonal support such that the cache is spread across multiple zones for high availability.
With this type of allocation, users don't need to worry about choosing zones manually. The actual zones that are allocated to the cache are abstracted from the user. Azure ensures that the cache's primary and replica nodes are spread across different zones for high availability.
The REST API spec for different types of zonal allocation can be found at:Create - ZonalAllocationPolicy.
If the propertyZonalAllocationPolicyis not passed in the request, Azure assigns its value for caches based on the region's zonal supportability and capacity.
ZonalAllocationPolicy
The supported values for the propertyZonalAllocationPolicyare:
ZonalAllocationPolicy
Automatic
This value can be passed to let Azure allocate zones automatically to the cache.
In the regions that support zones, it is selected as default option for caches starting with2024-11-01API version ifZonalAllocationPolicyisn't passed in the request.
ZonalAllocationPolicy
UserDefined
Users are allowed to pass this value only for Premium caches and can be passed in the request body while manually selecting the zones.
NoZones
Users are allowed to pass this value only for Premium caches. This is the only value supported in the regions that don't support zones.
This value can't be passed by user in the request for Standard caches, since they can't explicitly choose for non zonal standard caches.
It is selected as default option for caches ifZonalAllocationPolicyisn't passed in the request in cases:
ZonalAllocationPolicy
Regions that don't support zones (irrespective of API version used).
All Regions (irrespective of zonal support) if API version used is less than2024-11-01.
Important
Automatic Zonal Allocation can't be modified once enabled for a cache.
Important
Starting with 2024-11-01 API version, Automatic Zonal Allocation is chosen as default option for Premium, Standard caches. In rare cases, when sufficient zonal capacity is unavailable to at-least allocate two zones, and user does not passZonalAllocationPolicyin the request, Azure will create a non-zonal cache which user can verify by checking theZonalAllocationPolicyproperty in the response.Hence, it is recommended not to passZonalAllocationPolicyin the request body while creating the cache as it will enable Azure to choose the best option amongAutomatic,NoZonesfor the cache based on the region's zonal supportability and capacity. Otherwise, users can passZonalAllocationPolicyif they want to explicitly use a specific zonal allocation policy.

Zone Redundancy FAQ
Why can't I enable zone redundancy when creating a Premium cache?
Why can't I select all three zones during cache create?
Can I update my existing Standard or Premium cache to use zone redundancy?
How much does it cost to replicate my data across Azure Availability Zones?
Why can't I enable zone redundancy when creating a Premium cache?
Zone redundancy is available only in Azure regions that have Availability Zones. SeeAzure regions with Availability Zonesfor the latest list.
Why can't I select all three zones during cache create?
A Premium cache has one primary and one replica node by default. To configure zone redundancy for more than two Availability Zones, you need to addmore replicasto the cache you're creating. The total number of availability zones must not exceed the combined count of nodes within the cache, including both the primary and replica nodes.
Can I update my existing Standard or Premium cache to use zone redundancy?
Yes, updating an existing Standard or Premium cache to use zone redundancy is supported in-place. Users can enable it by navigating to theAdvanced settingson the Resource menu and selectingAllocate Zones automaticallycheck-box followed by the save button. You can't disable zone redundancy once you enable it.

How much does it cost to replicate my data across Azure Availability Zones?
When your cache uses zone redundancy configured with multiple Availability Zones, data is replicated from the primary cache node in one zone to the other nodes in another zone. The data transfer charge is the network egress cost of data moving across the selected Availability Zones. For more information, seeBandwidth Pricing Details.
