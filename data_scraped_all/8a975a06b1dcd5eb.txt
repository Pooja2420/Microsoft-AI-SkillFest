Remarks
You can specify a pool at the pipeline, stage, or job level.
The pool specified at the lowest level of the hierarchy is used to run the job.

pool: string # Specify a private pool by name.
pool: string # Specify a private pool by name.
poolstring.
pool

Remarks
Use this syntax to specify a private pool by name.
Note
If your pool name has a space in it, enclose the pool name in single quotes, likepool: 'My pool'.
pool: 'My pool'
Examples
To use a private pool with no demands:
pool: MyPool
pool: MyPool

pool: name, demands, vmImage
Full syntax for using demands and Microsoft-hosted pools.
pool:
  name: string # Name of a pool.
  demands: string | [ string ] # Demands (for a private pool).
  vmImage: string # Name of the VM image you want to use; valid only in the Microsoft-hosted pool.
pool:
  name: string # Name of a pool.
  demands: string | [ string ] # Demands (for a private pool).
  vmImage: string # Name of the VM image you want to use; valid only in the Microsoft-hosted pool.
Properties
namestring.Name of a pool.
name

pool: name, demands
Which pool to use for a job of the pipeline.
pool:
  name: string # Name of a pool.
  demands: string | [ string ] # Demands (for a private pool).
pool:
  name: string # Name of a pool.
  demands: string | [ string ] # Demands (for a private pool).

Remarks
Specify a Microsoft-hosted pool using thevmImageproperty.
vmImage
If your self-hosted agent pool name has a space in it, enclose the pool name in single quotes, likename: 'My pool'.
name: 'My pool'
Examples
To use a Microsoft-hosted pool, omit the name and specify one of the availablehosted images:
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
You can specify demands for a private pool using the full syntax.
To add a single demand to your YAML build pipeline, add thedemands:line to thepoolsection.
demands:
pool
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware # exists check for SpecialSoftware
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware # exists check for SpecialSoftware
Or if you need to add multiple demands, add one per line.
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands:
  - myCustomCapability   # exists check for myCustomCapability
  - Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands:
  - myCustomCapability   # exists check for myCustomCapability
  - Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
Checking for the existence of a capability (exists) and checking for a specific string in a capability (equals) are the only two supported operations for demands.
Exists operation
The exists operation checks for the presence of a capability with the specific name. The comparison is not case sensitive.
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: myCustomCapability # exists check for myCustomCapability
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: myCustomCapability # exists check for myCustomCapability
Equals operation
The equals operation checks for the existence of a capability, and if present, checks its value with the specified value. If the capability is not present or the values don't match, the operation evaluates to false. The comparisons are not case sensitive.
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
Agent variables as system capabilities
Self-hosted agents have the following system capabilities with similar names to agent variables, but they are not variables and don't require variable syntax when checking for exists or equals in a demand.
Agent.Name
Agent.Version
Agent.ComputerName
Agent.HomeDirectory
Agent.OS
Agent.OSArchitecture
Agent.OSVersion (Windows agents only)
