Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that helps you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features like access control, locks, and tags to secure and organize your resources after deployment.
The following video covers basic Resource Manager concepts:
Consistent management layer
When you send a request through any of the Azure APIs, tools, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request. It authenticates and authorizes the request before forwarding it to the appropriate Azure service. Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.
The following diagram shows the role that Resource Manager plays during Azure requests:

All capabilities that are available in the Azure portal are also available through PowerShell, the Azure CLI, REST APIs, and client SDKs. When APIs introduce new functionality, this reflects in the portal within 180 days of initial release.
Important
Resource Manager will stop supporting protocols older than TLS 1.2 on March 1, 2025. For more information, seeMigrating to TLS 1.2 for Azure Resource Manager.
Terminology
If you're new to Resource Manager, you might not be familiar the following terms:
resource- A manageable item that's available through Azure. Examples of resources include virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks. Resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tags are also resources.

resource group- A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization. SeeWhat is a resource group?.

declarative syntax- Syntax that lets you state, "Here's what I intend to create," without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. ARM templates and Bicep files are examples of declarative syntax. In those files, you define the properties for the infrastructure to deploy to Azure.

Use the template to deploy the resources consistently and repeatedly. SeeWhat are ARM templates?for an overview of how to deploy templates.

Understand scope
Azure provides four levels of management scope:management groups, subscriptions,resource groups, and resources. The following diagram visualizes these layers:

You apply management settings at any of these levels of scope. The level you select determines how widely the setting is applied. Lower levels inherit settings from higher levels. For example, when you apply apolicyto the subscription, the policy is applied to all resource groups and resources in your subscription. When you apply a policy on the resource group, that policy is applied to the resource group and all its resources. However, another resource group doesn't have that policy assignment.

You can deploy templates to tenants, management groups, subscriptions, or resource groups.
What is a resource group?
A resource group is a container that you use to manage related resources for an Azure solution. Using a resource group can help you to coordinate changes between resources that are related. For example, you can deploy an update to the resource group and have confidence that the resources are updated in a coordinated operation. Or, when you're finished with the solution, you can delete the resource group and know that all of the resources are deleted.
There are some important considerations when defining your resource group:
All resources in your resource group should share the same lifecycle. You deploy, update, and delete them together. For example, a server is one resource. If it needs to exist on a different deployment cycle, it should be in another resource group.

The resources in a resource group can be located in different regions than the resource group, but we recommend that you use the same location. SeeWhat location should I use for my resource group?.

A resource can connect to resources in other resource groups. This scenario is common when the two resources are related but don't share the same lifecycle. For example, you can have a web app that connects to a database in a different resource group.

When you delete a resource group, all resources in the resource group are also deleted. For information about how Resource Manager orchestrates those deletions, seeAzure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion.

Which location should I use for my resource group?
When you create a resource group, you need to provide a location for that resource group.
You might wonder why a resource group needs a location and why the resource group location matters if resources can have locations outside of a resource group.
The resource group stores metadata about resources. When you specify a location for the resource group, you're also specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you might need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.
Routing allcontrol plane operationsthrough the resource group's location can help the resource group to remain in a consistent state. When selecting a resource group location, it's recommended that you select a location close to where your control operations originate. Typically, this location is the one closest to you. This routing requirement only applies to control plane operations for the resource group. It doesn't affect requests that are sent to your applications.
If a resource group's region is temporarily unavailable, your resource requests will failover to a secondary region. However, if multiple regions are experiencing an outage or the resource's location is also unavailable, you may still be impacted. To reduce the impact of regional outages, it's recommended that you locate your resources and resource group in the same region. See theAzure Resource Graph table and resource type referencelist to view the resources and metadata that Resource Manager manages.
Azure Resource Manager enhances reliability during regional outages, ensuring high availability for both reads and writes with minimal disruption to customers. Service interruptions would only occur in the rare event that both the primary and backup regions of the resource group are affected.
For more information about building reliable applications, see theResiliency checklist for specific Azure services.
Resiliency of Resource Manager
Resource Manager is designed for resiliency and continuous availability. Resource Manager and control plane operations (requests sent tomanagement.azure.com) in the REST API:
management.azure.com
Distribute across regions. Resource Manager has a separate instance in each Azure region, meaning that if a Resource Manager instance fails in one region, this doesn't affect the service's availability in another region; the same applies to other Azure services. Although Resource Manager is distributed across regions, some services are regional. This distinction means that while the initial handling of the control plane operation is resilient, the request might be susceptible to regional outages when forwarded to the service.

Distribute across availability zones (and regions) in locations that have multiple availability zones. This distribution ensures that when a region loses one or more zones, Resource Manager can fail over to another zone or region. It continues to provide control plane capability for the resources.

This resiliency applies to services that receive requests through Resource Manager. Azure Key Vault is one service that benefits from this consistency.
Resolve concurrent operations
Concurrent resource updates can cause unexpected results. When two or more operations try to update the same resource at the same time, Resource Manager detects the conflict, allows only one operation to complete successfully, blocks the other operations, and returns an error. This resolution ensures that your updates are conclusive and reliable; you know the status of your resources and avoid any inconsistency or data loss.
For example, if you have two requests (A and B) that try to update the same resource at the same time and request A finishes before request B, then request A succeeds and request B fails. Request B returns the 409 error. After getting that error code, you can get the updated status of the resource and determine if you want to send request B again.
