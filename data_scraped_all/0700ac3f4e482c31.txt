As a service provider, you can useAzure Lighthouseto manage your customers' Azure resources from within your own Microsoft Entra tenant. Many common tasks and services can be performed across these managed tenants.
Tip
Azure Lighthouse can also be usedwithin an enterprise which has multiple Microsoft Entra tenants of its ownto simplify cross-tenant administration.
Understanding tenants and delegation
A Microsoft Entra tenant is a representation of an organization. It's a dedicated instance of Microsoft Entra ID that an organization receives when they create a relationship with Microsoft by signing up for Azure, Microsoft 365, or other services. Each Microsoft Entra tenant is distinct and separate from other Microsoft Entra tenants, and has its own tenant ID (a GUID). For more information, seeWhat is Microsoft Entra ID?
Typically, in order to manage Azure resources for a customer, service providers must sign in to the Azure portal using an account associated with that customer's tenant. In this scenario, an administrator in the customer's tenant must create and manage user accounts for the service provider.
With Azure Lighthouse, the onboarding process specifies users in the service provider's tenant who are assigned roles to delegated subscriptions and resource groups in the customer's tenant. These users can then sign in to the Azure portal, using their own credentials, and work on resources belonging to all of the customers to which they have access. Users in the managing tenant can see all of these customers by visiting theMy customerspage in the Azure portal. They can also work on resources directly within the context of that customer's subscription, either in the Azure portal or via APIs.
Azure Lighthouse provides flexibility to manage resources for multiple customers without having to sign in to different accounts in different tenants. For example, a service provider may have two customers with different responsibilities and access levels. Using Azure Lighthouse, authorized users can sign in to the service provider's tenant and access all of the delegated resources across these customers, according to theroles they've been assignedfor each delegation.

APIs and management tool support
You can perform management tasks on delegated resources in the Azure portal, or you can use APIs and management tools such as Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. All existing APIs can be used on delegated resources, as long as the functionality is supported for cross-tenant management and the user has the appropriate permissions.
The Azure PowerShellGet-AzSubscription cmdletshows theTenantIdfor the managing tenant by default. TheHomeTenantIdandManagedByTenantIdsattributes for each subscription allow you to identify whether a returned subscription belongs to a managed tenant or to your managing tenant.
TenantId
HomeTenantId
ManagedByTenantIds
Similarly, Azure CLI commands such asaz account listshow thehomeTenantIdandmanagedByTenantsattributes. If you don't see these values when using Azure CLI, try clearing your cache by runningaz account clearfollowed byaz login --identity.
homeTenantId
managedByTenants
az account clear
az login --identity
In the Azure REST API, theSubscriptions - GetandSubscriptions - Listcommands includeManagedByTenant.
ManagedByTenant
Note
In addition to tenant information related to Azure Lighthouse, tenants shown by these APIs may also reflect partner tenants for Azure Databricks or Azure managed applications.
We also provide APIs that are specific to performing Azure Lighthouse tasks. For more info, see theReferencesection.
Enhanced services and scenarios
Most Azure tasks and services can be used with delegated resources across managed tenants, assuming the appropriate roles are granted. Below are some of the key scenarios where cross-tenant management can be especially effective.
Azure Arc:
Manage hybrid servers at scale -Azure Arc-enabled servers:Onboard serversto delegated customer subscriptions and/or resource groups in AzureManage Windows Server or Linux machines outside Azure that are connected to delegated subscriptionsManage connected machines using Azure constructs, such as Azure Policy and taggingEnsure the same set ofpolicies are appliedacross customers' hybrid environmentsUse Microsoft Defender for Cloud tomonitor compliance across customers' hybrid environments

Azure Automation:
Use Automation accounts to access and work with delegated resources
Azure Backup:
Back up and restore customer data using Azure Backup. Currently, the following Azure workloads are supported: Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VM), Azure Files, SQL Server on Azure VMs, SAP HANA on Azure VMs. Workloads which leverageBackup vault(such as Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Blob, Azure Managed Disk, and Azure Kubernetes Services) currently aren't fully supported.
View data for all delegated customer resources inBackup center
Use theBackup Explorerto help view operational information of backup items (including Azure resources not yet configured for backup) and monitoring information (jobs and alerts) for delegated subscriptions. The Backup Explorer is currently available only for Azure VM data.
UseBackup reportsacross delegated subscriptions to track historical trends, analyze backup storage consumption, and audit backups and restores.
Azure Blueprints:
Use Azure Blueprints to orchestrate the deployment of resource templates and other artifacts (requiresadditional accessto prepare the customer subscription)
Azure Cost Management + Billing:
From the managing tenant, CSP partners can view, manage, and analyze pre-tax consumption costs (not inclusive of purchases) for customers who are under the Azure plan. The cost is based on retail rates and the Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) access that the partner has for the customer's subscription. Currently, you can view consumption costs at retail rates for each individual customer subscription based on Azure RBAC access.
Azure Key Vault:
Create Key Vaults in customer tenants
Use a managed identity to create Key Vaults in customer tenants
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
Manage hosted Kubernetes environments and deploy and manage containerized applications within customer tenants
Deploy and manage clusters in customer tenants
Use Azure Monitor for containersto monitor performance across customer tenants
Azure Migrate:
Create migration projects in the customer tenant and migrate VMs
Azure Monitor:
View alerts for delegated subscriptions, with the ability to view and refresh alerts across all subscriptions
View activity log details for delegated subscriptions
Log analytics: Query data from remote workspaces in multiple tenants (note that automation accounts used to access data from workspaces in customer tenants must be created in the same tenant)
Create, view, and managealertsin customer tenants
Create alerts in customer tenants that trigger automation, such as Azure Automation runbooks or Azure Functions, in the managing tenant through webhooks
Creatediagnostic settingsin workspaces created in customer tenants, to send resource logs to workspaces in the managing tenant
For SAP workloads,monitor SAP Solutions metrics with an aggregated view across customer tenants
For Azure AD B2C,route sign-in and auditing logsto different monitoring solutions
Azure Networking:
Deploy and manageAzure Virtual Networkand virtual network interface cards (vNICs) within managed tenants
Deploy and configureAzure Firewallto protect customersâ Virtual Network resources
Manage connectivity services such asAzure Virtual WAN,Azure ExpressRoute, andVPN Gateway
Use Azure Lighthouse to support key scenarios for theAzure Networking MSP Program
Azure Policy:
Create and edit policy definitions within delegated subscriptions
Deploy policy definitions and policy assignments across multiple tenants
Assign customer-defined policy definitions within delegated subscriptions
Customers see policies authored by the service provider alongside any policies they've authored themselves
Canremediate deployIfNotExists or modify assignments within the managed tenant
Note that viewing compliance details for non-compliant resources in customer tenants is not currently supported
Azure Resource Graph:
See the tenant ID in returned query results, allowing you to identify whether a subscription belongs to a managed tenant
Azure Service Health:
Monitor the health of customer resources with Azure Resource Health
Track the health of the Azure services used by your customers
Azure Site Recovery:
Manage disaster recovery options for Azure virtual machines in customer tenants (note that you can't useRunAsaccounts to copy VM extensions)
RunAs
Azure Virtual Machines:
Use virtual machine extensions to provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs
Use boot diagnostics to troubleshoot Azure VMs
Access VMs with serial console
Integrate VMs with Azure Key Vault for passwords, secrets, or cryptographic keys for disk encryption by usingmanaged identity through policy, ensuring that secrets are stored in a Key Vault in the managed tenants
Note that you can't use Microsoft Entra ID for remote login to VMs
Microsoft Defender for Cloud:

Current limitations
With all scenarios, be aware of the following current limitations:
Requests handled by Azure Resource Manager can be performed using Azure Lighthouse. The operation URIs for these requests start withhttps://management.azure.com. However, requests that are handled by an instance of a resource type (such as Key Vault secrets access or storage data access) aren't supported with Azure Lighthouse. The operation URIs for these requests typically start with an address that is unique to your instance, such ashttps://myaccount.blob.core.windows.netorhttps://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/. The latter are also typically data operations rather than management operations.
https://management.azure.com
https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net
https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/
Role assignments must useAzure built-in roles. All built-in roles are currently supported with Azure Lighthouse, except for Owner or any built-in roles withDataActionspermission. The User Access Administrator role is supported only for limited use inassigning roles to managed identities.  Custom roles andclassic subscription administrator rolesare not supported. For more information, seeRole support for Azure Lighthouse.
DataActions
For users in the managed tenant, role assignments made through Azure Lighthouse aren't shown under Access Control (IAM) or with CLI tools such asaz role assignment list. These assignments are only visible in the Azure portal in theDelegationssection of Azure Lighthouse, or through the Azure Lighthouse API.
az role assignment list
While you can onboard subscriptions that use Azure Databricks, users in the managing tenant can't launch Azure Databricks workspaces on a delegated subscription.
While you can onboard subscriptions and resource groups that have resource locks, those locks won't prevent actions from being performed by users in the managing tenant.Deny assignmentsthat protect system-managed resources (system-assigned deny assignments), such as those created by Azure managed applications or Azure Blueprints, do prevent users in the managing tenant from acting on those resources. However, users in the customer tenant can't create their own deny assignments.
Delegation of subscriptions across anational cloudand the Azure public cloud, or across two separate national clouds, is not supported.
