APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
API Management allows you to secure access to the backend service of an API using client certificates and mutual TLS authentication. This guide shows how to manage certificates in an Azure API Management service instance using the Azure portal. It also explains how to configure an API to use a certificate to access a backend service.
You can also manage API Management certificates using theAPI Management REST API.
Certificate options
API Management provides two options to manage certificates used to secure access to backend services:
Reference a certificate managed inAzure Key Vault
Add a certificate file directly in API Management
Using key vault certificates is recommended because it helps improve API Management security:
Certificates stored in key vaults can be reused across services
Granularaccess policiescan be applied to certificates stored in key vaults
Certificates updated in the key vault are automatically rotated in API Management. After update in the key vault, a certificate in API Management is updated within 4 hours. You can also manually refresh the certificate using the Azure portal or via the management REST API.
Prerequisites
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
If you have not created an API Management service instance yet, seeCreate an API Management service instance.
If you have not created an API Management service instance yet, seeCreate an API Management service instance.
You should have your backend service configured for client certificate authentication. To configure certificate authentication in the Azure App Service, refer tothis article.

Prerequisites for key vault integration
Note
Currently, this feature isn't available inworkspaces.
If you don't already have a key vault, create one. For steps to create a key vault, seeQuickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure portal.To create or import a certificate to the key vault, seeQuickstart: Set and retrieve a certificate from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal.

Enable a system-assigned or user-assignedmanaged identityin the API Management instance.
Enable a system-assigned or user-assignedmanaged identityin the API Management instance.
Configure access to key vault
In the portal, navigate to your key vault.
In the left menu, selectAccess configuration, and note thePermission modelthat is configured.
Depending on the permission model, configure either akey vault access policyorAzure RBAC accessfor an API Management managed identity.
To add a key vault access policy:
In the left menu, selectAccess policies.
On theAccess policiespage, select+ Create.
On thePermissionstab, underSecret permissions, selectGetandList, then selectNext.
On thePrincipaltab,Select principal, search for  the resource name of your managed identity, and then selectNext.
If you're using a system-assigned identity, the principal is the name of your API Management instance.
SelectNextagain. On theReview + createtab, selectCreate.
IfKey Vault firewallis enabled on your key vault, the following are additional requirements:
You must use the API Management instance'ssystem-assignedmanaged identity to access the key vault.
You must use the API Management instance'ssystem-assignedmanaged identity to access the key vault.
In Key Vault firewall, enable theAllow Trusted Microsoft Services to bypass this firewalloption.
In Key Vault firewall, enable theAllow Trusted Microsoft Services to bypass this firewalloption.
Ensure that your local client IP address is allowed to access the key vault temporarily while you select a certificate or secret to add to Azure API Management. For more information, seeConfigure Azure Key Vault networking settings.After completing the configuration, you may block your client address in the key vault firewall.

After completing the configuration, you may block your client address in the key vault firewall.
If the API Management instance is deployed in a virtual network, also configure the following network settings:
Enable aservice endpointto Azure Key Vault on the API Management subnet.
Configure a network security group (NSG) rule to allow outbound traffic to the AzureKeyVault and AzureActiveDirectoryservice tags.
For details, seeNetwork configuration when setting up Azure API Management in a VNet.
Add a key vault certificate
SeePrerequisites for key vault integration.
Important
When adding a key vault certificate to your API Management instance, you must have permissions to list secrets from the key vault.
Caution
When using a key vault certificate in API Management, be careful not to delete the certificate, key vault, or managed identity used to access the key vault.
To add a key vault certificate to API Management:
In theAzure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.

Otherwise, the certificate won't rotate automatically in API Management after an update in the key vault.

Caution
This change is effective immediately, and calls to operations of that API will use the certificate to authenticate on the backend server.
Tip
When a certificate is specified for gateway authentication for the backend service of an API, it becomes part of the policy for that API, and can be viewed in the policy editor.
Disable certificate chain validation for self-signed certificates
If you are using self-signed certificates, you will need to disable certificate chain validation for API Management to communicate with the backend system. Otherwise it will return a 500 error code. To configure this, you can use theNew-AzApiManagementBackend(for new backend) orSet-AzApiManagementBackend(for existing backend) PowerShell cmdlets and set the-SkipCertificateChainValidationparameter toTrue.
New-AzApiManagementBackend
Set-AzApiManagementBackend
-SkipCertificateChainValidation
True
$context = New-AzApiManagementContext -resourcegroup 'ContosoResourceGroup' -servicename 'ContosoAPIMService'
New-AzApiManagementBackend -Context  $context -Url 'https://contoso.com/myapi' -Protocol http -SkipCertificateChainValidation $true
$context = New-AzApiManagementContext -resourcegroup 'ContosoResourceGroup' -servicename 'ContosoAPIMService'
New-AzApiManagementBackend -Context  $context -Url 'https://contoso.com/myapi' -Protocol http -SkipCertificateChainValidation $true
You can also disable certificate chain validation by using theBackendREST API.
Delete a client certificate
To delete a certificate, select it and then selectDeletefrom the context menu (...).

Important
If the certificate is referenced by any policies, then a warning screen is displayed. To delete the certificate, you must first remove the certificate from any policies that are configured to use it.
