The asset inventory page of Microsoft Defender for Cloud shows thesecurity postureof the resources you connected to Defender for Cloud. Defender for Cloud periodically analyzes the security state of resources connected to your subscriptions to identify potential security issues and provides you with active recommendations. Active recommendations are recommendations that can be resolved to improve your security posture.
Defender for Cloud periodically analyzes the security state of resources connected to it. When resources have activesecurity recommendationsorsecurity alertsassociated with it, they appear in the inventory.
The Inventory page provides information about:
Connected resources. Quickly see which resources are connected to Defender for Cloud.
Overall security state: Get a clear summary about the security state of connected Azure, AWS, and GCP resources, including the total resources connected to Defender for Cloud, resources by environment, and a count of unhealthy resources.
Recommendations, alerts: Drill down into the state of specific resources to see active security recommendations and security alerts for a resource.
Risk prioritization: Risk-based recommendations assign risk levels to recommendations, based on factors such as data sensitivity, internet exposure, lateral movement potential, and potential attack paths.
Risk prioritization is available when the Defender CSPM plan is enabled.
Software. You can review resources by installed applications. To take advantage of the software inventory, either the Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) plan, or a Defender for Servers plan must be enabled.
The Inventory usesAzure Resource Graph (ARG)to query and retrieve data at scale. For deep custom insights, you can useKQLto query the inventory.
Review the inventory
In Defender for Cloud in the Azure portal, selectInventory. By default the resources are sorted by the number of active security recommendations.
Review the available settings:InSearch, you can use a free text search to find resources.Total resourcesdisplays the number of resources connected to Defender for Cloud.Unhealthy resourcesdisplays the number of resources with active security recommendations and alerts.Resource count by environment: Total of Azure, AWS, and GCP resources.

Review software inventory

SelectInstalled application
InValue, select the apps to filter on.
Total resources: The total number of resources connected to Defender for Cloud.
Unhealthy resources: Resources with active security recommendations that you can implement.Learn more about implementing security recommendations.
Resource count by environment: The number of resources in each environment.
Unregistered subscriptions: Any subscription in the selected scope that hasn't yet been connected to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Resources connected to Defender for Cloud and running those apps are displayed. Blank options show machines where Defender for Servers/Defender for Endpoint isn't available.
Filter the inventory
As soon as you apply filters, the summary values are updated to relate to the query results.
3 - Export tools
Download CSV report- Export the results of your selected filter options to a CSV file.
Open query- Export the query itself toAzure Resource Graph (ARG)to further refine, save, or modify the Kusto Query Language (KQL) query.
How does asset inventory work?
In addition to the predefined filters, you can explore the software inventory data from  Resource Graph Explorer.
ARG is designed to provide efficient resource exploration with the ability to query at scale.
You can useKusto Query Language (KQL)in the asset inventory to quickly produce deep insights by cross-referencing Defender for Cloud data with other resource properties.
How to use asset inventory
From Defender for Cloud's sidebar, selectInventory.

Use theFilter by namebox to display a specific resource, or use the filters to focus on specific resources.By default, the resources are sorted by the number of active security recommendations.ImportantThe options in each filter are specific to the resources in the currently selected subscriptionsandyour selections in the other filters.For example, if you've selected only one subscription, and the subscription has no resources with outstanding security recommendations to remediate (0 unhealthy resources), theRecommendationsfilter will have no options.

Examples using Azure Resource Graph Explorer to access and explore software inventory data
OpenAzure Resource Graph Explorer.

Query examples
To generate a basic list of installed software:
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| project id, Vendor=properties.vendor, Software=properties.softwareName, Version=properties.version
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| project id, Vendor=properties.vendor, Software=properties.softwareName, Version=properties.version
To filter by version numbers:
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| project id, Vendor=properties.vendor, Software=properties.softwareName, Version=tostring(properties.    version)
| where Software=="windows_server_2019" and parse_version(Version)<=parse_version("10.0.17763.1999")
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| project id, Vendor=properties.vendor, Software=properties.softwareName, Version=tostring(properties.    version)
| where Software=="windows_server_2019" and parse_version(Version)<=parse_version("10.0.17763.1999")
To find machines with a combination of software products:
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| extend vmId = properties.azureVmId
| where properties.softwareName == "apache_http_server" or properties.softwareName == "mysql"
| summarize count() by tostring(vmId)
| where count_ > 1
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| extend vmId = properties.azureVmId
| where properties.softwareName == "apache_http_server" or properties.softwareName == "mysql"
| summarize count() by tostring(vmId)
| where count_ > 1
To combine a software product with another security recommendation:
(In this example â machines having MySQL installed and exposed management ports)
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"
| extend vmId = tolower(properties.azureVmId)
| where properties.softwareName == "mysql"
| join (
    securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/assessments"
| where properties.displayName == "Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines" and properties.status.code == "Unhealthy"
| extend vmId = tolower(properties.resourceDetails.Id)
) on vmId
securityresources
| where type == "microsoft.security/softwareinventories"

) on vmId
