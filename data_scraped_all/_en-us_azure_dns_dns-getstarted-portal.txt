You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain. For example, if you purchased thecontoso.xyzdomain name from a domain name registrar, you can configure Azure DNS to host thecontoso.xyzdomain and resolvewww.contoso.xyzto the IP address of your web server or web app.
www.contoso.xyz
In this quickstart, you create a test domain, and then create an address record to resolvewwwto the IP address10.10.10.10.

Important
The names and IP addresses in this quickstart are examples that do not represent real-world scenarios. The private IP address 10.10.10.10 is used here with a public DNS zone for testing purposes.
You can also perform these steps usingAzure PowerShellor the cross-platformAzure CLI.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
For all portal steps, sign in to theAzure portal.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription is required.Create an account for free.
Sign in to the Azure portal
Sign in to theAzure portalwith your Azure account.
Create a DNS zone
A DNS zone contains the DNS entries for a domain. To start hosting your domain in Azure DNS, create a DNS zone for that domain name.
To create the DNS zone:
At the upper left, selectCreate a resource, enterDNS zoneintoSearch services and marketplaceand then selectDNS zone.
On theDNS zonepage, selectCreate.

On theCreate DNS zonepage, type or select the following values:Resource group: SelectCreate new, enterMyResourceGroup, and selectOK. The resource group name must be unique within the Azure subscription.Name: Typecontoso.xyzfor this quickstart example. The DNS zone name can be any value that isn't already configured on the Azure DNS servers. A real-world value would be a domain that you bought from a domain name registrar.Resource group location: Select a location for the new resource group. In this example, the location selected isWest US.
On theCreate DNS zonepage, type or select the following values:
Resource group: SelectCreate new, enterMyResourceGroup, and selectOK. The resource group name must be unique within the Azure subscription.
Name: Typecontoso.xyzfor this quickstart example. The DNS zone name can be any value that isn't already configured on the Azure DNS servers. A real-world value would be a domain that you bought from a domain name registrar.
Resource group location: Select a location for the new resource group. In this example, the location selected isWest US.
SelectReview + createand then selectCreate.It may take a minute to create the zone.
SelectReview + createand then selectCreate.

It may take a minute to create the zone.
Create a DNS record
Next, DNS records are created for your domain inside the DNS zone. A new address record, known as an 'A' record, is created to resolve a host name to an IPv4 address.
To create an 'A' record:
In the Azure portal, underResources, open thecontoso.xyzDNS zone.
In the Azure portal, underResources, open thecontoso.xyzDNS zone.
At the top of thecontoso.xyzDNS zone page, selectRecord setsand then select+ Add. TheAdd a record setwindow appears.
At the top of thecontoso.xyzDNS zone page, selectRecord setsand then select+ Add. TheAdd a record setwindow appears.
In theAdd a record setwindow, enter or select the following values:Name: Typewww. This record name is the host name that you want to resolve to the specified IP address.Type: SelectA. 'A' records are the most common, but there are other record types for mail servers ('MX'), IP v6 addresses ('AAAA'), and so on.Alias record set: ChooseNo.TTL: Enter1.Time-to-liveof the DNS request specifies how long DNS servers and clients can cache a response.TTL unit: SelectHours. The time unit for theTTLentry is specified here.IP address: For this quickstart example, enter10.10.10.10. This value is the IP address that the record name resolves to. In a real-world scenario, you would enter the public IP address for your web server.
In theAdd a record setwindow, enter or select the following values:
Name: Typewww. This record name is the host name that you want to resolve to the specified IP address.
Type: SelectA. 'A' records are the most common, but there are other record types for mail servers ('MX'), IP v6 addresses ('AAAA'), and so on.
Alias record set: ChooseNo.
TTL: Enter1.Time-to-liveof the DNS request specifies how long DNS servers and clients can cache a response.
TTL unit: SelectHours. The time unit for theTTLentry is specified here.
IP address: For this quickstart example, enter10.10.10.10. This value is the IP address that the record name resolves to. In a real-world scenario, you would enter the public IP address for your web server.
SelectAddto create the A record.
SelectAddto create the A record.
Since this quickstart is just for quick testing purposes, there's no need to configure the Azure DNS name servers at a domain name registrar. In a real production domain, you must enable users on the Internet to resolve the host name and connect to your web server or app. To accomplish this task, visit your domain name registrar and replace the name server records with the Azure DNS name servers. For more information, seeTutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS.
Test the name resolution
Now that you have a test DNS zone with a test 'A' record, you can test the name resolution.
To test DNS name resolution:
On thecontoso.xyz | Recordsetspage, copy one of the name server names from the name server list. For example: ns1-37.azure-dns.com.
On thecontoso.xyz | Recordsetspage, copy one of the name server names from the name server list. For example: ns1-37.azure-dns.com.

Open a command prompt, and run the following command:nslookup www.contoso.xyz <name server name>For example:nslookup www.contoso.xyz ns1-37.azure-dns.com.See the following example:
Open a command prompt, and run the following command:
nslookup www.contoso.xyz <name server name>
nslookup www.contoso.xyz <name server name>
For example:
nslookup www.contoso.xyz ns1-37.azure-dns.com.
nslookup www.contoso.xyz ns1-37.azure-dns.com.
See the following example:

The host namewww.contoso.xyzresolves to10.10.10.10, just as you configured it. This result verifies that name resolution is working correctly.
Clean up resources
When you no longer need the resources you created in this quickstart, remove them by deleting theMyResourceGroupresource group. Open theMyResourceGroupresource group, and selectDelete resource group.
Next steps
Create DNS records for a web app in a custom domain
