PowerShell cmdlets used during Azure Virtual Desktop setup
This section lists PowerShell cmdlets that are typically used while setting up Azure Virtual Desktop and provides ways to resolve issues that might occur while using them.
Error: New-AzRoleAssignment: The provided information does not map to an AD object ID
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName "admins@contoso.com" -RoleDefinitionName "Desktop Virtualization User" -ResourceName "0301HP-DAG" -ResourceGroupName 0301RG -ResourceType 'Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/applicationGroups'
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName "admins@contoso.com" -RoleDefinitionName "Desktop Virtualization User" -ResourceName "0301HP-DAG" -ResourceGroupName 0301RG -ResourceType 'Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/applicationGroups'
The user specified by the-SignInNameparameter can't be found in the Microsoft Entra tied to the Azure Virtual Desktop environment.
-SignInName
Make sure of the following things:
The user should be synced to Microsoft Entra ID.
The user shouldn't be tied to business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) commerce.
The Azure Virtual Desktop environment should be tied to correct Microsoft Entra ID.
Error: New-AzRoleAssignment: "The client with object ID does not have authorization to perform action over scope (code: AuthorizationFailed)"
The account being used doesn't have Owner permissions on the subscription.
A user with Owner permissions needs to execute the role assignment. Alternatively, the user needs to be assigned to the User Access Administrator role to assign a user to an application group.
The account being used has Owner permissions but isn't part of the environment's Microsoft Entra ID or doesn't have permissions to query the Microsoft Entra ID where the user is located.
A user with Active Directory permissions needs to execute the role assignment.
Error: New-AzWvdHostPool: The location is not available for resource type
New-AzWvdHostPool_CreateExpanded: The provided location 'southeastasia' is not available for resource type 'Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools'. List of available regions for the resource type is 'eastus,eastus2,westus,westus2,northcentralus,southcentralus,westcentralus,centralus'.
New-AzWvdHostPool_CreateExpanded: The provided location 'southeastasia' is not available for resource type 'Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization/hostpools'. List of available regions for the resource type is 'eastus,eastus2,westus,westus2,northcentralus,southcentralus,westcentralus,centralus'.
Azure Virtual Desktop supports selecting the location of host pools, application groups, and workspaces to store service metadata in certain locations. Your options are restricted to where this feature is available. This error means that the feature isn't available in the location you chose.
In the error message, a list of supported regions will be published. Use one of the supported regions instead.
Error: New-AzWvdApplicationGroup must be in same location as host pool
New-AzWvdApplicationGroup_CreateExpanded: ActivityId: e5fe6c1d-5f2c-4db9-817d-e423b8b7d168 Error: ApplicationGroup must be in same location as associated HostPool
New-AzWvdApplicationGroup_CreateExpanded: ActivityId: e5fe6c1d-5f2c-4db9-817d-e423b8b7d168 Error: ApplicationGroup must be in same location as associated HostPool
There's a location mismatch. All host pools, application groups, and workspaces have a location to store service metadata. Any objects you create that are associated with each other must be in the same location. For example, if a host pool is ineastus, then you also need to create the application groups ineastus. If you create a workspace to register these application groups, that workspace needs to be ineastusas well.
eastus
eastus
eastus
Retrieve the location where the host pool is created, and then assign the application group you're creating to that same location.
