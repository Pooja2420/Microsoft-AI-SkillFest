Azure AI Video Indexer is a service hosted on Azure. In some cases, the service must interact with other services to index video files. For example, a Storage account. In other cases, the service interacts with services when you orchestrate indexing jobs against Azure AI Video Indexer API endpoint when using your own service hosted on Azure. For example, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Web Apps, Logic Apps, and Functions.
Note
If you're already usingAzureVideoAnalyzerForMediaNetwork Service Tag, you might experience issues with your networking security group starting January 9, 2023. This situation occurs because we're moving to a new Security Tag labelVideoIndexer. To mitigate the problem, remove the oldAzureVideoAnalyzerForMediatag from your configuration and deployment scripts. Then, use theVideoIndexertag afterward.

To limit access to your resources on a network level, useNetwork Security Groups with Service Tags. A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service, in this case Azure AI Video Indexer. Microsoft manages the address prefixes grouped by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change. This management minimizes the complexity of frequent updates to network security rules by the customer.
Note
The NSG service tags feature isn't available for trial accounts. To update to an Azure Resource Manager account, see theUpdate your Azure AI Video Indexer accountorImport content from a trial account.
Get started with service tags
Currently we support the global service tag option for using service tags in your network security groups:
Use a single global VideoIndexer service tag: This option opens your virtual network to all IP addresses that the Azure AI Video Indexer service uses across all regions we offer our service. This method allows for all IP addresses owned and used by Azure AI Video Indexer to reach your network resources behind the network security group (NSG).
Note
Currently we don't support IPs allocated to our services in the Switzerland North Region. We plan to add support soon. If your account is located in this region, you can't use Service Tags in your NSG today since these IPs aren't in the Service Tag list. They get rejected by the NSG rule.
Use a single global Azure AI Video Indexer service tag
The easiest way to begin using service tags with your Azure AI Video Indexer account is to add the global tagVideoIndexerto an NSG rule.
VideoIndexer
From theAzure portal, select your network security group.
UnderSettings, selectInbound security rules, and then select+ Add.
From theSourcedrop-down list, selectService Tag.
From theSource service tagdrop-down list, selectVideoIndexer.

This tag contains the IP addresses of Azure AI Video Indexer services for all regions where available. The tag ensures that your resource can communicate with the Azure AI Video Indexer services.
Using Azure CLI
You can also use Azure CLI to create a new or update an existing NSG rule and add theVideoIndexerservice tag using the--source-address-prefixes. For a full list of CLI commands and parameters, seeaz network nsg
--source-address-prefixes
Example of a security rule using service tags. For more details, visithttps://aka.ms/servicetags
