Azure Boards offers various processes for managing work items. Selecting the right process helps optimize project workflow and ensure your project's success. In this article, explore the different processes available with Azure Boards. This article provides guidance on how to choose the most suitable process for your project.
When you create a project, you choose aprocessorprocess templatebased on theprocess modelfor which your organization or collection was created. Before you choose a process for your project, you should understand the following terms.
The default process types areBasic,Agile,Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), andScrum. The work tracking objects in the default processes and process templates are the same. They're summarized in this article.
Tip
With Azure DevOps Server, you can choose between using theInherited process modelor theOn-premises XML process model. For more information, seeChoose the process model for your project collection. To access the latest versions of the default processes or process templates:
Inherited process model: Open theProcessespage. For more information, seeManage processes.
Inherited process model: Open theProcessespage. For more information, seeManage processes.
On-premises XML process model:Install or upgrade to the latest version of Azure DevOps Server.Download the zipped template file by using theProcess Template Manager. Use a version of Visual Studio that's at the same version level as Azure DevOps Server. You can install the latest version ofVisual Studio Communityfor free.You can access the latest versions of the default process templates installed on Azure DevOps Server, for example:%programfiles%/Azure DevOps Server 2020/Tools/Deploy/ProcessTemplateManagerFiles/1033. For descriptions of each file and folder, seeOverview of process template files.

Default processes
The default processes differ mainly in the work item types they provide for planning and tracking work. The default processes are:
Basic: Is the most lightweight and is in a selective preview.
Scrum: Is the next most lightweight.
Agile: Supports many Agile method terms.
CMMI: Provides the most support for formal processes and change management.
Note
The Basic process is available withAzure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1and later versions.
Basic
ChooseBasicwhen your team wants the simplest model that uses Issue, Task, and Epic work item types to track work.
Tasks support tracking Remaining Work.

Agile
ChooseAgilewhen your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great for tracking User Stories and, optionally, bugs on the board. You can also track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.
For more information about Agile methodologies, seeAgile Alliance.
Tasks support tracking Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.

Scrum
ChooseScrumwhen your team practices Scrum. This process works great for tracking product backlog items and bugs on the board. You can also break down product backlog items and bugs into tasks on the taskboard.
This process supports the Scrum methodology as defined by theScrum organization.
Tasks support tracking Remaining Work only.

CMMI
ChooseCMMIwhen your team follows more formal project methods that require a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.
This process supportsformal change management activities. Tasks support tracking Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.

If you need more than two or three backlog levels, add more based on the process model that you use:
Inheritance:Customize your backlogs or boards for a process
Hosted XML or On-premises XML:Add portfolio backlogs

Main distinctions among the default processes
The default processes are designed to meet the needs of most teams. If your team has unusual needs and connects to an on-premises server, customize a process and then create the project. You can also create a project from a process and then customize the project.
The following table summarizes the main distinctions between the work item types and states used by the four default processes.

Notes:
Add work items from theproduct backlogorboard. The product backlog shows a single view of the current backlog of work that can be dynamically reordered and grouped. Product owners can prioritize work and outline dependencies and relationships. Each team can configure how they wantbugs to show up on their backlogs and boards.
Define a hierarchy of portfolio backlogs to understand the scope of work across several teams and see how that work rolls up into broader initiatives. Each team configures whichportfolio backlogs appear for their use.
Define tasks from thesprint backlog and taskboard. With capacity planning, teams can determine if they're over capacity or under capacity for a sprint.

Workflow states, transitions, and reasons
Workflow states support tracking the status of work as it moves from aNewstate to aClosedor aDonestate. Each workflow consists of a set of states, the valid transitions between the states, and the reasons for transitioning the work item to the selected state.

Closed
Done
Important
For Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019, the default workflow transitions support any state to any state transition. Customize these workflows to restrict some transitions. For more information, seeCustomize your work tracking experience.
View the supported workflow transitions for each work item type by installing theState Model VisualizationMarketplace extension. This extension adds a new hub underBoardslabeledState Visualizer. On that page, choose a work item type and view the workflow state model.
The following diagrams show the typical forward progression of those work item types used to track work and code defects for the three default processes. They also show some of the regressions to former states and transitions to removed states.
Each image shows only the default reason associated with the transition.

CMMI process





Note
The Basic process is available when you create a new project from Azure DevOps Services orAzure DevOps Server 2019.1. For earlier on-premises deployments, choose the Agile, Scrum, or CMMI process.












Most work item types used by Agile tools, the ones that appear on backlogs and boards, support any-to-any transitions. Update the status of a work item by using the board or the taskboard. Drag a work item to its corresponding state column.
Change the workflow to support other states, transitions, and reasons. For more information, seeCustomize your work tracking experience.

Work item states
When you change the state of a work item toRemoved,Closed, orDone, the system responds as follows:
Removed
Closed
Done
ClosedorDone: Work items in this state don't appear on the portfolio backlog and backlog pages. They do appear on the sprint backlog pages, board, and taskboard. When you change the portfolio backlog view toShow backlog items, for example, to view features to product backlog items, work items in theClosedandDonestate appear.
Closed
Done
Closed
Done
Removed: Work items in this state don't appear on any backlog or board.
Removed
Your project maintains work items as long as the project is active. Even if you set work items toClosed,Done, orRemoved, the data store keeps a record. Use a record to create queries or reports.
Closed
Done
Removed
Note
Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after theirChanged Datevalue is greater than 183 days (about a half a year). You can still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.
Note
Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards after theirChanged Datevalue is greater than a year old. You can still list these items by using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or board, you can make a minor change to them, which resets the clock.
If you need to permanently delete work items, seeRemove or delete work items.

Work item types added to all processes
The following work item types are added to all processes except the Basic process.

Your team can create and work with these types by using the corresponding tool.

Work item types that support the test experience
Work item types that support the test experience and work with Test Manager and the web portal are linked together by using the link types shown in the following image.

From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, view which test cases are defined for a test suite and view which test suites are defined for a test plan. However, these objects aren't connected to each other through link types. Customize these work item types as you would any other work item types. For more information, seeCustomize your work tracking experience.
If you change the workflow for the test plan and test suite, you might need to update the process configuration as described here. For definitions of each test field, seeCreate a query based on build and test integration fields.
