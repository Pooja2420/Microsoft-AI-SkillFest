In this quickstart, you use the simplified Azure DevOps Starter experience to set up a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline for your Java app in Azure Pipelines. You can use Azure DevOps Starter to set up everything you need for developing, deploying, and monitoring your app.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
AnAzure DevOpsaccount and organization.
Sign in to the Azure portal
DevOps Starter creates a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines. You can create a new Azure DevOps organization or use an existing organization. DevOps Starter also creates Azure resources in the Azure subscription of your choice.

DevOps Starter automatically configured a CI build and release trigger.  You're now ready to collaborate with a team on a Java app with a CI/CD process that automatically deploys your latest work to your web site.
Commit code changes and execute CI/CD
DevOps Starter creates a Git repository in Azure Repos or GitHub. To view the repository and make code changes to your application, do the following:
On the left of the DevOps Starter dashboard, select the link for your main branch. This link opens a view to the newly created Git repository.

Examine the CI/CD pipeline
In the previous step, DevOps Starter automatically configured a full CI/CD pipeline. Explore and customize the pipeline as needed. Take the following steps to familiarize yourself with the build and release pipelines.
At the top of the DevOps Starter dashboard, selectBuild Pipelines. This link opens a browser tab and the build pipeline for your new project.

Clean up resources
You can delete Azure App Service and other related resources when you don't need them anymore. Use theDeletefunctionality on the DevOps Starter dashboard.
Next steps
When you configured your CI/CD process, build and release pipelines were automatically created. You can modify these build and release pipelines to meet the needs of your team. To learn more about the CI/CD pipeline, see:
