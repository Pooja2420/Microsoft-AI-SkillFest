Microsoft has a successful and proven approach toZero Trust securityusingDefense in Depthprinciples that use identity as a control plane. Organizations continue to embrace a hybrid workload world for scale, cost savings, and security. Microsoft Entra ID plays a pivotal role in your strategy for identity management. Recently, news surrounding identity and security compromise has increasingly prompted enterprise IT to consider their identity security posture as a measurement of defensive security success.
Increasingly, organizations must embrace a mixture of on-premises and cloud applications, which users access with both onâpremises and cloud-only accounts. Managing users, applications, and devices both on-premises and in the cloud poses challenging scenarios.
Hybrid identity
Microsoft Entra ID creates a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. We call thishybrid identity.
To achieve hybrid identity with Microsoft Entra ID, one of three authentication methods can be used, depending on your scenarios. The three methods are:
Password hash synchronization (PHS)
Pass-through authentication (PTA)
Federation (AD FS)
As you audit your current security operations or establish security operations for your Azure environment, we recommend you:
Read specific portions of the Microsoft security guidance to establish a baseline of knowledge about securing your cloud-based or hybrid Azure environment.
Audit your account and password strategy and authentication methods to help deter the most common attack vectors.
Create a strategy for continuous monitoring and alerting on activities that might indicate a security threat.
Audience
The Microsoft Entra SecOps Guide is intended for enterprise IT identity and security operations teams and managed service providers that need to counter threats through better identity security configuration and monitoring profiles. This guide is especially relevant for IT administrators and identity architects advising Security Operations Center (SOC) defensive and penetration testing teams to improve and maintain their identity security posture.
Scope
This introduction provides the suggested prereading and password audit and strategy recommendations. This article also provides an overview of the tools available for hybrid Azure environments and fully cloud-based Azure environments. Finally, we provide a list of data sources you can use for monitoring and alerting and configuring your security information and event management (SIEM) strategy and environment. The rest of the guidance presents monitoring and alerting strategies in the following areas:
User accounts. Guidance specific to non-privileged user accounts without administrative privilege, including anomalous account creation and usage, and unusual sign-ins.

Data sources
The log files you use for investigation and monitoring are:
Microsoft Entra audit logs
Sign-in logs
Microsoft 365 Audit logs
Azure Key Vault logs
From the Azure portal, you can view the Microsoft Entra audit logs. Download logs as comma separated value (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. The Azure portal has several ways to integrate Microsoft Entra logs with other tools that allow for greater automation of monitoring and alerting:
Microsoft Sentinel- Enables intelligent security analytics at the enterprise level by providing security information and event management (SIEM) capabilities.

Sigma rules- Sigma is an evolving open standard for writing rules and templates that automated management tools can use to parse log files. Where Sigma templates exist for our recommended search criteria, we have added a link to the Sigma repo. The Sigma templates are not written, tested, and managed by Microsoft. Rather, the repo and templates are created and collected by the worldwide IT security community.

Much of what you will monitor and alert on are the effects of your Conditional Access policies. You can use the Conditional Access insights and reporting workbook to examine the effects of one or more Conditional Access policies on your sign-ins and the results of policies, including device state. This workbook enables you to view an impact summary, and identify the impact over a specific time period. You can also use the workbook to investigate the sign-ins of a specific user. For more information, seeConditional Access insights and reporting.
The remainder of this article describes what to monitor and alert on. Where there are specific pre-built solutions we link to them or provide samples following the table. Otherwise, you can build alerts using the preceding tools.
