Azure DevOps Services
Learn how to upload tasks to organization for custom tasks or in-the-box tasks in Azure DevOps using the Node CLI for Azure DevOps (tfx-cli).
For example, this guideline can help to update in-the-box tasks on Azure DevOps Server.
Important
When uploading in-the-box tasks to an on-premises instance, some task capabilities might not be supported due to the old agent version or lack of support on the Azure DevOps Server side.
For more information abouttfx-cli, see theNode CLI for Azure DevOps on GitHub.
Prerequisites
To upload tasks to project collection, you need prerequisites:
Thelatest versionofNode.js.

Tfx-cli sign in with personal access token
Sign in to Azure DevOps with tfx-cli to upload pipeline tasks to the project collection.
Important
A personal access token is required by default for authentication to project collection in Azure DevOps. Createpersonal access token (PAT)with scopeEnvironment (Read & manage).
You can use other ways to authorize with tfx-cli. For more information, seeAuthenticate in Cross-platform CLI for Azure DevOps.
To sign in, specify the path to project collection as URL. The default name of the project collection isDefaultCollection.
DefaultCollection
For Azure DevOps Services, path to project collection would have the following format:https://{Azure DevOps organization name}.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection
https://{Azure DevOps organization name}.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection
For Azure DevOps Server, the default project collection URL depends on the location of the url server and its template:http://{Azure DevOps Server url}/DefaultCollection
http://{Azure DevOps Server url}/DefaultCollection
Enter the following command and provide requested information:
~$ tfx login
~$ tfx login
Uploading tasks to the project collection
Tip
If you need to update in-the-box pipeline tasks, you can cloneazure-pipelines-tasksrepository, and build required tasks followingthe guideline - how to build tasks.
Now you can start to upload task usingtfx-cli.
tfx-cli
Enter the following command:
tfx build tasks upload --task-path <PATH_TO_TASK>
tfx build tasks upload --task-path <PATH_TO_TASK>
Note
PATH_TO_TASK is the path to the folder with the compiled task. For more information about using tfx-cli, seeNode CLI for Azure DevOps documentation.
