Starting May 27, 2025, the Remote Desktop app for Windows from the Microsoft Store will no longer be supported or available for download and installation. Users must transition to Windows App to ensure continued access to Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, and Microsoft Dev Box. For more information, seeGet started with Windows App to connect to devices and apps.
This announcement doesn't apply to the Remote Desktop client for Windows (MSI), but we recommend those users also transition to Windows App for the best experience.
