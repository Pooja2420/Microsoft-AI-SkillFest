This article provides architectural best practices for Azure Monitor Logs. The guidance is based on the five pillars of architecture excellence described inAzure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliabilityrefers to the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. The goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component. Use the following information to minimize failure of your Log Analytics workspaces and to protect the data they collect.
Log Analytics workspaces offer a high degree of reliability. The ingestion pipeline, which sends collected data to the Log Analytics workspace, validates that the Log Analytics workspace successfully processes each log record before it removes the record from the pipe. If the ingestion pipeline isn't available, the agents that send the data buffer and retry sending the logs for many hours.
Azure Monitor Logs features that enhance resilience
Azure Monitor Logs offers several features that enhance workspaces resilience to various types of issues. You can use these features individually or in combination, depending on your needs.
This video provides an overview of reliability and resilience options available for Log Analytics workspaces:
Each Azure region that supports availability zones has a set of datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
Azure Monitor Logs availability zones areredundant, which means that Microsoft spreads service requests and replicates data across different zones in supported regions. If an incident affects one zone, Microsoft uses a different availability zone in the region instead, automatically. You don't need to take any action because switching between zones is seamless.
In most regions, Azure Monitor Logs availability zones supportdata resilience, which means your stored data is protected against data loss related to zonal failures, but service operations might still be impacted by regional incidents. If the service is unable to run queries, you can't view the logs until the issue is resolved.
A subset of the availability zones that support data resilience also supportservice resilience, which means that Azure Monitor Logs service operations - for example, log ingestion, queries, and alerts - can continue in the event of a zone failure.
Availability zones protect against infrastructure-related incidents, such as storage failures. They don't protect against application-level issues, such as faulty code deployments or certificate failures, which impact the entire region.
You cancontinuously export data sent to specific tables in your Log Analytics workspaceto Azure storage accounts.
The storage account you export data to must be in the same region as your Log Analytics workspace. To protect and have access to your ingested logs, even if the workspace region is down, use a geo-redundant storage account, as explained inConfiguration recommendations.
The export mechanism doesn't provide protection from incidents impacting the ingestion pipeline or the export process itself.
Note
You can access data in a storage account from Azure Monitor Logs using theexternaldata operator. However, the exported data is stored in five-minute blobs and analyzing data spanning multiple blobs can be cumbersome. Therefore, exporting data to a storage account is a good data backup mechanism, but having the backed up data in a storage account is not ideal if you need it for analysis in Azure Monitor Logs. You can query large volumes of blob data usingAzure Data Explorer,Azure Data Factory, or any other storage access tool.
Workspace replication is the most extensive resilience solution as it replicates the Log Analytics workspace and incoming logs to another region.
Workspace replication protects both your logs and the service operations, and allows you to continue monitoring your systems in the event of infrastructure or application-related region-wide incidents.
In contrast with availability zones, which Microsoft manages end-to-end, you need to monitor your primary workspace's health and decide when to switch over to the workspace in the secondary region and back.
Design checklist
To ensure service and data resilience to region-wide incidents, enable workspace replication.
To ensure in-region protection against datacenter failure, create your workspace in a region that supports availability zones.
For cross-regional backup of data in specific tables, use the continuous export feature to send data to a geo-replicated storage account.
Monitor the health of your Log Analytics workspaces.
Configuration recommendations
1Data export provides cross-region protection if you export logs to a geo-replicated storage account. In the event of an incident, previously exported data is backed up and readily available; however, further export might fail, depending on the nature of the incident.
Security
Securityis one of the most important aspects of any architecture. Azure Monitor provides features to employ both the principle of least privilege and defense-in-depth. Use the following information to maximize the security of your Log Analytics workspaces and ensure that only authorized users access collected data.
Set the workspace access control mode toUse resource or workspace permissionsto allow resource owners to useresource-contextto access their data without being granted explicit access to the workspace. This simplifies your workspace configuration and helps to ensure users only have access to the data they need.Instructions:Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces
Assign the appropriate built-in role to grant workspace permissions to administrators at the subscription, resource group, or workspace level depending on their scope of responsibilities.Instructions:Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces
Apply table-level RBAC for users who require access to a set of tables across multiple resources. Users with table permissions have access to all the data in the table regardless of their resource permissions.Instructions:Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces
If you use agents, connectors, or the Logs ingestion API to send data to your workspace, use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher to ensure the security of your data in transit.  Older versions of TLS/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) have been found to be vulnerable and, while they still currently work to allow backwards compatibility, they arenot recommended, and the industry is quickly moving to abandon support for these older protocols.
ThePCI Security Standards Councilhas set adeadline of June 30, 2018to disable older versions of TLS/SSL and upgrade to more secure protocols. Once Azure drops legacy support, if your agents can't communicate over at least TLS 1.3, you won't be able to send data to Azure Monitor Logs.
We recommend that you do NOT explicitly set your agent to only use TLS 1.3 unless necessary. Allowing the agent to automatically detect, negotiate, and take advantage of future security standards is preferable. Otherwise, you might miss the added security of the newer standards and possibly experience problems if TLS 1.3 is ever deprecated in favor of those newer standards.
Important
On 1 July 2025, in alignment with theAzure wide legacy TLS retirement, TLS 1.0/1.1 protocol versions will be retired for Azure Monitor Logs. To provide best-in-class encryption, Azure Monitor Logs uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 and 1.3 as the encryption mechanisms of choice.
For any general questions around the legacy TLS problem, seeSolving TLS problemsandAzure Resource Manager TLS Support.
Configure log query auditing to record the details of each query that's run in a workspace.Instructions:Audit queries in Azure Monitor Logs
Treat the log query audit data as security data and secure access to theLAQueryLogstable appropriately.Instructions:Configure access to data in the workspace based on need.
If you separate your operational and security data, send the audit logs for each workspace to the local workspace, or consolidate in a dedicated security workspace.Instructions:Configure access to data in the workspace based on need.
Use Log Analytics workspace insights to review log query audit data periodically.Instructions:Log Analytics workspace insights.
Create log search alert rules to notify you if unauthorized users are attempting to run queries.Instructions:Log search alert rules.
Azure Monitor is an append-only data platform, but it includes provisions to delete data for compliance purposes. To secure your audit data:
Set a lock on your Log Analytics workspace to block all activities that could delete data, including purge, table delete, and table- or workspace-level data retention changes. However, keep in mind that this lock can be removed.Instructions:Lock your resources to protect your infrastructure

Azure Monitor encrypts all data at rest and saved queries using Microsoft-managed keys (MMK). If you collect enough data for adedicated cluster, link your workspace to a dedicated cluster for enhanced security features, including:
Customer-managed keysfor greater flexibility and key lifecycle control. If you use Microsoft Sentinel, then make sure that you're familiar with the considerations atSet up Microsoft Sentinel customer-managed key.
Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azureto review and approve or reject customer data access requests. Customer Lockbox is used when a Microsoft engineer needs to access customer data, whether in response to a customer-initiated support ticket or a problem identified by Microsoft. Lockbox can't currently be applied to tables with theAuxiliary plan.
Instructions:Create and manage a dedicated cluster in Azure Monitor Logs
Microsoft secures connections to public endpoints with end-to-end encryption. If you require a private endpoint, useAzure private linkto allow resources to connect to your Log Analytics workspace through authorized private networks. You can also use Private link to force workspace data ingestion through ExpressRoute or a VPN.
Instructions:Design your Azure Private Link setup
Cost optimization
Cost optimizationrefers to ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. You can significantly reduce your cost for Azure Monitor by understanding your different configuration options and opportunities to reduce the amount of data that it collects. SeeAzure Monitor cost and usageto understand the different ways that Azure Monitor charges and how to view your monthly bill.
Note
SeeOptimize costs in Azure Monitorfor cost optimization recommendations across all features of Azure Monitor.
Design checklist
Determine whether to combine your operational data and your security data in the same Log Analytics workspace.
Configure pricing tier for the amount of data that each Log Analytics workspace typically collects.
Configure data retention and archiving.
Configure tables used for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing as Basic Logs.
Limit data collection from data sources for the workspace.
Regularly analyze collected data to identify trends and anomalies.
Create an alert when data collection is high.
Consider a daily cap as a preventative measure to ensure that you don't exceed a particular budget.
Set up alerts on Azure Advisor cost recommendations for Log Analytics workspaces.
Configuration recommendations
Consider configuring the cost effective Basic logs plan on selected tables - We've identified ingestion of more than 1 GB per month to tables that are eligible for the low cost Basic log data plan. The Basic log plan gives you query capabilities for debugging and troubleshooting at a lower cost.
Consider changing pricing tier- Based on your current usage volume, investigate changing your pricing (Commitment) tier to receive a discount and reduce costs.
Consider removing unused restored tables - You have one or more tables with restored data active in your workspace. If you're no longer using a restored data, delete the table to avoid unnecessary charges.
Data ingestion anomaly was detected - We've identified a much higher ingestion rate over the past week, based on your ingestion in the three previous weeks. Take note of this change and the expected change in your costs.
Operational excellence
