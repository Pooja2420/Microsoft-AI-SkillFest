This quickstart describes how to enable backup on an existing Azure VM by using the Azure portal. If you need to create a VM, you cancreate a VM with the Azure portal.
Azure backups can be created through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface to create and configure Azure backups and all related resources. You can protect your data by taking backups at regular intervals. Azure Backup creates recovery points that can be stored in geo-redundant recovery vaults. This article details how to back up a virtual machine (VM) with the Azure portal.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Note
The functionality described in the following sections can also be accessed viaBackup center. Backup center is a single unified management experience in Azure. It enables enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale. With this solution, you can perform most of the key backup management operations without being limited to the scope of an individual vault.
Create a Recovery Services vault
A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points that are created over time, and it provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies.
To create a Recovery Services vault:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forBusiness Continuity Center, and then go to theBusiness Continuity Centerdashboard.

On theRecovery Services vaultpane, enter the following values:Subscription: Select the subscription to use. If you're a member of only one subscription, you'll see that name. If you're not sure which subscription to use, use the default subscription. There are multiple choices only if your work or school account is associated with more than one Azure subscription.Resource group: Use an existing resource group or create a new one. To view a list of available resource groups in your subscription, selectUse existing, and then select a resource in the dropdown list. To create a new resource group, selectCreate new, and then enter the name. For more information about resource groups, seeAzure Resource Manager overview.Vault name: Enter a friendly name to identify the vault. The name must be unique to the Azure subscription. Specify a name that has at least 2 but not more than 50 characters. The name must start with a letter and consist only of letters, numbers, and hyphens.Region: Select the geographic region for the vault. For you to create a vault to help protect any data source, the vaultmustbe in the same region as the data source.ImportantIf you're not sure of the location of your data source, close the window. Go to the list of your resources in the portal. If you have data sources in multiple regions, create a Recovery Services vault for each region. Create the vault in the first location before you create a vault in another location. There's no need to specify storage accounts to store the backup data. The Recovery Services vault and Azure Backup handle that automatically.

Note
Azure Backup now supports immutable vaults that help you ensure that recovery points once created can't be deleted before their expiry as per the backup policy. You can make the immutability irreversible for maximum protection to your backup data from various threats, including ransomware attacks and malicious actors.Learn more.
Important
If you haveAzure Files for protection, after vault creation,configure backup for Azure Files, and then initiate an on-demand backup. Learn moreabout the best practices for Azure Files backup.

Go toBackup centerand select+Backupfrom theOverviewtab.

If you need to re-protect the VM, then you need to wait for the soft delete period to expire or undelete the VM from the soft deleted list. For more information, seethe soft delete for VMs article.

Enable backup on a VM
A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected resource, such as Azure VMs. When the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a recovery point inside the Recovery Services vault. You can then use one of these recovery points to restore data to a given point in time.
To enable VM backup, inBackup, selectEnable backup. This deploys the policy to the vault and to the VMs, and installs the backup extension on the VM agent running on the Azure VM.
After enabling backup:
The Backup service installs the backup extension whether or not the VM is running.
An initial backup will run in accordance with your backup schedule.
When backups run, note that:A VM that's running has the greatest chance for capturing an application-consistent recovery point.However, even if the VM is turned off, it's backed up. Such a VM is known as an offline VM. In this case, the recovery point will be crash-consistent.

Explicit outbound connectivity isn't required to allow backup of Azure VMs.
Create a custom policy
If you selected to create a new backup policy, fill in the policy settings.
InPolicy name, specify a meaningful name.

InBackup schedule, specify when backups should be taken. You can take daily or weekly backups for Azure VMs.

InInstant Restore, specify how long you want to retain snapshots locally for instant restore.When you restore, backed up VM disks are copied from storage, across the network to the recovery storage location. With instant restore, you can leverage locally stored snapshots taken during a backup job, without waiting for backup data to be transferred to the vault.You can retain snapshots for instant restore for between one to five days. The default value is two days.

Note
Azure Backup doesn't support automatic clock adjustment for daylight-saving changes for Azure VM backups. As time changes occur, modify backup policies manually as required.
Start a backup job
The initial backup will run in accordance with the schedule, but you can run it immediately as follows:
Go toBackup centerand select theBackup Instancesmenu item.
SelectAzure Virtual machinesas theDatasource type. Then search for the VM that you have configured for backup.
Right-click the relevant row or select the more icon (â¦), and then selectBackup Now.
InBackup Now, use the calendar control to select the last day that the recovery point should be retained. Then selectOK.
Monitor the portal notifications.
To  monitor the job progress, go toBackup center>Backup Jobsand filter the list forIn progressjobs.
Depending on the size of your VM, creating the initial backup may take a while.
Monitor the backup job
The Backup job details for each VM backup consist of two phases, theSnapshotphase followed by theTransfer data to vaultphase.
The snapshot phase guarantees the availability of a recovery point stored along with the disks forInstant Restoresand are available for a maximum of five days depending on the snapshot retention configured by the user. Transfer data to vault creates a recovery point in the vault for long-term retention. Transfer data to vault only starts after the snapshot phase is completed.

There are twoSub Tasksrunning at the backend, one for front-end backup job that can be checked from theBackup Jobdetails blade as given below:

TheTransfer data to vaultphase can take multiple days to complete depending on the size of the disks, churn per disk and several other factors.
Job status can vary depending on the following scenarios:
Now with this capability, for the same VM, two backups can run in parallel, but in either phase (snapshot, transfer data to vault) only one sub task can be running. So in scenarios where a backup job in progress resulted in the next dayâs backup to fail, it will be avoided with this decoupling functionality. Subsequent days' backups can have the snapshot completed, whileTransfer data to vaultis skipped if an earlier dayâs backup job is in progress state.
The incremental recovery point created in the vault will capture all the churn from the most recent recovery point created in the vault. There's no cost impact on the user.
Optional steps
Install the VM agent
Azure Backup backs up Azure VMs by installing an extension to the Azure VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure Marketplace image, the agent is installed and running. If you create a custom VM, or you migrate an on-premises machine, you might need to install the agent manually, as summarized in the table.
Clean up deployment
When no longer needed, you can disable protection on the VM, remove the restore points and Recovery Services vault, then delete the resource group and associated VM resources
