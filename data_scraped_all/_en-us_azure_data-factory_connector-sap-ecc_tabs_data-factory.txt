This article outlines how to use the copy activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from SAP Enterprise Central Component (ECC). For more information, seeCopy activity overview.
Tip
To learn the overall support on SAP data integration scenario, seeSAP data integration using Azure Data Factory whitepaperwith detailed introduction on each SAP connector, comparison and guidance.
Supported capabilities
This SAP ECC connector is supported for the following capabilities:
â  Azure integration runtime â¡ Self-hosted integration runtime
For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks, see theSupported data storestable.
Specifically, this SAP ECC connector supports:
Copying data from SAP ECC on SAP NetWeaver version 7.0 and later.
Copying data from SAP ECC on SAP NetWeaver version 7.0 and later.
Copying data from any objects exposed by SAP ECC OData services, such as:SAP tables or views.Business Application Programming Interface [BAPI] objects.Data extractors.Data or intermediate documents (IDOCs) sent to SAP Process Integration (PI) that can be received as OData via relative adapters.

The version 7.0 or later refers to SAP NetWeaver version instead of SAP ECC version. For example,â¯SAP ECC 6.0 EHP 7 in general has NetWeaver version >=7.4. In case you are unsure about your environment, here are the steps to confirm the version from your SAP system:
Use SAP GUI to connect to the SAP System.
Go toSystem->Status.
Check the release of the SAP_BASIS, ensure it is equal to or larger than 701.
Tip
To copy data from SAP ECC via an SAP table or view, use theSAP tableconnector, which is faster and more scalable.
Prerequisites
To use this SAP ECC connector, you need to expose the SAP ECC entities via OData services through SAP Gateway. More specifically:
Set up SAP Gateway. For servers with SAP NetWeaver versions later than 7.4, SAP Gateway is already installed. For earlier versions, you must install the embedded SAP Gateway or the SAP Gateway hub system before exposing SAP ECC data through OData services. To set up SAP Gateway, see theinstallation guide.

For earlier versions, you must install the embedded SAP Gateway or the SAP Gateway hub system before exposing SAP ECC data through OData services. To set up SAP Gateway, see theinstallation guide.
Activate and configure the SAP OData service. You can activate the OData service through TCODE SICF in seconds. You can also configure which objects need to be exposed. For more information, see thestep-by-step guidance.

If your data store is located inside an on-premises network, an Azure virtual network, or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, you need to configure aself-hosted integration runtimeto connect to it.
If your data store is a managed cloud data service, you can use the Azure Integration Runtime. If the access is restricted to IPs that are approved in the firewall rules, you can addAzure Integration Runtime IPsto the allow list.
You can also use themanaged virtual network integration runtimefeature in Azure Data Factory to access the on-premises network without installing and configuring a self-hosted integration runtime.
For more information about the network security mechanisms and options supported by Data Factory, seeData access strategies.
