This article explains the concept of Azure Log Analytics workspace soft-delete and how to recover a deleted workspace in a soft-delete state. It also explains how to delete a workspace permanently instead of deleting it into a soft-delete state.
Permissions required
To delete a Log Analytics workspace into a soft-delete state or permanently, you needmicrosoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/deletepermissions to the workspace, as provided by theLog Analytics Contributor built-in role, for example.
microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/delete
To recover a Log Analytics workspace in a soft-delete state, you needMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/writepermissions to the workspace, as provided by theLog Analytics Contributor built-in role, for example.
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write
Considerations when you delete a workspace
When you delete a Log Analytics workspace into a soft-delete state, a soft-delete operation is performed to allow the recovery of the workspace, including its data and connected agents, within 14 days. This process occurs whether the deletion was accidental or intentional.
After the soft-delete period, the workspace resource and its data are non-recoverable and queued for purge completely within 30 days. The workspace name is released and you can use it to create a new workspace.
Note
If you want to override the soft-delete behavior and permanently delete your workspace, follow the steps inDelete a workspace permanently, but use it with caution since non-recoverable.
The soft-delete operation deletes the workspace resource, and any associated users' permission is broken. If users are associated with other workspaces, they can continue using Log Analytics with those other workspaces.
Be careful when you delete a workspace because there might be important data and configuration that might negatively affect your service operation. Review what agents, solutions, and other Azure services store their data in Log Analytics, such as:
Management solutions.
Azure Automation.
Agents running on Windows and Linux virtual machines.
Agents running on Windows and Linux computers in your environment.
System Center Operations Manager.
Delete a workspace into a soft-delete state
The workspace delete operation removes the workspace Azure Resource Manager resource. Its configuration and data are kept for 14 days, although it will look as if the workspace is deleted. Any agents and System Center Operations Manager management groups configured to report to the workspace remain in an orphaned state during the soft-delete period. The service provides a mechanism forrecovering the deleted workspace, including its data and connected resources, essentially undoing the deletion.
Note
Installed solutions and linked services like your Azure Automation account are permanently removed from the workspace at deletion time and can't be recovered. These resources should be reconfigured after the recovery operation to bring the workspace back to its previously configured state. Data related to these solutions remains in workspace for the soft-delete period and can be recovered.

To delete a workspace into a soft-delete state, call theWorkspaces - Delete API:
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}?api-version=2022-10-01
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}?api-version=2022-10-01
To delete a workspace into a soft-delete state, run theRemove-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspacecmdlet.
PS C:\>Remove-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -Name "workspace-name"
PS C:\>Remove-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -Name "workspace-name"
To delete a workspace into a soft-delete state, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace deletecommand.
az monitor log-analytics workspace delete --resource-group MyResourceGroup --workspace-name MyWorkspace
az monitor log-analytics workspace delete --resource-group MyResourceGroup --workspace-name MyWorkspace
Recover a workspace in a soft-delete state
When you delete a Log Analytics workspace accidentally or intentionally, the service places the workspace in a soft-delete state and makes it inaccessible. The name of the deleted workspace is preserved during the soft-delete period and can't be used to create a new workspace. After the soft-delete period, the workspace is non-recoverable, data is permanently purged, and name can be used in new workspace.
You can recover your workspace during the soft-delete period, including its data, configuration, and connected agents. The workspace recovery is performed by re-creating the Log Analytics workspace with the details of the deleted workspace, including:
Subscription ID
Resource group name
Workspace name
Region
Important
If your workspace was deleted as part of a resource group delete operation, you must first re-create the resource group.
The workspace and all its data are brought back after the recovery operation. However, solutions and linked services were permanently removed from the workspace when it was deleted into a soft-delete state. These resources should be reconfigured to bring the workspace to its previously configured state. After you recover the workspace, some of the data might not be available for query until the associated solutions are reinstalled and their schemas are added to the workspace.

To recover the workspace, create it again with the same name, in the same subscription, resource group and location by calling theWorkspaces - Create Or Update API.

Delete a workspace permanently
The soft-delete method might not fit in some scenarios, such as development and testing, where you need to repeat deployment with the same settings and workspace name. In such cases, you can permanently delete your workspace and "override" the soft-delete wait period by selecting 'Delete workspace permanently' in Azure portal, or usingforceparameter in programmatic calls. The permanent workspace delete operation releases the workspace name, and you can create a new workspace with the same name.

Important
Permanent workspace delete should be done with caution since non-recoverable.
If the workspace is in soft-delete state, you mustrecover the workspacefirst and permanently delete it then.

Troubleshooting
Use the following section to troubleshoot issues with deleting or recovering a Log Analytics workspace.
I'm not sure if the workspace I deleted can be recovered
If you aren't sure if a deleted workspace is in a soft-delete state and can be recovered, in the Azure portal, selectOpen recycle binon theLog Analytics workspacespage to see a list of soft-deleted workspaces per subscription. Permanently deleted workspaces aren't included in the list.
Resolve the "This workspace name is already in use" or "conflict" error message
If you receive one of these error messages when you create a workspace, it could be because:
The workspace name isn't available because it's being used by someone in your organization or another customer.
The workspace name isn't available because it's being used by someone in your organization or another customer.
The workspace was deleted in the last 14 days and its name was kept reserved for the soft-delete period. To resolve, follow these steps:Recoveryour workspace in a soft-delete state, which allows you to delete it permanently.Permanently deletethe workspace you recovered. When you delete a workspace permanently, its name is no longer reserved.Create a new workspaceby using the same workspace name.After the deletion call is successfully completed on the back end, you can restore the workspace and finish the permanent delete operation by using one of the methods suggested earlier.

I'm receiving 204 response code with "Resource not found" when deleting a workspace
If you get a 204 response code with "Resource not found" when you delete a workspace, consecutive retries operations might have occurred. The 204 code is an empty response, which usually means that the resource doesn't exist, so the delete finished without doing anything.
I'm receiving error code 404 when attempting to recover my workspace
If you deleted your resource group and your workspace was included, you can see the deleted workspace on theOpen recycle binpage in the Azure portal. The recovery operation will fail with the error code 404 because the resource group doesn't exist.Re-create your resource groupand try the recovery again.
