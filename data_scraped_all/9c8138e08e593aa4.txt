Important
We recommend that you use thenew migration service in Azure Database for PostgreSQLfor a more streamlined and efficient migration experience. This service simplifies the process by supporting a variety of source environments, ensuring a hassle-free transition to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
For more information about Azure Database Migration Service, see the articleWhat is Azure Database Migration Service?
You can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the databases from an on-premises PostgreSQL instance toAzure Database for PostgreSQLwith minimal downtime to the application. In this tutorial, you migrate thelistdbsample database from an on-premises instance of PostgreSQL 13.10 to Azure Database for PostgreSQL by using the online migration activity in Azure Database Migration Service.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Migrate the sample schema using the pg_dump utility.
Create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service.
Create a migration project in Azure Database Migration Service.
Run the migration.
Monitor the migration.
Perform migration cutover.
Using Azure Database Migration Service to perform an online migration requires creating an instance based on the Premium pricing tier. We encrypt disk to prevent data theft during the process of migration
Important
For an optimal migration experience, Microsoft recommends creating an instance of Azure Database Migration Service in the same Azure region as the target database. Moving data across regions or geographies can slow down the migration process and introduce errors.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need to:
Download and installPostgreSQL community edition. The source PostgreSQL Server version must be >= 9.4. For more information, seeSupported PostgreSQL versions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.Also note that the target Azure Database for PostgreSQL version must be equal to or later than the on-premises PostgreSQL version. For example, PostgreSQL 12 can migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL >= 12 version but not to Azure Database for PostgreSQL 11.

Create a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network for Azure Database Migration Service by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises source servers by using eitherExpressRouteorVPN. For more information about creating a virtual network, see theVirtual Network Documentation, and especially the quickstart articles with step-by-step details.During virtual network setup, if you use ExpressRoute with network peering to Microsoft, add the following serviceendpointsto the subnet in which the service will be provisioned:Target database endpoint (for example, SQL endpoint, Azure Cosmos DB endpoint, and so on)Storage endpointService bus endpointThis configuration is necessary because Azure Database Migration Service lacks internet connectivity.

Ensure that the Network Security Group (NSG) rules for your virtual network don't block the outbound port 443 of ServiceTag for ServiceBus, Storage and AzureMonitor. For more detail on virtual network NSG traffic filtering, see the articleFilter network traffic with network security groups.

When using a firewall appliance in front of your source database(s), you might need to add firewall rules to allow the Azure Database Migration Service to access the source database(s) for migration.

Important
All tables in your existing database need a primary key to ensure that changes can be synced to the target database.
Migrate the sample schema
To complete all the database objects like table schemas, indexes and stored procedures, we need to extract schema from the source database and apply to the database.
Use pg_dump -s command to create a schema dump file for a database.pg_dump -O -h hostname -U db_username -d db_name -s > your_schema.sqlFor example, to create a schema dump file for thelistdbdatabase:pg_dump -O -h localhost -U postgres -d listdb -s -x > listdbSchema.sqlFor more information about using the pg_dump utility, see the examples in thepg-dumptutorial.
Use pg_dump -s command to create a schema dump file for a database.
pg_dump -O -h hostname -U db_username -d db_name -s > your_schema.sql
pg_dump -O -h hostname -U db_username -d db_name -s > your_schema.sql
For example, to create a schema dump file for thelistdbdatabase:
pg_dump -O -h localhost -U postgres -d listdb -s -x > listdbSchema.sql
pg_dump -O -h localhost -U postgres -d listdb -s -x > listdbSchema.sql
For more information about using the pg_dump utility, see the examples in thepg-dumptutorial.
Create an empty database in your target environment, which is Azure Database for PostgreSQL.For details on how to connect and create a database, see the articleCreate an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server in the Azure portal.

For details on how to connect and create a database, see the articleCreate an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server in the Azure portal.
Import the schema into the target database you created by restoring the schema dump file.psql -h hostname -U db_username -d db_name < your_schema.sqlFor example:psql -h mypgserver-20170401.postgres.database.azure.com  -U postgres -d migratedb < listdbSchema.sqlNoteThe migration service internally handles the enable/disable of foreign keys and triggers to ensure a reliable and robust data migration. As a result, you don't have to worry about making any modifications to the target database schema.
Import the schema into the target database you created by restoring the schema dump file.
psql -h hostname -U db_username -d db_name < your_schema.sql
psql -h hostname -U db_username -d db_name < your_schema.sql
For example:
psql -h mypgserver-20170401.postgres.database.azure.com  -U postgres -d migratedb < listdbSchema.sql
psql -h mypgserver-20170401.postgres.database.azure.com  -U postgres -d migratedb < listdbSchema.sql
