When you use Azure NetApp Files storage with cool access, you can configure inactive data to move from Azure NetApp Files storage (thehot tier) to an Azure storage account (thecool tier). Enabling cool access moves inactive data blocks from the volume and the volume's snapshots to the cool tier, which results in cost savings.
Most cold data is associated with unstructured data. It can account for more than 50% of the total storage capacity in many storage environments. Infrequently accessed data associated with productivity software, completed projects, and old datasets are an inefficient use of high-performance storage.
Azure NetApp Files supports cool access with threeservice levels: Standard, Premium, and Ultra.
The following diagram illustrates an application with a volume enabled for cool access.

In the initial write, data blocks are assigned a "warm" temperature value (in the diagram, red data blocks) and exist on the "hot" tier. Because the data resides on the volume, a temperature scan monitors the activity of each block. When a data block is inactive, the temperature scan decreases the value of the block until inactivity reaches the number of days specified in the coolness period. The coolness period can be set between 2 and 183 days. The default value is 31 days.
After data blocks are marked "cold," the tiering scan collects the blocks and packages them into 4-MB objects. Their move to Azure storage is transparent. To the application and users, the cool blocks still appear online. Tiered data appears to be online and continues to be available to users and applications by transparent and automated retrieval from the cool tier.
Note
When you enable cool access, data that satisfies the conditions set by the coolness period moves to the cool tier. For example, if the coolness period is set to 30 days, any data that was cool for at least 30 days moves to the cool tierwhenyou enable cool access. Once the coolness period is reached, background jobs can take up to 48 hours to initiate the data transfer to the cool tier.
By default (unless cool access retrieval policy is configured otherwise), data blocks on the cool tier that are read randomly again become "warm" and are moved back to the hot tier. After the data blocks are marked as "warm," they're again subjected to the temperature scan. Large sequential reads (like index and antivirus scans) on inactive data in the cool tier don't "warm" the data. They also don't trigger inactive data so that it moves back to the hot tier.
Metadata is never cooled and always remains in the hot tier. Tiering doesn't affect the activities of metadata-intensive workloads like high file-count environments like chip design, version control systems, and home directories.

Billing
You can enable tiering at the volume level for a newly created capacity pool. How you're billed is based on:
The capacity and the service level.
Unallocated capacity within the capacity pool.
The capacity in the cool tier.
Network transfer between the hot tier and the cool tier. The markup on top of the transaction cost (GETandPUTrequests) on blob storage and private link transfer in either direction between the hot tiers determines the rate.
GET
PUT
Billing calculation for a capacity pool is at the hot-tier rate for the data that isn't tiered to the cool tier. Unallocated capacity within the capacity pool is included. When you enable tiering for volumes, the capacity in the cool tier is at the rate of the cool tier. The remaining capacity is at the rate of the hot tier. The rate of the cool tier is lower than the hot tier's rate.
Examples of billing structure
Assume that you created a 4-TiB Standard capacity pool. The billing structure is at the Standard capacity tier rate for the entire 4 TiB.
When you create volumes in the capacity pool and start tiering data to the cool tier, the following scenarios explain the billing structure that applies:
Assume that you create three volumes with 1 TiB each. You don't enable tiering at the volume level. The billing calculation is:3 TiB of allocated capacity at the hot tier rate.1 TiB of unallocated capacity at the hot tier rate.Zero capacity at the cool tier rate.Zero network transfer between the hot tier and the cool tier. The markup on top of the transaction cost (GET,PUT) on blob storage and private link transfer in either direction between the hot tiers determines the rate.
Assume that you create three volumes with 1 TiB each. You don't enable tiering at the volume level. The billing calculation is:
3 TiB of allocated capacity at the hot tier rate.
1 TiB of unallocated capacity at the hot tier rate.
Zero capacity at the cool tier rate.
Zero network transfer between the hot tier and the cool tier. The markup on top of the transaction cost (GET,PUT) on blob storage and private link transfer in either direction between the hot tiers determines the rate.

Assume that you create four volumes with 1 TiB each. Each volume has 0.25 TiB of the volume capacity on the hot tier and 0.75 TiB of the volume capacity in the cool tier. The billing calculation is:1-TiB capacity at the hot tier rate.3-TiB capacity at the cool tier rate.Network transfer between the hot tier and the cool tier. The markup on top of the transaction cost (GET,PUT) on blob storage and private link transfer in either direction between the hot tiers determines the rate.

Azure NetApp Files storage with cool access also enables you to only tier snapshots. For this scenario, assume you create one 1-TiB volume where 10% of the volume data is snapshots and enable cool access with the-snapshots-onlypolicy. The billing calculation is:0.9-TiB capacity at the hot tier0.1-TiB capacity at the cool tierData transfers costs occur for the initial transfer of snapshots, then network transfer costs incur only when snapshots are restored.

Data transfers costs occur for the initial transfer of snapshots, then network transfer costs incur only when snapshots are restored.
Examples of cost calculations with varying coolness periods
This section shows you examples of storage and network transfer costs with varying coolness periods.
In these examples, assume that:
The hot tier storage cost is $0.000202/GiB/hr. The cool tier storage cost is $0.000082/GiB/hr.
Network transfer cost (including read or write activities from the cool tier) is $0.020000/GiB.
A 5-TiB capacity pool with cool access is enabled.
One TiB of unallocated capacity is within the capacity pool.
A 4-TiB volume is enabled for cool access.
After the coolness period, 3 TiB of the 4 TiB is moved to the cool tier.
Each month, you read or write 20% of data from the cool tier.
Each month is 30 days or 730 hours. So each day is 730/30 hours.
Important
Use these calculations only as a reference estimate and not for validating the exact bill amount.
The rates considered in the examples are for an example region and might be different for your intended region of deployment.
If data is read from or written to the cool tier, it causes the percentage of data distribution in the hot tier and cool tier to change. The calculations in this article demonstrate initial percentage distribution in the hot and cool tiers, and not after the 20% of data was moved to or from the cool tier.
The following examples include 1 TiB of unallocated space in the capacity pool to show how unallocated space is charged when cool access is enabled. To maximize your savings, the capacity pool size should be reduced to eliminate unallocated pool capacity.
