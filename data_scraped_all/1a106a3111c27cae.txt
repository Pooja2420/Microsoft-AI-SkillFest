This article describes how to restore Azure VM data from the recovery points stored inAzure BackupRecovery Services vaults.
Restore options
Azure Backup provides several ways to restore a VM.
Tip
To receive alerts/notifications when a restore operation fails, useAzure Monitor alerts for Azure Backup. This helps you to monitor such failures and take necessary actions to remediate the issues.
Note
You can also recover specific files and folders on an Azure VM.Learn more.
Storage accounts
Some details about storage accounts:
Create VM: When you create a new VM with managed disks, nothing is placed in the storage account you specify. If using unmanaged disks, the VHD files for the VM's disks will be placed in the storage account you specify.
Restore disk: The VM restore job generates a template, which you can download and use to specify custom VM settings. VHD files are also copied when restoring managed disks< 4 TBor VMs containing< 16 disksfrom a Vault-Standard recovery point, or when restoring unmanaged disks. These files are then moved to Managed storage. To prevent extra charges, delete VHDs from the Staging Storage Account.
Replace disk: When replacing a managed disk from a Vault-Standard recovery point that's< 4 TBor a VM containing< 16 disks, a VHD file is created in the specified storage account. After replacement, source VM disks remain in the designated Resource Group, and VHDs stay in the storage account; you can delete or retain the source disk and the VHDs as needed.
Storage account location: The storage account must be in the same region as the vault. Only these accounts are displayed. If there are no storage accounts in the location, you need to create one.
Storage type: Blob storage isn't supported.
Premium storage:When you restore non-premium VMs, premium storage accounts aren't supported.When you restore managed VMs, premium storage accounts configured with network rules aren't supported.
When you restore non-premium VMs, premium storage accounts aren't supported.
When you restore managed VMs, premium storage accounts configured with network rules aren't supported.
Before you start
To restore a VM (create a new VM), make sure you have the correct Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)permissionsfor the Restore VM operation.
If you don't have permissions, you canrestore a disk, and then after the disk is restored, you canuse the templatethat was generated as part of the restore operation to create a new VM.
Note
The functionality described in the following sections can also be accessed viaBackup center. Backup center is a single unified management experience in Azure. It enables enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale. With this solution, you can perform most of the key backup management operations without being limited to the scope of an individual vault.

Restore disks
As one of therestore options, you can create a disk from a restore point. Then with the disk, you can do one of the following actions:
Use the template that's generated during the restore operation to customize settings, and trigger VM deployment. You edit the default template settings, and submit the template for VM deployment.

When your virtual machine uses managed disks and you select theCreate virtual machineoption, Azure Backup doesn't use the specified storage account. In the case ofRestore disksandInstant Restore, the storage account is used only for storing the template. Managed disks are created in the specified resource group. When your virtual machine uses unmanaged disks, they're restored as blobs to the storage account.
While you restore disks for a Managed VM from a Vault-Standard recovery point, it restores the Managed disk and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, along with the VHD files of the disks in staging location. If you restore disks from an Instant recovery point, it restores the Managed disks and ARM templates only.
Note
For restoring disk from a Vault-Standard recovery point that is/was greater than 4 TB, Azure Backup doesn't restore the VHD files.
For information on managed/premium disk performance after restored via Azure Backup, see theLatencysection.
Use templates to customize a restored VM
After the disk is restored, use the template that was generated as part of the restore operation to customize and create a new VM:
InBackup Jobs, select the relevant restore job.
InBackup Jobs, select the relevant restore job.
InRestore, selectDeploy Templateto initiate template deployment.NoteFor a shared access signature (SAS) that hasAllow storage account key accessset to disabled, the template won't deploy when you selectDeploy Template.
InRestore, selectDeploy Templateto initiate template deployment.

Note
For a shared access signature (SAS) that hasAllow storage account key accessset to disabled, the template won't deploy when you selectDeploy Template.
To customize the VM setting provided in the template, selectEdit template. If you want to add more customizations, selectEdit parameters.Learn moreabout deploying resources from a custom template.Learn moreabout authoring templates.

Assign network access settings during restore
Azure Backup also allows you to configure the access options for the restored disks once the restore operation is complete. You can set the disk access preferences at the time of initiating the restore.
Note
This feature is generally available for backed-up VMs that use private endpoint-enabled disks.
To enable disk access on restored disks duringVM restore, choose one of the following options:
Use the same network configurations as the source disk(s): This option allows the restored disks to use the disk access and network configurations same as that of the source disks.
Enable public access from all networks: This option allows the restored disk to be publicly accessible from all networks.
Disable public access and enable private access (using disk access): This option allows you to disable the public access and assign disk access to the restored disks for private access.

Note
The option to choose the network configuration of the restored disks the same as that of the source disks or specify the access from specific networks only is currently not available from Azure PowerShell/ Azure CLI.
Cross Region Restore
As one of therestore options, Cross Region Restore (CRR) allows you to restore Azure VMs in a secondary region, which is an Azure paired region.
To begin using the feature, read theBefore You Begin section.
To see if CRR is enabled, follow the instructions inConfigure Cross Region Restore.
Note
Cross-region restore is currently not supported for machines running on Ultra disks.Learn more about Ultra disk backup supportability.
View backup items in secondary region
If CRR is enabled, you can view the backup items in the secondary region.
From the portal, go toRecovery Services vault>Backup items.
SelectSecondary Regionto view the items in the secondary region.
Note
Only Backup Management Types supporting the CRR feature will be shown in the list. Currently, only support for restoring secondary region data to a secondary region is allowed.CRR for Azure VMs is supported for Azure Managed VMs (including encrypted Azure VMs). See themanagement types that support Cross Region Restore.


Restore in secondary region
The secondary region restore user experience will be similar to the primary region restore user experience. When configuring details in the Restore Configuration pane to configure your restore, you'll be prompted to provide only secondary region parameters.
Currently, secondary regionRPOis36 hours. This is because the RPO in the primary region is24 hoursand can take up to12 hoursto replicate the backup data from the primary to the secondary region.


To restore and create a VM, refer toCreate a VM.
To restore as a disk, refer toRestore disks.
Note
The Cross Region Restore feature restores CMK (customer-managed keys) enabled Azure VMs, which aren't backed-up in a CMK enabled Recovery Services vault, as non-CMK enabled VMs in the secondary region.
The Azure roles needed to restore in the secondary region are the same as those in the primary region.
While restoring an Azure VM, Azure Backup configures the virtual network settings in the secondary region automatically. If you arerestoring diskswhile deploying the template, ensure to provide the virtual network settings, corresponding to the secondary region.
If VNet/Subnet is not available in the primary region or is not configured in the secondary region, Azure portal doesn't auto-populate any default values during restore operation.
For Cross Region Restores, theStaging Location(that is the storage account location) must be in the region that the Recovery Services vault treats as thesecondaryregion. For example, a Recovery Services vault is located in East US 2 region (with Geo-Redundancy and Cross Region Restore enabled). This means that thesecondaryregion would beCentral US. Therefore, you need to create a storage account inCentral USto perform a Cross Region Restore of the VM.Learn more aboutAzure cross-region replication pairings for all geographies.
Azure zone pinned VMscan be restored in anyavailability zonesof the same region.
In the restore process, you'll see the optionAvailability Zone.You'll see your default zone first. To choose a different zone, choose the number of the zone of your choice. If the pinned zone is unavailable, you won't be able to restore the data to another zone because the backed-up data isn't zonally replicated. The restore in availability zones is possible from recovery points in vault tier only.
In summary, theAvailability Zonewill only appear when
The source VM is zone pinned and is NOT encrypted
The recovery point is present in vault tier only (Snapshots only or snapshot and vault tier are not supported)
The recovery option is to either create a new VM or to restore disks (replace disks option replaces source data and hence the availability zone option is not applicable)
Creating VM/disks in the same region when vault's storage redundancy is ZRS (Doesn't work when vault's storage redundancy is GRS even though the source VM is zone pinned)
Creating VM/disks in the paired region when vault's storage redundancy is enabled for Cross-Region-Restore AND if the paired region supports zones

Note
Cross region restore jobs once triggered, can't be canceled.

Cross Subscription Restore for Azure VM
Azure Backup now allows you to perform Cross Subscription Restore (CSR), which helps you to restore Azure VMs in a subscription that is different from the default one. Default subscription contains the recovery points.
This feature is enabled for Recovery Services vault by default. However, there may be instances when you may need to block Cross Subscription Restore based on your cloud infrastructure. So, you can enable, disable, or permanently disable Cross Subscription Restore for the existing vaults by going toVault>Properties>Cross Subscription Restore.

Note
CSR once permanently disabled on a vault can't be re-enabled because it's an irreversible operation.
If CSR is disabled but not permanently disabled, then you can reverse the operation by selectingVault>Properties>Cross Subscription Restore>Enable.
If a Recovery Services vault is moved to a different subscription when CSR is disabled or permanently disabled, restore to the original subscription fails.
Restoring unmanaged VMs and disks as managed
You're provided with an option to restoreunmanaged disksasmanaged disksduring restore. By default, the unmanaged VMs / disks are restored as unmanaged VMs / disks. However, if you choose to restore as managed VMs / disks, it's now possible to do so. These restore operations aren't triggered from the snapshot phase but only from the vault phase. This feature isn't available for unmanaged encrypted VMs.

Restore VMs with special configurations
There are many common scenarios in which you might need to restore VMs.
Restore domain controller VMs
For more information, seeBack up and restore Active Directory domain controllers.
Restore VMs with managed identities
Managed identities eliminate the need for the user to maintain the credentials. Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication.
Azure Backup offers the flexibility to restore the managed Azure VM withmanaged identities. You can choose to selectsystem-managed identitiesor user-managed identities as shown in the figure below. This is introduced as one of the input parameters in theRestore configurationbladeof Azure VM. Managed identities are used for accessing the storage accounts and automated cleanup of any resources created during restore process in case of restore failures. These managed identities have to be associated to the vault.

If you choose to select system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities, check for the below actions for managed identity on the target staging Storage Account and Resource Group.

Or, add theVM restore operatorrole assignment on the staging location (Storage Account) and target Resource Group for the successful restore operation.

You can also select theuser-managed identityby providing the input as their MSI Resource ID as provided in the figure below.

Note
The support is available for only managed VMs, and not supported for classic VMs and unmanaged VMs. For thestorage accounts that are restricted with firewalls, system MSI is only supported.
Cross Region Restore isn't supported with managed identities.

After you trigger the restore operation, the backup service creates a job for tracking. Azure Backup displays notifications about the job in the portal. If they aren't visible, select theNotificationssymbol, and then selectMore events in the activity logto see the Restore Process Status.

Track restore as follows:
To view operations for the job, select the notifications hyperlink. Alternatively, in the vault, selectBackup jobs, and then select the relevant VM.

To monitor restore progress, select any restore job with a status ofIn-progress. This displays the progress bar, which displays information about the restore progress:Estimated time of restore: Initially provides the time taken to complete the restore operation. As the operation progresses, the time taken reduces and reaches zero when the restore operation finishes.Percentage of restore. Shows the percentage of restore operation that's done.Number of bytes transferred: If you're restoring by creating a new VM, it shows the bytes that were transferred against the total number of bytes to be transferred.

Post-restore steps
There are a few things to note after restoring a VM:
Extensions present during the backup configuration are installed, but not enabled. If you see an issue, reinstall the extensions. In the case of disk replacement, reinstallation of extensions is not required.

If the backed-up VM had a static IP address, the restored VM will have a dynamic IP address to avoid conflict. You canadd a static IP address to the restored VM.

A restored VM doesn't have an availability set. If you use the restore disk option, then you canspecify an availability setwhen you create a VM from the disk using the provided template or PowerShell.

If you use a cloud-init-based Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, for security reasons the password is blocked after the restore. Use theVMAccessextension on the restored VM toreset the password. We recommend using SSH keys on these distributions, so you don't need to reset the password after the restore.

VMAccess
If you're unable to access a VM once restored because the VM has a broken relationship with the domain controller, then follow the steps below to bring up the VM:Attach OS disk as a data disk to a recovered VM.Manually install VM agent if Azure Agent is found to be unresponsive by following thislink.Enable Serial Console access on VM to allow command-line access to VMbcdedit /store <drive letter>:\boot\bcd /enum

Backing up restored VMs
If you restored a VM to the same resource group with the same name as the originally backed-up VM, backup continues on the VM after restore.
If you restored the VM to a different resource group or you specified a different name for the restored VM, you need to set up backup for the restored VM.
