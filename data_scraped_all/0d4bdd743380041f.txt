An image can be created from a VM and then used to create multiple VMs.
For images stored in an Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery), you can use VMs that already have accounts created on them (specialized) or you can generalize the VM before creating the image to remove machine accounts and other machines specific information. To generalize a VM, seeGeneralized a VM. For more information, seeGeneralized and specialized images.
Important
Once you mark a VM asgeneralizedin Azure, you cannot restart the VM. Legacymanaged imagesare automatically marked as generalized.
generalized
When capturing an image of a virtual machine in Azure, the virtual machine will be temporarily stopped to ensure data consistency and prevent any potential issues during the image creation. This is because capturing an image requires a point-in-time snapshot of the virtual machine's disk.
To avoid disruptions in a production environment, it's recommended you schedule the image capture process during a maintenance window or a time when the temporary downtime won't impacting critical services.

To create the image in a gallery, selectYes, share it to a gallery as an image version.To only create a managed image, selectNo, capture only a managed image. The VM must have been generalized to create a managed image. The only other required information is a name for the image.
