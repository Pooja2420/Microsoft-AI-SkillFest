Note
Azure Automation State Configuration will be retired on September 30, 2027, please transition toAzure Machine Configurationby that date. For more information, see theblog postannouncement. The Azure Machine Configuration service combines features of DSC Extension, Azure
Automation State Configuration, and the most commonly requested features from customer feedback.
Azure Machine Configuration also includes hybrid machine support throughArc-enabled servers.
Important
TheAdd,Compose configuration, andGallerynavigation links will be removed from the
portal on March 31, 2025.
Caution
Azure Automation DSC for Linux has retired on 30 September 2023. For more information, see theannouncement.
This article provides a step-by-step guide for doing the most common tasks with Azure Automation
State Configuration, such as:
creating, importing, and compiling configurations
enabling machines to manage
viewing reports
For an overview State Configuration, seeState Configuration overview. For Desired State
Configuration (DSC) documentation, seeWindows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Overview.
If you want a sample environment that is already set up without following the steps described in
this article, you can use theAzure Automation Managed Node template. This template sets up a
complete State Configuration (DSC) environment, including an Azure virtual machine managed by State
Configuration (DSC).
Prerequisites
To complete the examples in this article, the following are required:
An Azure Automation account. To learn more about an Automation account and its requirements, seeAutomation Account authentication overview.
An Azure Resource Manager VM (not Classic) running asupported operating system. For
instructions on creating a VM, seeCreate your first Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal
Create a DSC configuration
You create a simpleDSC configurationthat ensures either the presence or absence of theWeb-ServerWindows Feature (IIS), depending on how you assign nodes.
Configuration names in Azure Automation must be limited to no more than 100 characters.
StartVS Code(or any text editor).

Compile a configuration in Azure Automation
Before you can apply a desired state to a node, a DSC configuration defining that state must be
compiled into one or more node configurations (MOF document), and placed on the Automation DSC Pull
Server. For a more detailed description of compiling configurations in State Configuration (DSC),
seeCompile configurations in Azure Automation State Configuration. For more information about
compiling configurations, seeDSC Configurations.

View a compilation job
After you start a compilation, you can view it in theCompilation Jobstile on theConfigurationpage. TheCompilation Jobstile shows currently running, completed, and failed
jobs. When you open a compilation job pane, it shows information about that job including any errors
or warnings encountered, input parameters used in the configuration, and compilation logs.

View node configurations
Successful completion of a compilation job creates one or more new node configurations. A node
configuration is a MOF document that you deploy to the pull server. You can view the node
configurations in your Automation account on the State configuration (DSC) page. A node
configuration has a name with the formConfigurationName.NodeName.

Enable an Azure Resource Manager VM for management with State Configuration
You can use State Configuration to manage Azure VMs (both classic and Resource Manager), on-premises
VMs, Linux machines, AWS VMs, and on-premises physical machines. In this article, you learn how to
enable only Azure Resource Manager VMs. For information about enabling other types of machines, seeEnable machines for management by Azure Automation State Configuration.

Azure starts the process of enabling the VM. When complete, the VM shows up in theNodestab of
the State configuration (DSC) page in the Automation account.
View the list of managed nodes
TheNodestab of the State configuration (DSC) page contains a list of all machines enabled for
management in your Automation account.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the left, selectAll resourcesand then the name of your Automation account.
On the Automation account page, selectState configuration (DSC)underConfiguration
Management.
On the State configuration (DSC) page, select theNodestab.
DSC nodes status values
The DSC node can take any of the following six values as follows:
Failed- This status is displayed when an error occurs while applying one or more
configurations on a node.
Not compliant- This status is displayed when drift occurs on a node and it requires a close
review.
Unresponsive- This status is displayed when a node hasn't been checked in for more than 24
hours.
Pending- This status is displayed when a node has a new configuration to apply and the pull
server is waiting for the node to check in.
In progress- This status is displayed when a node applies configuration, and the pull server
is awaiting status.
Compliant- This status is displayed when a node has a valid configuration, and no drift
occurs presently.
Note
RefreshFrequencyMins- It defines the frequency of node contacting the agent service and can
be provided as part of onboarding to DSC. It takes a maximum value of 10080 minutes.
Node will be marked asUnresponsiveif the node does not contact the agent service for 1440
minutes (1 Day). We recommend that you useRefreshFrequencyMinsvalue < 1440 minutes, else
the node would show in a falseUnresponsivestate.
View reports for managed nodes
Each time State Configuration performs a consistency check on a managed node, the node sends a
status report back to the pull server. You can view these reports on the page for that node.

Any errors, including the error code and error message.
Any DSC resources used in the configuration, and the state of each resource (whether the node is
in the desired state for that resource). You can select on each resource to get more detailed
information for that resource.
The name, IP address, and configuration mode of the node.
You can also selectView raw reportto see the actual data that the node sends to the server. For
more information about using that data, seeUsing a DSC report server.
It can take some time before the first report is available, after a node is enabled or restarted. You might need to wait up to 30 minutes after you enable a node or restart a node.

You can assign a node to use a different node configuration than the one you initially assigned.
