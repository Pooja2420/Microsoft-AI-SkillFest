As part of the Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster lifecycle, you need to perform periodic upgrades to the latest version of the OpenShift platform. Upgrading your Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters enables you to upgrade to the latest features and functionalities and apply the latest security releases.
This article shows you how to upgrade all components in an OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift web console or the managed-upgrade-operator (MUO).
Before you begin
This article requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.6.0 or later. Runaz --versionto find your current version. If you need to install or upgrade Azure CLI/it, seeInstall Azure CLI.

This article assumes you've updated your Azure Red Hat OpenShift pull secret for an existing Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4.x cluster. Including thecloud.openshift.comentry from your pull secret enables your cluster to start sending telemetry data to Red Hat.For more information, seeAdd or update your Red Hat pull secret on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster.

Make sure that the credentials for the service principal used for the cluster are valid/updated before starting the upgrade. For more information, seeRotate service principal credentials for your Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) Cluster.

Check for Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster upgrades
From the top-left of the OpenShift web console, which is the default when you sign as the kubeadmin, select theAdministrationtab.

SelectCluster Settingsand open theDetailstab. You'll see the version, update status, and channel. The channel isn't configured by default.

Select theChannellink, and at the prompt enter the desired update channel, for examplestable-4.10. Once the desired channel is chosen, a graph showing available releases and channels is displayed. If theUpdate Statusfor your cluster showsUpdates Available, you can update your cluster.

Upgrade your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift web console
From the OpenShift web console in the previous step, set theChannelto the correct channel for the version that you want to update to, such asstable-4.10.
stable-4.10
Selection a version to update to, and selectUpdate. You'll see the update status change to:Update to <product-version> in progress. You can review the progress of the cluster update by watching the progress bars for the operators and nodes.
Update to <product-version> in progress
Scheduling individual upgrades using the managed-upgrade-operator
Use the managed-upgrade-operator (MUO) to upgrade your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
The managed-upgrade-operator manages automated cluster upgrades. The managed-upgrade-operator starts the cluster upgrade, but it doesn't perform any activities of the cluster upgrade process itself. The OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is responsible for upgrading the clusters. The goal of the managed-upgrade-operator is to satisfy the operating conditions that a managed cluster must hold, both before and after starting the cluster upgrade.
Prepare the configuration file, as shown in the following example for upgrading to OpenShift 4.10.
apiVersion: upgrade.managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UpgradeConfig
metadata:
  name: managed-upgrade-config
  namespace: openshift-managed-upgrade-operator
spec:
  type: "ARO"
  upgradeAt: "2022-02-08T03:20:00Z"
  PDBForceDrainTimeout: 60
  desired:
    channel: "stable-4.10"
    version: "4.10.10"
apiVersion: upgrade.managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UpgradeConfig
metadata:
  name: managed-upgrade-config
  namespace: openshift-managed-upgrade-operator
spec:
  type: "ARO"
  upgradeAt: "2022-02-08T03:20:00Z"
  PDBForceDrainTimeout: 60
  desired:
    channel: "stable-4.10"
    version: "4.10.10"
where:
channelis the channel the configuration file will pull from, according to the lifecycle policy. The channel used should bestable-4.10.
channel
stable-4.10
versionis the version that you wish to upgrade to, such as4.10.10.
version
4.10.10
upgradeATis the time when the upgrade will take place.

Apply the configuration file:
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
