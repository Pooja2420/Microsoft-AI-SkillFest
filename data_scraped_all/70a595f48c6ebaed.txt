Azure NAT Gateway is a fully managed, highly resilient service that ensures that all outbound internet-facing traffic is routed through a network address translation (NAT) gateway. It can be associated with one or more subnets. There are two important scenarios in which you can use a NAT gateway with Azure App Service.
A NAT gateway gives you a static, predictable public IP address for outbound internet-facing traffic. Using a NAT gateway also significantly increases the availablesource network address translation (SNAT) portsin scenarios where you have a high number of concurrent connections to the same public address/port combination.

Here are important considerations about Azure NAT Gateway integration:
Whether you can use NAT gateway with App Service is dependent on virtual network integration, so you must have a supported pricing tier in an App Service plan.
When you use a NAT gateway together with App Service, all traffic to Azure Storage must use private endpoints or service endpoints.
You can't use a NAT gateway together with App Service Environment v1 or v2.
For more information and pricing, seeAzure NAT Gateway overview.
Configure NAT gateway integration
To configure NAT gateway integration with App Service, first complete the following tasks:
Configure regional virtual network integration with your app, as described inIntegrate your app with an Azure virtual network.

Ensure thatRoute Allis enabled for your virtual network integration, so routes in your virtual network affect the internet-bound traffic.

Set up Azure NAT Gateway through the Azure portal
In the Azure portal, go toApp Service>Networking. In theOutbound Trafficsection, selectVirtual network integration. Ensure that your app is integrated with a subnet and thatRoute Allis enabled.

Fill in tags if needed, and then selectCreate. After the NAT gateway is provisioned, selectGo to resource group, and then select the new NAT gateway. TheOutbound IPpane shows the public IP address that your app uses for outbound internet-facing traffic.

If you prefer to use the Azure CLI to configure your environment, use the following commands. As a prerequisite, create an app with virtual network integration configured.
Ensure thatRoute Allis configured for your virtual network integration:az webapp config set --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name [myWebApp] --vnet-route-all-enabled
Ensure thatRoute Allis configured for your virtual network integration:
az webapp config set --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name [myWebApp] --vnet-route-all-enabled
az webapp config set --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name [myWebApp] --vnet-route-all-enabled
Create a public IP address and a NAT gateway:az network public-ip create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myPublicIP --sku standard --allocation static

az network nat gateway create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myNATgateway --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP --idle-timeout 10
Create a public IP address and a NAT gateway:
az network public-ip create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myPublicIP --sku standard --allocation static

az network nat gateway create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myNATgateway --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP --idle-timeout 10
az network public-ip create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myPublicIP --sku standard --allocation static

az network nat gateway create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myNATgateway --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP --idle-timeout 10
Associate the NAT gateway with the subnet for virtual network integration:az network vnet subnet update --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --vnet-name [myVnet] --name [myIntegrationSubnet] --nat-gateway myNATgateway
Associate the NAT gateway with the subnet for virtual network integration:
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --vnet-name [myVnet] --name [myIntegrationSubnet] --nat-gateway myNATgateway
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --vnet-name [myVnet] --name [myIntegrationSubnet] --nat-gateway myNATgateway
Scale a NAT gateway
You can use the same NAT gateway across multiple subnets in the same virtual network. That approach allows you to use a NAT gateway across multiple apps and App Service plans.
Azure NAT Gateway supports both public IP addresses and public IP prefixes. A NAT gateway can support up to 16 IP addresses across individual IP addresses and prefixes. Each IP address allocates 64,512 ports (SNAT ports), which allow up to one million available ports. Learn more inAzure NAT Gateway resource.
