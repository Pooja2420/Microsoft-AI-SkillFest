The Azure Connected Machine agent lets you manage Windows and Linux machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network or other cloud providers.
Warning
Only Connected Machineagent versionswithin the last one year are officially supported by the product group. Customers should update to an agent version within this window.
Agent components

The Azure Connected Machine agent package contains several logical components bundled together:
The Hybrid Instance Metadata service (HIMDS) manages the connection to Azure and the connected machine's Azure identity.
The Hybrid Instance Metadata service (HIMDS) manages the connection to Azure and the connected machine's Azure identity.
The machine configuration agent provides functionality such as assessing whether the machine complies with required policies and enforcing compliance.Note the following behavior with Azure Policymachine configurationfor a disconnected machine:An Azure Policy assignment that targets disconnected machines is unaffected.Guest assignment is stored locally for 14 days. Within the 14-day period, if the Connected Machine agent reconnects to the service, policy assignments are reapplied.Assignments are deleted after 14 days, and aren't reassigned to the machine after the 14-day period.

Assignments are deleted after 14 days, and aren't reassigned to the machine after the 14-day period.
The Extension agent manages VM extensions, including install, uninstall, and upgrade. Azure downloads extensions and copies them to the%SystemDrive%\%ProgramFiles%\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\ExtensionService\downloadsfolder on Windows, and to/opt/GC_Ext/downloadson Linux. On Windows, the extension installs to the following path%SystemDrive%\Packages\Plugins\<extension>, and on Linux the extension installs to/var/lib/waagent/<extension>.

Note
TheAzure Monitor agent (AMA)is a separate agent that collects monitoring data. It doesn't replace the Connected Machine agent. The AMA only replaces the Log Analytics agent, Diagnostics extension, and Telegraf agent for both Windows and Linux machines.
Azure Arc Proxy
The Azure Arc Proxy service is responsible for aggregating network traffic from the Azure Connected Machine agent services and any extensions and deciding where to route that data. If youâre using theAzure Arc gateway (Limited preview)to simplify your network endpoints, the Azure Arc Proxy service is the local component that forwards network requests via the Azure Arc gateway instead of the default route. The Azure Arc Proxy runs as a Network Service on Windows and a standard user account (arcproxy) on Linux. It's disabled by default until you configure the agent to use the Azure Arc gateway (Limited preview).

Agent resource governance
The Azure Connected Machine agent is designed to manage agent and system resource consumption. The agent approaches resource governance under the following conditions:
The Machine Configuration (formerly Guest Configuration) service can use up to 5% of the CPU to evaluate policies.
The Machine Configuration (formerly Guest Configuration) service can use up to 5% of the CPU to evaluate policies.
The Extension service can use up to 5% of the CPU on Windows machines and 30% of the CPU on Linux machines to install, upgrade, run, and delete extensions. Some extensions might apply more restrictive CPU limits once installed. The following exceptions apply:Extension typeOperating systemCPU limitAzureMonitorLinuxAgentLinux60%AzureMonitorWindowsAgentWindows100%LinuxOsUpdateExtensionLinux60%MDE.LinuxLinux60%MicrosoftDnsAgentWindows100%MicrosoftMonitoringAgentWindows60%OmsAgentForLinuxLinux60%
The Extension service can use up to 5% of the CPU on Windows machines and 30% of the CPU on Linux machines to install, upgrade, run, and delete extensions. Some extensions might apply more restrictive CPU limits once installed. The following exceptions apply:
During normal operations, defined as the Azure Connected Machine agent being connected to Azure and not actively modifying an extension or evaluating a policy, you can expect the agent to consume the following system resources:
The performance data above was gathered in April 2023 on virtual machines running Windows Server 2022 and Ubuntu 20.04. Actual agent performance and resource consumption vary based on the hardware and software configuration of your servers.
Custom resource limits
The default resource governance limits are the best choice for most servers. However, small virtual machines and servers with limited CPU resources might encounter time-outs when managing extensions or evaluating policies because there aren't enough CPU resources to complete the tasks. Starting with agent version 1.39, you can customize the CPU limits applied to the extension manager and Machine Configuration services to help the agent complete these tasks faster.
To see the current resource limits for the extension manager and Machine Configuration services, run the following command.
azcmagent config list
azcmagent config list
In the output, you'll see two fields,guestconfiguration.agent.cpulimitandextensions.agent.cpulimitwith the current resource limit specified as a percentage. On a fresh install of the agent, both will show5because the default limit is 5% of the CPU.
guestconfiguration.agent.cpulimit
extensions.agent.cpulimit
5
To change the resource limit for the extension manager to 80%, run the following command:
azcmagent config set extensions.agent.cpulimit 80
azcmagent config set extensions.agent.cpulimit 80

The agent requests the following metadata information from Azure:
Resource location (region)
Virtual machine ID
Tags
Microsoft Entra managed identity certificate
Machine configuration policy assignments
Extension requests - install, update, and delete.
Note
Azure Arc-enabled servers does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or end-user identifiable information or store any customer data.
Customer metadata isn't stored or processed outside the region the customer deploys the service instance in.
Deployment options and requirements
Agent deployment and machine connection require certainprerequisites. There are alsonetworking requirementsto be aware of.
We provide several options for deploying the agent. For more information, seePlan for deploymentandDeployment options.
Cloning guidelines
You can safely install the azcmagent package into a golden image, but once you connect a machine using theazcmagent connectcommand, that machine receives specific resource information. If you're building machines by cloning them from a golden image, you must first specialize each machine before connecting it to Azure with theazcmagent connectcommand. Don't connect the original golden image machine to Azure until you've created and specialized each machine.
azcmagent connect
azcmagent connect
If your connected server is receiving 429 error messages, it's likely that you connected the server to Azure and then used that server as the golden image for cloning. Since the resource information was recorded into the image, cloned machines created from that image try to send heartbeat messages to the same resource.
To resolve 429 error messages for existing machines, runazcmagent disconnect --force-local-onlyon each cloned machine, then rerunazcmagent connectusing an appropriate credential to connect the machines to the cloud using a unique resource name.
azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only
azcmagent connect
Disaster Recovery
There are no customer-enabled disaster recovery options for Arc-enabled servers. In the event of an outage in an Azure region, the system will fail over to another region in the sameAzure geography(if one exists). While this failover procedure is automatic, it does take some time. The Connected Machine agent is disconnected during this period and shows a status ofDisconnecteduntil the failover is complete. The system will fail back to its original region once the outage has been resolved.
An outage of Azure Arc will not affect the customer workload itself; only management of the applicable servers via Arc will be impaired.
Next steps
To begin evaluating Azure Arc-enabled servers, seeQuickstart: Connect hybrid machines with Azure Arc-enabled servers.
Before you deploy the Azure Connected Machine agent and integrate with other Azure management and monitoring services, review thePlanning and deployment guide.
