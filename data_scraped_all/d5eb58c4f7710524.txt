Itâs a good practice to test your assumptions about how your services respond to an attack by conducting periodic simulations. During testing, validate that your services or applications continue to function as expected and thereâs no disruption to the user experience. Identify gaps from both a technology and process standpoint and incorporate them in the DDoS response strategy. We recommend that you perform such tests in staging environments or during nonpeak hours to minimize the impact to the production environment.
For this tutorial, you'll create a test environment that includes:
A DDoS protection plan
A virtual network
An Azure Bastion host
A load balancer
Two virtual machines
You'll then configure diagnostic logs and alerts to monitor for attacks and traffic patterns. Finally, you'll configure a DDoS attack simulation using one of our approved testing partners.

Simulations help you:
Validate how Azure DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
Optimize your incident response process while under DDoS attack.
Document DDoS compliance.
Train your network security teams.
Azure DDoS simulation testing policy
You can only simulate attacks using our approved testing partners:
BreakingPoint Cloud: a self-service traffic generator where your customers can generate traffic against DDoS Protection-enabled public endpoints for simulations.
MazeBolt: The RADARâ¢ platform continuously identifies and enables the elimination of DDoS vulnerabilities â proactively and with zero disruption to business operations.
Red Button: work with a dedicated team of experts to simulate real-world DDoS attack scenarios in a controlled environment.
RedWolf: a self-service or guided DDoS testing provider with real-time control.
Our testing partners' simulation environments are built within Azure. You can only simulate against Azure-hosted public IP addresses that belong to an Azure subscription of your own, which will be validated by our partners before testing. Additionally, these target public IP addresses must be protected under Azure DDoS Protection. Simulation testing allows you to assess your current state of readiness, identify gaps in your incident response procedures, and guide you in developing a properâ¯DDoS response strategy.
Note
BreakingPoint Cloud and Red Button are only available for the Public cloud.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.
In order to use diagnostic logging, you must first create aLog Analytics workspace with diagnostic settings enabled.
For this tutorial you'll need to deploy a Load Balancer, a public IP address, Bastion, and two virtual machines. For more information, seeDeploy Load Balancer with DDoS Protection. You can skip the NAT Gateway step in the Deploy Load Balancer with DDoS Protection tutorial.

In this tutorial, we'll configure DDoS Protection metrics and alerts to monitor for attacks and traffic patterns.

Red Button
Red ButtonâsDDoS Testingservice suite includes three stages:
Planning session: Red Button experts meet with your team to understand your network architecture, assemble technical details, and define clear goals and testing schedules. This includes planning the DDoS test scope and targets, attack vectors, and attack rates. The joint planning effort is detailed in a test plan document.
Controlled DDoS attack: Based on the defined goals, the Red Button team launches a combination of multi-vector DDoS attacks. The test typically lasts between three to six hours. Attacks are securely executed using dedicated servers and are controlled and monitored using Red Buttonâs management console.
Summary and recommendations: The Red Button team provides you with a written DDoS Test Report outlining the effectiveness of DDoS mitigation. The report includes an executive summary of the test results, a complete log of the simulation, a list of vulnerabilities within your infrastructure, and recommendations on how to correct them.
In addition, Red Button offers two other service suites,DDoS 360andDDoS Incident Response, that can complement the DDoS Testing service suite.
RedWolf
RedWolf offers an easy-to-use testing system that is either self-serve or guided by RedWolf experts. RedWolf testing system allows customers to set up attack vectors. Customers can specify attack sizes with real-time control on settings to simulate real-world DDoS attack scenarios in a controlled environment.
RedWolf'sDDoS Testingservice suite includes:
Attack Vectors: Unique cloud attacks designed by RedWolf. For more information about RedWolf attack vectors, seeTechnical Details.
