Azure Data Explorer provides a web experience that enables you to connect to your Azure Data Explorer clusters and write, run, and shareKusto Query Language (KQL)commands and queries. The web experience is available in the Azure portal and as a stand-alone web application, theAzure Data Explorer web UI. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to query data in the stand-alone Azure Data Explorer web UI.
In the Azure Data Explorer web UI, the query editor provides suggestions and warnings as you write your queries. To customize which suggestions and warnings you receive, seeSet query recommendations.
Prerequisites
A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity. An Azure subscription isn't required.
An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. Use the publicly availablehelpclusterorcreate a cluster and database.
Sign in to theAzure Data Explorer web UI.
Add clusters
When you first open the web UI, in theQuerypage, you should see a connection to thehelpcluster. The examples in this quickstart use theStormEventstable in theSamplesdatabase of thehelpcluster.
StormEvents
Samples
If you want to run queries on a different cluster, you must add a connection to that cluster.
To add a new cluster connection, do the following:
On the left menu, selectQuery.
In the upper left pane, selectAdd connection.
In theAdd connectiondialog box, enter the clusterConnection URIandDisplay name.
SelectAddto add the connection.
If you don't see thehelpcluster, add it using the previous steps. Use "help" as theConnection URI.
Run queries
To run a query, you must select the database on which you want to run the query in order to set the query context.
In theCluster connectionpane, under thehelpcluster, select theSamplesdatabase.
In theCluster connectionpane, under thehelpcluster, select theSamplesdatabase.

Copy and paste the following query into the query window. At the top of the window, selectRun.Run the queryStormEvents

Clean up resources
You didn't create any resources in this quickstart, but if you'd like to remove one or both clusters from the application, right-click the cluster and selectRemove connection.
Another option is to selectClear local statefrom theSettings>Generaltab. This action will remove all cluster connections and close all open query tabs.
