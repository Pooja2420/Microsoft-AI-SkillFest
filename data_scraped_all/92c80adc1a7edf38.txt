Azure Front Door (classic) will be retired onMarch 31, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure Front Door (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by March 2027. For more information, seeAzure Front Door (classic) retirement.
This article shows how to add a custom domain to your Front Door. When you use Azure Front Door for application delivery, a custom domain is necessary if you want your own domain name to be visible in your end-user request. Having a visible domain name can be convenient for your customers and useful for branding purposes.
After you create a Front Door profile, the default frontend host is a subdomain ofazurefd.net. This name is included in the URL for delivering Front Door content to your backend by default. For example,https://contoso-frontend.azurefd.net. For your convenience, Azure Front Door provides the option to associate a custom domain to the endpoint. With this capability, you can deliver your content with your URL instead of the Front Door default domain name such as,https://www.contoso.com/photo.png.
azurefd.net
https://contoso-frontend.azurefd.net
https://www.contoso.com/photo.png
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.

Prerequisites
Before you can complete the steps in this tutorial, you must first create a Front Door. For more information, seeQuickstart: Create a Front Door.

If you don't already have a custom domain, you must first purchase one with a domain provider. For example, seeBuy a custom domain name.

If you're using Azure to host yourDNS domains, you must delegate the domain provider's domain name system (DNS) to an Azure DNS. For more information, seeDelegate a domain to Azure DNS. Otherwise, if you're using a domain provider to handle your DNS domain, continue toCreate a CNAME DNS record.

Create a CNAME DNS record
Before you can use a custom domain with your Front Door, you must first create a canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider to point to the Front Door default frontend host. A CNAME record is a type of DNS record that maps a source domain name to a destination domain name. In Azure Front Door, the source domain name is your custom domain name and the destination domain name is your Front Door default hostname. Once Front Door verifies the CNAME record gets created, traffic to the source custom domain gets routed to the specified destination Front Door default frontend host.
A custom domain can only be associated with one Front Door profile at a time. However, you can have different subdomains of an apex domain in the same or a different Front Door profile.
Map the temporary afdverify subdomain
When you map an existing domain that is in production, there are things consider. While you're registering your custom domain in the Azure portal, a brief period of downtime for the domain might occur. To avoid interruption of web traffic, map your custom domain to your Front Door default frontend host with the Azure afdverify subdomain first to create a temporary CNAME mapping. Your users can access your domain without interruption when the DNS mapping occurs.
If you're using your custom domain for the first time with no production traffic, you can directly map your custom domain to your Front Door. You can skip ahead toMap the permanent custom domain.
To create a CNAME record with the afdverify subdomain:
Sign in to the web site of the domain provider for your custom domain.
Sign in to the web site of the domain provider for your custom domain.
Find the page for managing DNS records by consulting the provider's documentation or searching for areas of the web site labeledDomain Name,DNS, orName server management.

Warning
Youmustensure that each of the frontend hosts (including custom domains) in your Front Door has a routing rule with a default path ('/*') associated with it. That is, across all of your routing rules there must be at least one routing rule for each of your frontend hosts defined at the default path ('/*'). Failing to do so, may result in your end-user traffic not getting routed correctly.
Verify the custom domain
After you complete the registration of your custom domain, verify that the custom domain references your default Front Door frontend host.
In your browser, navigate to the address of the file by using the custom domain. For example, if your custom domain is robotics.contoso.com, the URL to the cached file should be similar to the following URL: http://robotics.contoso.com/my-public-container/my-file.jpg. Verify that the result is that same as when you access the Front Door directly at<Front Door host>.azurefd.net.
Map the permanent custom domain
To proceed with mapping the custom domain directly to your default Front Door frontend host, you need to ensure that the afdverify subdomain was successfully mapped to your Front Door. Once verified, you can proceed with mapping the custom domain.

Clean up resources
In the preceding steps, you added a custom domain to a Front Door. If you no longer want to associate your Front Door with a custom domain, you can remove the custom domain by doing these steps:
Go to your DNS provider, delete the CNAME record for the custom domain, or update the CNAME record for the custom domain to a non Front Door endpoint.ImportantTo prevent dangling DNS entries and the security risks they create, starting from April 9th 2021, Azure Front Door requires removal of the CNAME records to Front Door endpoints before the resources can be deleted. Resources include Front Door custom domains, Front Door endpoints or Azure resource groups that has Front Door custom domain(s) enabled.
