In this guide, you learn about data sources supported in each Azure Managed Grafana plan and learn how to add, manage and remove these data sources.
Prerequisites
An Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
Required Grafana role: Grafana Editor.
Supported Grafana data sources
By design, Grafana can be configured with multipledata sources. A data source is an externalized storage backend that holds telemetry information.
Grafana built-in core data sources
Azure Managed Grafana supports many popular data sources. The table below lists the Grafana core data sources that can be added to Azure Managed Grafana for each service tier.
Grafana Enterprise data sources
Within the Standard service tier, users who have subscribed to the Grafana Enterprise option can also access the following data sources.
AppDynamics
Azure DevOps
Databricks
Datadog
Dynatrace
GitLab
Honeycomb
Jira
Looker
MongoDB
New Relic
Oracle Database
Salesforce
SAP HANAÂ®
ServiceNow
Snowflake
Splunk
Splunk Infrastructure monitoring (SignalFx)
Sqlyze Datasource
Sumo Logic
Wavefront
Other data sources
Customers with a Standard tier plan can access additional data sources from thePlugin management (preview) feature.
For more information about data sources, go toData sourceson the Grafana Labs website.
Add a data source
To add a data source to Azure Managed Grafana, follow the steps below.
Portal
Azure CLI
Core Grafana pluginsare installed in your workspace by default. If you want to use another type of data source, you first need to install its plugin by following the instructions available atAdd a plugin.

Run theaz grafana data-source createcommand to add aGrafana core data sourcewith the Azure CLI.
For example, to add an Azure SQL data source, run:
az grafana data-source create --name <workspace-name> --definition '{
  "access": "proxy",
  "database": "testdb",
  "jsonData": {
    "authenticationType": "SQL Server Authentication",
    "encrypt": "false"
  },
  "secureJsonData": {
    "password": "verySecretPassword"
  },
  "name": "Microsoft SQL Server",
  "type": "mssql",
  "url": "<url>",
  "user": "<user>"
}'
az grafana data-source create --name <workspace-name> --definition '{
  "access": "proxy",
  "database": "testdb",
  "jsonData": {
    "authenticationType": "SQL Server Authentication",
    "encrypt": "false"
  },
  "secureJsonData": {
    "password": "verySecretPassword"
  },
  "name": "Microsoft SQL Server",
  "type": "mssql",
  "url": "<url>",
  "user": "<user>"
}'
Tip
If you can't connect to a data source, you may need tomodify access permissionsto allow access from your Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
Configure a data source
The content below shows how to configure some of the most popular data sources in Azure Managed Grafana: Azure Monitor and Azure Data Explorer. A similar process can be used to configure other types of data sources. For more information about a specific data source, refer toGrafana's documentation.
Azure Monitor
The Azure Monitor data source is automatically added to all new Azure Managed Grafana resources. To review or modify its configuration, follow the steps below in the Grafana portal of your Azure Managed Grafana workspace or in the Azure CLI.
Portal
Azure CLI
Deploy the menu on the left and selectConnections>Data sources.

Azure Monitor is listed as a built-in data source for your Azure Managed Grafana workspace. SelectAzure Monitor.

In theSettingstab, authenticate throughManaged Identityand select your subscription from the dropdown list, or alternatively enter yourApp Registrationdetails. When you selectManaged identity, the authentication and authorization are made through the system-assigned or the user-assigned managed identity youconfigured in your Azure Managed Grafana workspace. Using a managed identity lets you assign permissions for your Azure Managed Grafana workspace to access Azure Monitor data without having to manually manage service principals in Microsoft Entra ID.

Run theaz grafana data-source updatecommand to update the configuration of your Azure Monitor data sources using the Azure CLI.
For example:
az grafana data-source update --data-source 'Azure Monitor' --name <workspace-name> --definition '{ 
  "datasource": {
    "access": "proxy",
    "basicAuth": false,
    "basicAuthUser": "",
    "database": "",
    "id": 1,
    "isDefault": false,
    "jsonData": {
      "azureAuthType": "msi",
      "subscriptionId": "<subscription-ID>"
    },
    "name": "Azure Monitor",
    "orgId": 1,
    "readOnly": false,
    "secureJsonFields": {},
    "type": "grafana-azure-monitor-datasource",
    "typeLogoUrl": "",
    "uid": "azure-monitor-oob",
    "url": "",
    "user": "",
    "version": 1,
    "withCredentials": false
  },
  "id": 1,
  "message": "Datasource updated",
  "name": "Azure Monitor"
}
az grafana data-source update --data-source 'Azure Monitor' --name <workspace-name> --definition '{ 
  "datasource": {
    "access": "proxy",
    "basicAuth": false,
    "basicAuthUser": "",
    "database": "",
    "id": 1,
    "isDefault": false,
    "jsonData": {
      "azureAuthType": "msi",
      "subscriptionId": "<subscription-ID>"
    },
    "name": "Azure Monitor",
    "orgId": 1,
    "readOnly": false,
    "secureJsonFields": {},
    "type": "grafana-azure-monitor-datasource",
    "typeLogoUrl": "",
    "uid": "azure-monitor-oob",
    "url": "",
    "user": "",
    "version": 1,
    "withCredentials": false
  },
  "id": 1,
  "message": "Datasource updated",
  "name": "Azure Monitor"
}
Azure Data Explorer
To learn how to configure Azure Data Explorer, go toConfigure Azure Data Explorer.
Remove a data source
This section describes the steps for removing a data source.
Caution
Removing a data source that is used in a dashboard will make the dashboard unable to collect the corresponding data and will trigger an error or result in no data being shown in the panel.
Portal
Azure CLI
Remove a data source in the Azure portal:
Open your Azure Managed Grafana workspace in the Azure portal.
SelectOverviewfrom the left menu, then open theEndpointURL.
In the Grafana portal, go toConnections>Your connections
Select the data source you want to remove and selectDelete.
Run theaz grafana data-source deletecommand to remove an Azure Managed Grafana data source using the Azure CLI. In the sample below, replace the placeholders<workspace-name>and<id>with the name of the Azure Managed Grafana workspace and the name, ID or UID of the data source.
<workspace-name>
<id>
az grafana data-source delete --name <workspace-name> --data-source <id>
az grafana data-source delete --name <workspace-name> --data-source <id>
