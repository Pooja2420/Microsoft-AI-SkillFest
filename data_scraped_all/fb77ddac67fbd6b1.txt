Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS) offer a web-based solution for manual testing.Azure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS is a web-based manual testing solution, which works across all platforms and with all browsers. It provides experiences across Plan, Author, Execute and Track stages of Manual testing.
In the past, we have also shipped a client based solution as Microsoft Test Manager. The Test Center in Microsoft Test Manager client is a desktop-based manual testing solution, which has traditionally been used by testers for their manual testing needs (seeRun manual tests with Microsoft Test Manager).
Note
Microsoft Test Manager has been deprecated. It has been replaced withAzure Test Plans, a fully featured test management solution. Microsoft Test Manager 2017, which shipped with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, is the last version available. This topic will help you understand whyAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS is a more comprehensive solution for manual testing compared to Microsoft Test Manager.
Supported combinations
Manual Testing
Azure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS is a fully-featured test management solution spanning all stages of the testing lifecycle. It works on all platforms (such as Linux, macOS, Windows, and others) and all browsers (such as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and others). You can easily get started using manual testing
features right from your Kanban board, and use it for more advanced manual testing capabilities. This topic describes the capabilities included inAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS.
Test planning

The copy/clone capability is surfaced via the following APIs:Copy/Clone a Test PlanandCopy/Clone a Test Suite. We plan to expose this capability through the out-of-box UI in a future release.
Test authoring
You can easily get started creating test cases right from your Kanban board in theWork hub. Easily add, view, interact with, and execute tests from your Kanban cards, and create multiple test cases using a grid inAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS. Create shared parameters and use them in multiple test cases for data driven testing.

Test execution
Test your web apps and your desktop apps.
Azure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS provides a browser based Test Runner and a client based Test Runner which you can use to test your web and desktop apps.
Using either runner, you can mark test steps and test outcomes as pass or fail, and collect diagnostic information such as system information, image action logs, screen recordings and screen captures during your tests. Alternatively, you can use the Microsoft Test Runner client that is part of Microsoft Test Manager.

The test runners offered through the web-based hub does not support Action Recording (fast-forward test steps), Advanced Data collection (code coverage, IntelliTrace, and test impact) during your tests and Connecting to a machine in an environment. These 3 capabilities were not leveraged by our customers much and hence not being taken forward. You may however use the Microsoft Test Runner client, launched fromAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS, for these requirements if really required.
Test tracking
You can easily track your manual testing results using your chosen light-weight chart types, and pin them to your dashboard to quickly analyze the test results.
View test case result history across test suites and test plans easily by using the right-hand pane in theTest planspage ofAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS.
You can also select a retention policy to specify how long you want to keep your manual testing results.
Exploratory Testing
Use the lightweightTest & Feedback browser extensionto perform exploratory testing on your web applications.
You can collect rich diagnostic data such as screen captures, screen recording, and image action logs using this extension.
The extension also has the capability to capture page load data for your web applications. InAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS you can view completed exploratory
testing sessions and derive meaningful insights at team or individual level, and for a specific period.
To explore your desktop applications, you can use the Exploratory Test Runner client in Microsoft Test Manager by launching it fromAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS.

Conclusion
Azure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS is a richer, faster, and easier-to-use solution for manual testing as compared to the Test Center in Microsoft Test Manager. It works on all platforms and all browsers, and has a rich and modern web UI that improves your testing experience across all stages of manual testing.
All the test plans, test suites, test cases, results and other test management data you create using Microsoft Test Manager are stored in Azure DevOps or TFS. Hence, existing Microsoft Test Manager users can easily get started usingAzure Test Plansor theTesthub in TFS without any data loss.
