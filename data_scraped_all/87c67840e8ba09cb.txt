When an Azure Private Endpoint is created, it uses Azure Private DNS Zones for name resolution by default. For on-premises workloads to access the endpoint, a forwarder to a virtual machine in Azure hosting DNS or on-premises DNS records for the private endpoint were required. Azure Private Resolver alleviates the need to deploy a VM in Azure for DNS or manage the private endpoint DNS records on an on-premises DNS server.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create an Azure Virtual Network for the cloud network and a simulated on-premises network with virtual network peering.
Create a Azure Web App to simulate a cloud resource.
Create an Azure Private Endpoint for the web app in the Azure Virtual Network.
Create an Azure Private Resolver in the cloud network.
Create an Azure Virtual Machine in the simulated on-premises network to test the DNS resolution to the web app.
Note
An Azure Virtual Network with peering is used to simulate an on-premises network for the purposes of this tutorial. In a production scenario, anExpress Routeorsite to site VPNis required to connect to the Azure Virtual Network to access the private endpoint.
The simulated network is configured with the Azure Private Resolver as the virtual network's DNS server. In a production scenario, the on-premises resources will use a local DNS server for name resolution. A conditional forwarder to the Azure Private Resolver is used on the on-premises DNS server to resolve the private endpoint DNS records. For more information about the configuration of conditional forwarders for your DNS server, see your provider's documentation.

Overview
A virtual network for the Azure Web App and simulated on-premises network is used for the resources in the tutorial. You create two virtual networks and peer them to simulate an Express Route or VPN connection between on-premises and Azure. An Azure Bastion host is deployed in the simulated on-premises network to connect to the test virtual machine. The test virtual machine is used to test the private endpoint connection to the web app and DNS resolution.
The following resources are used in this tutorial to simulate an on-premises and cloud network infrastructure:

The following procedure creates a virtual network with a resource subnet, an Azure Bastion subnet, and a Bastion host:

Create a private resolver
You create a private resolver in the virtual network where the private endpoint resides. The resolver receives DNS requests from the simulated on-premises workload. Those requests are forwarded to the Azure provided DNS. The Azure provided DNS resolves the Azure Private DNS zone for the private endpoint and return the IP address to the on-premises workload.

Note
Virtual machines in a virtual network with a bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in bastion hosted virtual networks. For more information, seeDissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
