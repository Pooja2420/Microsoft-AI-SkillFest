In this article, you use the Microsoft Entra admin center to enable single sign-on (SSO) for an enterprise application that you added to your Microsoft Entra tenant. After you configure SSO, your users can sign in by using their Microsoft Entra credentials.
Microsoft Entra ID has a gallery that contains thousands of preintegrated applications that use SSO. This article uses an enterprise application namedMicrosoft Entra SAML Toolkit 1as an example, but the concepts apply for most preconfigured enterprise applications in the Microsoft Entra application gallery.
If your application will not integrate directly with Microsoft Entra for single sign-on, and instead tokens are provided to the application by a relying party Security Token Service (STS), then see the articleEnable single sign-on for an enterprise application with a relying party security token service.
We recommend that you use a nonproduction environment to test the steps in this article.
Prerequisites
To configure SSO, you need:
A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you canCreate an account for free.
One of the following roles: Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
Completion of the steps inQuickstart: Create and assign a user account.

The process of configuring an application to use Microsoft Entra ID for SAML-based SSO varies depending on the application. For any of the enterprise applications in the gallery, use theconfiguration guidelink to find information about the steps needed to configure the application. The steps for theMicrosoft Entra SAML Toolkit 1are listed in this article.

For theMicrosoft Entra SAML Toolkit 1application in this example, the value is automatically generated once you input theSign onURL andReply URLvalues. Follow the specific configuration guide for the application you're integrating with to determine the correct value.
