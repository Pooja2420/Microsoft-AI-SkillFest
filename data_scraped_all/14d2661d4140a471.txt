TheKey Phrase Extractionskill evaluates unstructured text, and for each record, returns a list of key phrases. This skill uses theKey Phrasemachine learning models provided byAzure AI Language.
This capability is useful if you need to quickly identify the main talking points in the record. For example, given input text "The food was delicious and there were wonderful staff", the service returns "food" and "wonderful staff".
Note
This skill is bound to Azure AI services and requiresa billable resourcefor transactions that exceed 20 documents per indexer per day. Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existingAzure AI services pay-as-you go price.
@odata.type
Microsoft.Skills.Text.KeyPhraseExtractionSkill
Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured byString.Length. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using theText Split skill. If you do use a text split skill, set the page length to 5000 for the best performance.

Sample definition
Consider a SQL record that has the following fields:
{
    "content": "Glaciers are huge rivers of ice that ooze their way over land, powered by gravity and their own sheer weight. They accumulate ice from snowfall and lose it through melting. As global temperatures have risen, many of the worldâs glaciers have already started to shrink and retreat. Continued warming could see many iconic landscapes â from the Canadian Rockies to the Mount Everest region of the Himalayas â lose almost all their glaciers by the end of the century.",
    "language": "en"
}
{
    "content": "Glaciers are huge rivers of ice that ooze their way over land, powered by gravity and their own sheer weight. They accumulate ice from snowfall and lose it through melting. As global temperatures have risen, many of the worldâs glaciers have already started to shrink and retreat. Continued warming could see many iconic landscapes â from the Canadian Rockies to the Mount Everest region of the Himalayas â lose almost all their glaciers by the end of the century.",
    "language": "en"
}
Then your skill definition might look like this:
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.KeyPhraseExtractionSkill",
    "inputs": [
      {
        "name": "text",
        "source": "/document/content"
      },
      {
        "name": "languageCode",
        "source": "/document/language" 
      }
    ],
    "outputs": [
      {
        "name": "keyPhrases",
        "targetName": "myKeyPhrases"
      }
    ]
  }
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.KeyPhraseExtractionSkill",
    "inputs": [
      {
        "name": "text",
        "source": "/document/content"
      },
      {
        "name": "languageCode",
        "source": "/document/language" 
      }
    ],
    "outputs": [
      {
        "name": "keyPhrases",
        "targetName": "myKeyPhrases"
      }
    ]
  }
Sample output
For the previous example, the output of your skill is written to a new node in the enriched tree called "document/myKeyPhrases" since that is thetargetNamethat we specified. If you donât specify atargetName, then it would be "document/keyPhrases".
targetName
targetName
[
  "worldâs glaciers", 
  "huge rivers of ice", 
  "Canadian Rockies", 
  "iconic landscapes",
  "Mount Everest region",
  "Continued warming"
]
[
  "worldâs glaciers", 
  "huge rivers of ice", 
  "Canadian Rockies", 
  "iconic landscapes",
  "Mount Everest region",
  "Continued warming"
]
You can use "document/myKeyPhrases" as input into other skills, or as a source of anoutput field mapping.
Warnings
If you provide an unsupported language code, a warning is generated and key phrases aren't extracted.
If your text is empty, a warning is produced.
If your text is larger than 50,000 characters, only the first 50,000 characters are analyzed and a warning is issued.
