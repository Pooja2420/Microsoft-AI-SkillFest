Azure DevOps Services
A web app is a lightweight way to host a web application. In this step-by-step guide, learn how to create a pipeline that continuously builds and deploys a Java app. Each commit can automatically build at GitHub and deploy to an Azure App Service. You can use whatever runtime you prefer, Tomcat, or Java SE.
For more information, seeJava for Azure App Service.
Tip
If you only want to build a Java app, seeBuild Java apps.
Prerequisites
Get the code
Select the runtime you want to use.
Tomcat
Java SE
If you already have an app in GitHub that you want to deploy, you can create a pipeline for that code.
If you are a new user, fork this repo in GitHub:

Create an Azure App Service
Sign in to theAzure Portal, and then select theCloud Shellbutton in the upper-right corner.
Create an Azure App Service on Linux.
Tomcat
Java SE
# Create a resource group
az group create --location eastus2 --name myapp-rg

# Create an app service plan of type Linux
az appservice plan create -g myapp-rg -n myapp-service-plan --is-linux

# Create an App Service from the plan with Tomcat and JRE 8 as the runtime
az webapp create -g myapp-rg -p myapp-service-plan -n my-app-name --runtime "TOMCAT|8.5-jre8"
# Create a resource group
az group create --location eastus2 --name myapp-rg

# Create an app service plan of type Linux
az appservice plan create -g myapp-rg -n myapp-service-plan --is-linux

You can automatically create anAzure Resource Manager service connectionwhen you create your pipeline. To get started, select your Azure subscription where you created a resource group.

SelectValidate and configure. The new pipeline includes a new Azure Resource Manager service connection.As Azure Pipelines creates an azure-pipelines.yml file, which defines your CI/CD pipeline, it:Includes a Build stage, which builds your project, and a Deploy stage, which deploys it to Azure as a Linux web app.As part of the Deploy stage, it also creates anEnvironmentwith default name same as the Web App. You can choose to modify the environment name.

See the pipeline run, and your app deployed
As your pipeline runs, your build and deployment stages go from blue (running) to green (completed). To watch your pipeline in action, you can select stages and jobs.

Also explore deployment history for the app by going to the "environment". From the pipeline summary:
Select theEnvironmentstab.
SelectView environment.
Clean up resources
Whenever you're done with the resources you created, you can use the following command to delete them:
az group delete --name myapp-rg
az group delete --name myapp-rg
Enterywhen you're prompted.
