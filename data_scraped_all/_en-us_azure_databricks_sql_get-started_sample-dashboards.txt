This tutorial shows you how to import and use sample dashboards from the samples gallery. These dashboards illustrate some of the rich visualizations you can use to gain insights from your data. No setup is required. These dashboards use data already available in your workspace and rely on a compute resource (called a SQL warehouse) already configured. You donât need to be an administrator to get started.

SeeDashboardsto learn about all of the visualization types and features available for dashboards.
