Tutorial: Filter inbound Internet or intranet traffic with Azure Firewall policy DNAT using the Azure portal

You can configure Azure Firewall policy Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) to translate and filter inbound Internet or intranet (preview) traffic to your subnets. When you configure DNAT, therule collection actionis set toDNAT. Each rule in the NAT rule collection can then be used to translate your firewall public or private IP address and port to a private IP address and port. DNAT rules implicitly add a corresponding network rule to allow the translated traffic. For security reasons, the recommended approach is to add a specific source to allow DNAT access to the network and avoid using wildcards. To learn more about Azure Firewall rule processing logic, seeAzure Firewall rule processing logic.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Set up a test network environment
Deploy a firewall and policy
Create a default route
Configure a DNAT rule
Test the firewall
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create a resource group
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the Azure portal home page, selectResource groups, then selectAdd.
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource group name, typeRG-DNAT-Test.
ForRegion, select a region. All other resources that you create must be in the same region.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Set up the network environment
For this tutorial, you create a two peered VNets:
VN-Hub- the firewall is in this VNet.
VN-Spoke- the workload server is in this VNet.
First, create the VNets and then peer them.
Create the Hub VNet
From the Azure portal home page, selectAll services.

Accept all the other defaults, and then selectAdd.
Create a virtual machine
Create a workload virtual machine, and place it in theSN-Workloadsubnet.
From the Azure portal menu, selectCreate a resource.
UnderPopular, selectWindows Server 2016 Datacenter.
Basics
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource group, selectRG-DNAT-Test.

Review the summary, and then selectCreate. This will take a few minutes to complete.
After deployment finishes, note the private IP address for the virtual machine. It will be used later when you configure the firewall. Select the virtual machine name, and underSettings, selectNetworkingto find the private IP address.
Deploy the firewall and policy

Note the firewall's private and public IP addresses. You'll use them later when you create the default route and NAT rule.

Create a default route
For theSN-Workloadsubnet, you configure the outbound default route to go through the firewall.
Important
You do not need to configure an explicit route back to the firewall at the destination subnet. Azure Firewall is a stateful service and handles the packets and sessions automatically. If you create this route, you'll create an asymmetrical routing environment that interrupts the stateful session logic and results in dropped packets and connections.
