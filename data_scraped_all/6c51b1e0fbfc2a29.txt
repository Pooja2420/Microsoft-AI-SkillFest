Applies to: Azure Local 2311.2 and later
This article provides guidance on how to configure firewalls for the Azure Stack HCI operating system. It includes firewall requirements for outbound endpoints and internal rules and ports. The article also provides information on how to use Azure service tags with Microsoft Defender firewall.
This article also describes how to optionally use a highly locked-down firewall configuration to block all traffic to all destinations except those included in your allowlist.
If your network uses a proxy server for internet access, seeConfigure proxy settings for Azure Local.
Important
Azure Express Route and Azure Private Link are not supported for Azure Local or any of its components as it is not possible to access the public endpoints required for Azure Local.
Firewall requirements for outbound endpoints
Opening ports 80 and 443 for outbound network traffic on your organization's firewall meets the connectivity requirements for the Azure Stack HCI operating system to connect with Azure and Microsoft Update.
Azure Local needs to periodically connect to Azure for:
Well-known Azure IPs
Outbound direction
Ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
Important
Azure Local doesn't support HTTPS inspection. Make sure that HTTPS inspection is disabled along your networking path for Azure Local to prevent any connectivity errors. This includes use ofEntra IDtenant restrictions v1which is not supported for Azure Local management network communication.
As shown in the following diagram, Azure Local can access Azure using more than one firewall potentially.

Required firewall URLs for Azure Local deployments
Azure Local instances automatically enables Azure Resource Bridge and AKS infrastructure and uses the Arc for Servers agent to connect to Azure control plane. Along with the list of HCI specific endpoints on the following table, theAzure Resource Bridge on Azure Localendpoints, theAKS on Azure Localendpoints and theAzure Arc-enabled serversendpoints must be included in the allow list of your firewall.
For a consolidated list of endpoints for East US that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:
Required endpoints in East US for Azure Local
For a consolidated list of endpoints for West Europe that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:
Required endpoints in West Europe for Azure Local
For a consolidated list of endpoints for Australia East that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:
Required endpoints in Australia East for Azure Local
For a consolidated list of endpoints for Canada Central that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:

For a consolidated list of endpoints for India Central that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:

For a consolidated list of endpoints for Southeast Asia that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:
Required endpoints in Southeast Asia for Azure Local
For a consolidated list of endpoints for Japan East that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:
Required endpoints in Japan East for Azure Local
For a consolidated list of endpoints for South Central US that includes Azure Local, Arc-enabled servers, ARB, and AKS, use:

Firewall requirements for OEMs
Depending on the OEM you are using for Azure Local you may need to open additional endpoints in your firewall.

Firewall requirements for additional Azure services
Depending on additional Azure services you enable for Azure Local, you may need to make additional firewall configuration changes. Refer to the following links for information on firewall requirements for each Azure service:
Azure Monitor Agent
Azure portal
Azure Site Recovery
Azure Virtual Desktop
Microsoft Defender
Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and Log Analytics Agent
Qualys
Remote support
Windows Admin Center
Windows Admin Center in Azure portal
Firewall requirements for internal rules and ports
Ensure that the proper network ports are open between all nodes, both within a site and between sites for stretched instances (stretched instance functionality is only available in Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2). You'll need appropriate firewall rules to allow ICMP, SMB (port 445, plus port 5445 for SMB Direct if using iWARP RDMA), and WS-MAN (port 5985) bi-directional traffic between all nodes in the cluster.
When using theCreation wizardin Windows Admin Center to create the cluster, the wizard automatically opens the appropriate firewall ports on each server in the cluster for Failover Clustering, Hyper-V, and Storage Replica. If you're using a different firewall on each machine, open the ports as described in the following sections:
Azure Stack HCI OS management
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Azure Stack HCI OS management, including licensing and billing.
Windows Admin Center
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Windows Admin Center.
Note
While installing Windows Admin Center, if you select theUse WinRM over HTTPS onlysetting, then port 5986 is required.
Active Directory
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Active Directory (local security authority).
Network Time Protocol
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Network Time Protocol (NTP).
Failover Clustering
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Failover Clustering.
Note
The management system includes any computer from which you plan to administer the system, using tools such as Windows Admin Center, Windows PowerShell, or System Center Virtual Machine Manager.
Hyper-V
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Hyper-V.
Note
Open up a range of ports above port 5000 to allow RPC dynamic port allocation. Ports below 5000 may already be in use by other applications and could cause conflicts with DCOM applications. Previous experience shows that a minimum of 100 ports should be opened, because several system services rely on these RPC ports to communicate with each other. For more information, seeHow to configure RPC dynamic port allocation to work with firewalls.
Storage Replica (stretched cluster)
Ensure that the following firewall rules are configured in your on-premises firewall for Storage Replica (stretched instance).

Update Microsoft Defender firewall
This section shows how to configure Microsoft Defender firewall to allow IP addresses associated with a service tag to connect with the operating system. Aservice tagrepresents a group of IP addresses from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the IP addresses included in the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as IP addresses change to keep updates to a minimum. To learn more, seeVirtual network service tags.
