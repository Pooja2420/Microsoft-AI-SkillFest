Create pull requests (PRs) to change, review, and merge code in aGit repository. You can create PRs from branches in the upstream repository or from branches in yourforkof the repository. Your team canreview the PRsand give feedback on changes. Reviewers can step through the proposed changes, leave comments, and vote to approve or reject the PRs. Depending onbranch policiesand other requirements, your PR might need to meet various criteria before you cancomplete the PRand merge the changes into the target branch.
For PR guidelines and management considerations, seeAbout pull requests.

Example
The following command creates a PR from thenewbranch to the defaultmainbranch of the Fabrikam repository, opens the PR in the browser, and shows the command output in a table. The example uses the default configuration:az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamprime project="Fabrikam Fiber".
new

az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamprime project="Fabrikam Fiber"

You can add many other PR details at or after PR creation. To add details, reviewers, work items, and completion options to the PR, seeAdd details or edit PRs.
Azure DevOps CLI commands aren't supported for Azure DevOps Server.
Add updates with cherry-pick
You can copy commits from one branch to another by using cherry-pick. Unlike a merge or rebase, cherry-pick only brings the changes from the commits you select, instead of all the changes in a branch.
To cherry-pick changes from a completed PR, selectCherry-pickon the PR'sOverviewpage. To copy changes from an active PR, selectCherry-pickfrom the PR'sMore optionsmenu. This action creates a new branch with the copied changes. You can then create a new PR from the new branch. For detailed instructions, seeCopy changes with cherry-pick.
Switch source and target branches of your pull request
Before the first time you save a PR, you can switch the source and target branches of the PR by selecting theSwitch source and target branchesicon next to the branch names. Once the PR is active, this icon goes away, but you can stillchange the target branchof the PR.

Use pull request templates
A pull request template is a file containing Markdown text that populates the PR description when you create a PR. Good PR descriptions tell PR reviewers what to expect, and can help track tasks like adding unit tests and updating documentation. Your team can create a default PR template that adds text to all new PR descriptions in the repo. Also, you can select from branch-specific templates or other templates your team defines. For more information about creating and using PR templates, seeImprove pull request descriptions using templates.
If your repo has a default template, all PRs in the repo have the default template's description text at creation. To add other templates, selectAdd a templateand then choose a template from the dropdown list. You can edit the template text in your description, remove it, or add other text.


Create draft PRs
If your PR isn't ready for review, you can create a draft PR to indicate work in progress. When the PR is ready for review, you can publish it, and begin or resume the full review process.
Draft PRs have the following differences from published PRs:
Build validation policies don't run automatically. You can queue build validations manually by selecting the more options menu in the PR.

When you're ready to have the PR reviewed and completed, selectPublishat upper right in the PR. Publishing a PR assigns required reviewers, evaluates policies, and kicks off voting.

To change an existing published PR to a draft, chooseMark as draft. Marking a PR as draft removes all existing votes.

To set a PR to draft, open the PR and selectMark as draft.
To open a pull request from Visual Studio, in theGitmenu, select<your Git service>>View Pull Requests, and select a pull request to open it.

For example:
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --draft true
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --draft true
To set an existing PR to draft, useaz repos pr update --id <PR Id> --draft true.

When you're ready to have your changes reviewed, selectCreateto create the PR.


Don't worry if you don't have all of the work items, reviewers, or details ready when you create your PR. You can add or update these items after you create the PR.
Edit PR title and description
Keep the PR title and description up to date so reviewers can understand the changes in the PR.
You can update the title of an existing PR by selecting the current title and updating the text. Select theSaveicon to save changes, or select theUndoicon to discard the changes.

You can add details during PR creation withaz repos pr create, or update details in existing PRs withaz repos pr update.
When you create a PR withaz repos pr create, add a--titleand a detailed--descriptionof your changes so others can see what problems the changes solve. The--descriptionparameter accepts Markdown entry, and each value in the argument is a new line of the PR description.

Remove a work item link by selecting thexicon next to the work item. Removing a link only removes the link between the work item and the PR. Links created in the branch or from commits remain in the work item.
To link work items, open the PR in your browser, and then make your updates on the PR'sOverviewpage.

You can link Azure Boards work items to PRs at PR creation withaz repos pr create --work-items <Id1> <Id2>, where <Id> is the work item's ID.
az repos pr create --work-items <Id1> <Id2>
For example, the following command links work items #63 and #64 to a new PR in thenewbranch:
new
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --work-items 63 64
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --work-items 63 64
To manage work items for an existing PR, useaz repos pr work-item.
To link work items to an existing PR, useaz repos pr work-item add --id <PR Id> --work-items <Id1> <Id2>.
az repos pr work-item add --id <PR Id> --work-items <Id1> <Id2>
To list the work items linked to a PR, useaz repos pr work-item list --id <PR Id>.
az repos pr work-item list --id <PR Id>
To unlink a work item from a PR, useaz repos pr work-item remove --id <PR Id> --work-items <Id1>.
Unlinking only removes the link between the work item and the PR. Links created in the branch or from commits stay in the work item.
az repos pr work-item remove --id <PR Id> --work-items <Id1>
az repos pr work-item add --id

Add tags to a pull request
Use tags to show important details and help organize PRs. Tags can communicate extra information to reviewers, such as that the PR is still a work in progress, or is a hotfix for an upcoming release.

To add a tag when creating a PR, type a tag name in theTagssection. After you create the PR, you can manage tags in theTagssection.

Add attachments to pull requests
You can attach files, including images, to your PR during or after creation. Select the paper clip icon below theDescriptionfield, or drag and drop files directly into theDescriptionfield of the PR.


Change the target branch of an active pull request
For most teams, nearly all PRs target a default branch, such asmainordevelop. If you sometimes need to target a different branch, it's easy to forget to change the target branch when you create the PR. If that happens, you can change the target branch of an active PR:
main
develop
SelectMore actionsat upper-right on the PROverviewpage, and then selectChange target branchfrom the dropdown menu.
In theChange target branchpane, selectChoose a target branch, select the new branch, and then selectChange.
Send email pull request notifications to stakeholders
You can share a pull request by email to notify reviewers and communicate with team members. To share a PR:
SelectMore optionson the PROverviewpage, and then selectShare pull request.
SelectMore optionson the PROverviewpage, and then selectShare pull request.

On theShare pull requestscreen, add recipients by typing their names in theTo:field and selecting from the user names that appear. You can also remove recipients.
On theShare pull requestscreen, add recipients by typing their names in theTo:field and selecting from the user names that appear. You can also remove recipients.

Add an optional message in theNote (Optional)field, and then selectSend. Recipients receive an email requesting their attention and linking to the PR.
Note
When using the built-in email feature, you can only send emails to individual project members' addresses. Adding a team group or security group to theTo:line isn't supported. If you add an unrecognized email address, you receive a message indicating that one or more recipients don't have permissions to read the mailed pull request.
For the email feature to work, your administrator mustconfigure an SMTP server.
