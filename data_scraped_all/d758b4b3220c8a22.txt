This article shows you how to create and manage system topics using the Azure portal. For an overview of system topics, seeSystem topics.
Create a system topic
You can create a system topic for an Azure resource (Storage account, Event Hubs namespace, etc.) in two ways:
Using theEventspage of a resource, for example, Storage Account or Event Hubs Namespace. Event Grid automatically creates a system topic for you in this case.When you use theEventspage in the Azure portal to create an event subscription for an event raised by an Azure source (for example: Azure Storage account), the portal creates a system topic for the Azure resource and then creates a subscription for the system topic. You specify the name of the system topic if you're creating an event subscription on the Azure resource for the first time. From the second time onwards, the system topic name is displayed for you in the read-only mode. SeeQuickstart: Route Blob storage events to web endpoint with the Azure portalfor detailed steps.
