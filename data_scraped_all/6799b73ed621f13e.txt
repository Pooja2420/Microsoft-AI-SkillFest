Azure Disk Storage allows you to manage your own keys when using server-side encryption (SSE) for managed disks, if you choose. For conceptual information on SSE with customer managed keys, and other managed disk encryption types, see theCustomer-managed keyssection of our disk encryption article:Customer-managed keys
Prerequisites
Restrictions
For now, customer-managed keys have the following restrictions:
If this feature is enabled for a disk with incremental snapshots, it can't be disabled on that disk or its snapshots.
To work around this, copy all the data to an entirely different managed disk that isn't using customer-managed keys. You can do that with either theAzure CLIor theAzure PowerShell module.
A disk and all of its associated incremental snapshots must have the same disk encryption set.
Onlysoftware and HSM RSA keysof sizes 2,048-bit, 3,072-bit and 4,096-bit are supported, no other keys or sizes.HSMkeys require thepremiumtier of Azure Key vaults.

Most resources related to your customer-managed keys (disk encryption sets, VMs, disks, and snapshots) must be in the same subscription and region.Azure Key Vaults may be used from a different subscription but must be in the same region as your disk encryption set. As a preview, you can use Azure Key Vaults fromdifferent Microsoft Entra tenants.

Disks encrypted with customer-managed keys can only move to another resource group if the VM they are attached to is deallocated.
Disks, snapshots, and images encrypted with customer-managed keys can't be moved between subscriptions.
Managed disks currently or previously encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption can't be encrypted using customer-managed keys.
Can only create up to 5000 disk encryption sets per region per subscription.
For information about using customer-managed keys with shared image galleries, seePreview: Use customer-managed keys for encrypting images.
The following sections cover how to enable and use customer-managed keys for managed disks:
Setting up customer-managed keys for your disks requires you to create resources in a particular order, if you're doing it for the first time. First, you'll need to create and set up an Azure Key Vault.

Enter a key vault name, select a region, and select a pricing tier.NoteWhen creating the Key Vault instance, you must enable soft delete and purge protection. Soft delete ensures that the Key Vault holds a deleted key for a given retention period (90 day default). Purge protection ensures that a deleted key cannot be permanently deleted until the retention period lapses. These settings protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks.

Deploy a VM
Now that you've created and set up your key vault and the disk encryption set, you can deploy a VM using the encryption.
The VM deployment process is similar to the standard deployment process, the only differences are that you need to deploy the VM in the same region as your other resources and you opt to use a customer managed key.

Important
Customer-managed keys rely on managed identities for Azure resources, a feature of Microsoft Entra ID. When you configure customer-managed keys, a managed identity is automatically assigned to your resources under the covers. If you subsequently move the subscription, resource group, or managed disk from one Microsoft Entra directory to another, the managed identity associated with the managed disks is not transferred to the new tenant, so customer-managed keys may no longer work. For more information, seeTransferring a subscription between Microsoft Entra directories.
