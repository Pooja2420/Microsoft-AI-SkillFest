Application Gateway publishes data points toAzure Monitorfor the performance of your Application Gateway and backend instances. These data points are called metrics, and are numerical values in an ordered set of time-series data. Metrics describe some aspect of your application gateway at a particular time. If there are requests flowing through the Application Gateway, it measures and sends its metrics in 60-second intervals. If there are no requests flowing through the Application Gateway or no data for a metric, the metric isn't reported. For more information, seeAzure Monitor metrics.

Metrics supported by Application Gateway V2 SKU

Timing metrics
Application Gateway provides several builtâin timing metrics related to the request and response, which are all measured in milliseconds.

Note
If there is more than one listener in the Application Gateway, then always filter byListenerdimension while comparing different latency metrics in order to get meaningful inference.
Note
Latency might be observed in the metric data, as all metrics are aggregated at one-minute intervals. This latency may vary for different application gateway instances based on the metric start time.
You can use timing metrics to determine whether the observed slowdown is due to the client network, Application Gateway performance, the backend network and backend server TCP stack saturation, backend application performance, or large file size. For more information, seeTiming metrics.
For example, if there's a spike inBackend first byte response timetrend but theBackend connect timetrend is stable, you can infer that the application gateway to backend latency and the time taken to establish the connection is stable. The spike is caused due to an increase in the response time of backend application. On the other hand, if the spike inBackend first byte response timeis associated with a corresponding spike inBackend connect time, you can deduce that either the network between Application Gateway and backend server or the backend server TCP stack has saturated.
If you notice a spike inBackend last byte response timebut theBackend first byte response timeis stable, you can deduce that the spike is because of a larger file being requested.
Similarly, if theApplication gateway total timehas a spike but theBackend last byte response timeis stable, then it can either be a sign of performance bottleneck at the Application Gateway or a bottleneck in the network between client and Application Gateway. Additionally, if theclient RTTalso has a corresponding spike, then it indicates that the degradation is because of the network between client and Application Gateway.
Application Gateway metrics
For Application Gateway, there are several metrics available. For a list, seeApplication Gateway metrics.

Metrics visualization
Browse to an application gateway, underMonitoringselectMetrics. To view the available values, select theMETRICdrop-down list.
In the following image, you see an example with three metrics displayed for the last 30 minutes:

Alert rules on metrics
You can start alert rules based on metrics for a resource. For example, an alert can call a webhook or email an administrator if the throughput of the application gateway is above, below, or at a threshold for a specified period.
The following example walks you through creating an alert rule that sends an email to an administrator after throughput breaches a threshold:
selectAdd metric alertto open theAdd rulepage. You can also reach this page from the metrics page.
selectAdd metric alertto open theAdd rulepage. You can also reach this page from the metrics page.

On theAdd rulepage, fill out the name, condition, and notify sections, and selectOK.In theConditionselector, select one of the four values:Greater than,Greater than or equal,Less than, orLess than or equal to.In thePeriodselector, select a period from five minutes to six hours.If you selectEmail owners, contributors, and readers, the email can be dynamic, based on the users who have access to that resource. Otherwise, you can provide a comma-separated list of users in theAdditional administrator email(s)box.

If the threshold is breached, an email that's similar to the one in the following image arrives:

A list of alerts appears after you create a metric alert. It provides an overview of all the alert rules.
