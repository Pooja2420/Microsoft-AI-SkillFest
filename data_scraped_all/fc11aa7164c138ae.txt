In this quickstart, you learn how to connect to VMs with the Azure Bastion Developer offering. In just a few seconds, you can connect to virtual machines (VM) in the virtual network at no extra cost via Bastion Developer using the private IP address of the VM. The VMs you connect to don't need a public IP address, client software, agent, or a special configuration. For more information about Azure Bastion, seeWhat is Azure Bastion?
The following diagram shows the architecture for Azure Bastion Developer.

About Bastion Developer
Bastion Developer is a free, lightweight offering of the Azure Bastion service. This offering is ideal for Dev/Test users who want to securely connect to their VMs, but don't need additional Bastion features or host scaling. With Bastion Developer, you can connect to one Azure VM at a time directly through the virtual machine connect page.
When you connect with Bastion Developer, the deployment requirements are different than when you deploy using other SKUs. Typically when you create a bastion host, a host is deployed to the AzureBastionSubnet in your virtual network. The Bastion host is dedicated for your use, whereas Bastion Developer isn't. Because the Bastion Developer resource isn't dedicated, the features for Bastion Developer are limited. You can always upgrade Bastion Developer to a specificSKUif you need to support more features. SeeUpgrade a SKU.
Prerequisites
Verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate yourMSDN subscriber benefitsor sign up for afree account.

A VM in a virtual network.When you connect with Bastion Developer using default values, the values are pulled from the virtual network in which your VM resides. Make sure the VM resides in a resource group that's in a region where Bastion Developer is supported.If you don't already have a VM in a virtual network, create one usingQuickstart: Create a Windows VM, orQuickstart: Create a Linux VM.If you need example values, see theExample valuessection.If you already have a virtual network, make sure it's selected on the Networking tab when you create your VM.If you don't have a virtual network, you can create one at the same time you create your VM.If you have a virtual network, make sure you have the rights to write to it.

The use of Azure Bastion with Azure Private DNS zones is supported. However, there are restrictions. For more information, see theAzure Bastion FAQ.
Example values
You can use the following example values when creating this configuration as an exercise, or you can substitute your own.
Basic VNet and VM values:
Deploy Bastion and connect to VM
These steps help you automatically connect to your VM via the portal with Bastion Developer. The VM must be located in a region that supports Bastion Developer. Additionally, to connect to a VM, your NSG rules must allow traffic to ports 22 and 3389 from the private IP address 168.63.129.16.

On theBastionpage, you'll see multiple options, including dedicated SKUs and BastionDeveloper. To automatically deploy using the Bastion Developer offering, selectAuthentication Typeand input the required credential values. Then, clickConnectto connect to your virtual machine in just a few seconds through Bastion Developer. When you clickConnect, a free Bastion Developer resource automatically deploys to your virtual network. You could also deploy Bastion Developer using the "Configure manually" button, but it's more efficient to use theConnectbutton.

The connection to this virtual machine via Bastion Developer will open directly in the Azure portal (over HTML5) using port 443 and the Bastion service. SelectAllowwhen asked for permissions to the clipboard. This lets you use the remote clipboard arrows on the left of the screen.When you connect, the desktop of the VM might look different than the example screenshot.Using keyboard shortcut keys while connected to a VM might not result in the same behavior as shortcut keys on a local computer. For example, when connected to a Windows VM from a Windows client, CTRL+ALT+END is the keyboard shortcut for CTRL+ALT+Delete on a local computer. To do this from a Mac while connected to a Windows VM, the keyboard shortcut is Fn+CTRL+ALT+Backspace.

When you disconnect from the VM, the Bastion Developer resource remains deployed to the virtual network. You can reconnect to the VM from the virtual machine page in the Azure portal by selectingBastion -> Connect.

To enable audio output
You can enable remote audio output for your VM. Some VMs automatically enable this setting, whereas others require you to enable audio settings manually. The settings are changed on the VM itself. Your Bastion deployment doesn't need any special configuration settings to enable remote audio output. Audio input is not supported at the moment.
Note
Audio output uses bandwidth on your internet connection.
To enable remote audio output on a Windows VM:
After you're connected to the VM, an audio button appears on the lower-right corner of the toolbar. Right-click the audio button, and then selectSounds.
A pop-up message asks if you want to enable the Windows Audio Service. SelectYes. You can configure more audio options inSound preferences.
To verify sound output, hover over the audio button on the toolbar.
Remove VM public IP address
When you connect to a VM by using Azure Bastion, you don't need a public IP address for your VM. If you aren't using the public IP address for anything else, you can dissociate it from your VM:
Go to your virtual machine. On theOverviewpage, click thePublic IP addressto open the Public IP address page.
Go to your virtual machine. On theOverviewpage, click thePublic IP addressto open the Public IP address page.
On thePublic IP addresspage, go toOverview. You can view the resource that this IP address isAssociated to. SelectDissociateat the top of the pane.
On thePublic IP addresspage, go toOverview. You can view the resource that this IP address isAssociated to. SelectDissociateat the top of the pane.
SelectYesto dissociate the IP address from the VM network interface. After you dissociate the public IP address from the network interface, verify that it's no longer listed underAssociated to.
