The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.Azure Policysupports auditing the state of your Azure Arc-enabled server with machine configuration policies. Azure Policy's machine configuration definitions can audit or apply settings inside the machine.
This tutorial steps you through the process of creating and assigning a policy in order to identify which of your Azure Arc-enabled servers don't haveMicrosoft Defender for Serversenabled.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
Create policy assignment and assign a definition to it
Identify resources that aren't compliant with the new policy
Remove the policy from non-compliant resources
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afreeaccount
before you begin.
Create a policy assignment
Use the following procedure to create a policy assignment and assign the policy definitionAzure Defender for servers should be enabled.
Launch the Azure Policy service in the Azure portal by searching for and selectingPolicy.

In the service menu, underAuthoring, selectAssignments. An assignment is a policy assigned to take place within a specific scope.

On theAssign Policypage, select theScopeby selecting the ellipsis and selecting either a management group or subscription. Optionally, select a resource group. The scope determines which resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets enforced on. Then, chooseSelectat the bottom of theScopepane.

You're now ready to identify non-compliant resources to understand the compliance state of your environment.
Identify non-compliant resources
In the service menu, selectCompliance. Then locate theAzure Defender for servers should be enabledpolicy assignment you created.

If there are any existing resources that aren't compliant with this new assignment, they appear
underNon-compliant resources.
When a condition is evaluated against your existing resources and found true, those resources
are marked as non-compliant with the policy. The following table shows how different policy effects
work with the condition evaluation for the resulting compliance state. Although you don't see the
evaluation logic in the Azure portal, the compliance state results are shown. The compliance state
result is either compliant or non-compliant.
* The Append, DeployIfNotExist, and AuditIfNotExist effects require the IF statement to be TRUE.
The effects also require the existence condition to be FALSE to be non-compliant. When TRUE, the IF
condition triggers evaluation of the existence condition for the related resources.
Clean up resources
To remove the assignment created, follow these steps:
In the service menu, selectCompliance(or selectAssignmentsunderAuthoring).
Locate theAzure Defender for servers should be enabledpolicy assignment you created.
Right-click the policy assignment, then selectDelete assignment.
Next steps
In this tutorial, you assigned a policy definition to a scope and evaluated its compliance report. The policy definition validates that all the resources in the scope are compliant and identifies which ones aren't. Now you're ready to monitor your Azure Arc-enabled servers machine by enablingVM insights.
