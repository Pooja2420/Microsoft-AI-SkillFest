The selected content in the wiki page is replaced with the embedded work item.
Note
Only Markdown plain text, including bold and italics, get replaced in the wiki page. For the rest of the content like images, code blocks, and videos, the work item gets created, but the embed must be done manually. This process is to prevent the page from breaking due to the replaced work item. For more information, seeLink to work items from a Wiki page.
Show work item status
The status, ID, and title of an embedded work item is shown in the wiki page. Work item references in pull request comments and Boards discussions also show the status.
