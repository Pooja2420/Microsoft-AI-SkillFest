An Azure AI Custom Translator model provides translations for a specific language pair. The outcome of a successful training is a model. To train a custom model, three mutually exclusive document types are required: training, tuning, and testing. If only training data is provided when queuing a training, Custom Translator automatically assembles tuning and testing data. It uses a random subset of sentences from your training documents, and exclude these sentences from the training data itself. A minimum of 10,000 parallel training sentences are required to train a full model.

When to select dictionary-only training
For better results, we recommended letting the system learn from your training data. However, when you don't have enough parallel sentences to meet the 10,000 minimum requirements, or sentences and compound nouns must be rendered as-is, use dictionary-only training. Your model typically completes training faster than with full training. The resulting models use the baseline models for translation along with the dictionaries you added. You don't seeBLEUscores or get a test report.

Note
Custom Translator doesn't sentence-align dictionary files. Therefore, it is important that there are an equal number of source and target phrases/sentences in your dictionary documents and that they are precisely aligned. If not, the document upload will fail.
