Parameters
string
string
*
Returns
Returns a row in the table that maximizes the specified expressionExprToMaximize, and the values of columns specified inExprToReturn.
Tip
To see the maximal value only, use themax() function.
Examples
Find maximum latitude
The following example finds the maximum latitude of a storm event in each state.
Run the query
StormEvents 
| summarize arg_max(BeginLat, BeginLocation) by State
StormEvents 
| summarize arg_max(BeginLat, BeginLocation) by State
Output
The results table displays only the first 10 rows.
Find last state fatal event
The following example finds the last time an event with a direct death happened in each state, showing all the columns.
The query first filters the events to include only those events where there was at least one direct death. Then the query returns the entire row with the most recentStartTime.
StartTime
Run the query
StormEvents
| where DeathsDirect > 0
| summarize arg_max(StartTime, *) by State
StormEvents
| where DeathsDirect > 0
| summarize arg_max(StartTime, *) by State
Output
The results table displays only the first 10 rows and first three columns.
Handle nulls
The following example demonstrates null handling.
Run the query
datatable(Fruit: string, Color: string, Version: int) [
    "Apple", "Red", 1,
    "Apple", "Green", int(null),
    "Banana", "Yellow", int(null),
    "Banana", "Green", int(null),
    "Pear", "Brown", 1,
    "Pear", "Green", 2,
]
| summarize arg_max(Version, *) by Fruit
datatable(Fruit: string, Color: string, Version: int) [
    "Apple", "Red", 1,
    "Apple", "Green", int(null),
    "Banana", "Yellow", int(null),
    "Banana", "Green", int(null),
    "Pear", "Brown", 1,
    "Pear", "Green", 2,
]
| summarize arg_max(Version, *) by Fruit
Output
Comparison to max()
The arg_max() function differs from themax() function. The arg_max() function allows you to return other columns along with the maximum value, andmax()only returns the maximum value itself.
Examples
Find the last time an event with a direct death happened, showing all the columns in the table.
The query first filters the events to only include events where there was at least one direct death. Then the query returns the entire row with the most recent (maximum) StartTime.
Run the query
StormEvents
| where DeathsDirect > 0
| summarize arg_max(StartTime, *)
StormEvents
| where DeathsDirect > 0
| summarize arg_max(StartTime, *)
The results table returns all the columns for the row containing the highest value in the expression specified.
Find the last time an event with a direct death happened.
The query filters events to only include events where there is at least one direct death, and then returns the maximum value for StartTime.
Run the query
StormEvents
| where DeathsDirect > 0
| summarize max(StartTime)
StormEvents
| where DeathsDirect > 0
| summarize max(StartTime)
The results table returns the maximum value of StartTime, without returning other columns for this record.
