Manage your Azure subscriptions at scale with management groups

If your organization has many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access,
policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope
above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers calledmanagement groupsand apply
your governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group
automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.
Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale no matter what type of
subscription you have. To learn more about management groups, seeOrganize your resources with Azure management groups.

Important
Azure Resource Manager user tokens and management group cache last for 30 minutes before they're
forced to refresh. Any action like moving a management group or subscription might
take up to 30 minutes to appear. To see the updates sooner, you need to update your token by
refreshing the browser, signing in and out, or requesting a new token.
For the Azure PowerShell actions in this article, keep in mind thatAzManagementGroup-related cmdlets mention that-GroupIdis an alias of the-GroupNameparameter.
You can use either of them to provide the management group ID as a string value.
AzManagementGroup
-GroupId
-GroupName

Update-AzManagementGroup -GroupId 'ContosoIt' -DisplayName 'Contoso Group'
Update-AzManagementGroup -GroupId 'ContosoIt' -DisplayName 'Contoso Group'
Change the name in the Azure CLI
For the Azure CLI, use theupdatecommand:

Move management groups and subscriptions
One reason to create a management group is to bundle subscriptions together. Only management groups
and subscriptions can become children of another management group. A subscription that moves to a
management group inherits all user access and policies from the parent management group.
You can move subscriptions between management groups. A subscription can have only one parent management group.
When you move a management group or subscription to be a child of another management group, three
rules need to be evaluated as true.
If you're doing the move action, you need permission at each of the following layers:
Child subscription or management groupMicrosoft.management/managementgroups/writeMicrosoft.management/managementgroups/subscriptions/write(only for subscriptions)Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writeMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/deleteMicrosoft.Management/register/action
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/write
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/write
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/subscriptions/write(only for subscriptions)
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/subscriptions/write
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete
Microsoft.Management/register/action
Microsoft.Management/register/action
Target parent management groupMicrosoft.management/managementgroups/write
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/write
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/write
Current parent management groupMicrosoft.management/managementgroups/write
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/write
Microsoft.management/managementgroups/write
There's an exception: if the target or the existing parent management group is the root management group,
the permission requirements don't apply. Because the root management group is the default landing
spot for all new management groups and subscriptions, you don't need permissions on it to move an
item.
If the Owner role on the subscription is inherited from the current management group, your move
targets are limited. You can move the subscription only to another management group where you have
the Owner role. You can't move the subscription to a management group where you're only a
Contributor because you would lose ownership of the subscription. If you're directly assigned to the
Owner role for the subscription, you can move it to any management group where you have the Contributor role.
To see what permissions you have in the Azure portal, select the management group and then selectIAM. To learn more about Azure roles, seeWhat is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?.

template and deploy it at thetenant level:
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-08-01/managementGroupDeploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",

            }
        }
    },

            "apiVersion": "2020-05-01",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('targetMgId'), '/', parameters('subscriptionId'))]",
            "properties": {

Move a management group in Azure PowerShell
To move a management group under a different
group, use theUpdate-AzManagementGroupcommand in Azure PowerShell:
Update-AzManagementGroup
$parentGroup = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupId ContosoIT
Update-AzManagementGroup -GroupId 'Contoso' -ParentId $parentGroup.id
$parentGroup = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupId ContosoIT
Update-AzManagementGroup -GroupId 'Contoso' -ParentId $parentGroup.id
Move a management group in the Azure CLI
To move a management group in the Azure CLI, use theupdatecommand:
update
az account management-group update --name 'Contoso' --parent ContosoIT
az account management-group update --name 'Contoso' --parent ContosoIT
Audit management groups by using activity logs
Management groups are supported inAzure Monitor activity logs. You can query all
events that happen to a management group in the same central location as other Azure resources. For
example, you can see all role assignments or policy assignment changes made to a particular
management group.

When you want to query on management groups outside the Azure portal, the target scope for
management groups looks like"/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{yourMgID}".
"/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{yourMgID}"
Reference management groups from other resource providers
When you're referencing management groups from another resource provider's actions, use the following path as
the scope. This path applies when you're using Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and REST APIs.
/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{yourMgID}
/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{yourMgID}
An example of using this path is when you're assigning a new role to a management group in
Azure PowerShell:
New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/Contoso"
New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/Contoso"
You use the same scope path to retrieve a policy definition for a management group:
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/MyManagementGroup/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/ResourceNaming?api-version=2019-09-01
GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/MyManagementGroup/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/ResourceNaming?api-version=2019-09-01
