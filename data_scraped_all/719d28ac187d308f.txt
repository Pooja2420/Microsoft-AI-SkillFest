Wrap your search term into wildcard operators to get those search results which contain the term as a substring. For example: if you usetestas a search term, you will get mytestclass, test_wikiarticle as search results. You can use wildcard as a prefix or suffix or both at the same time, and that will work across all searchable entities of Azure DevOps: Code, Work items, Wiki and Packages.
