AI is a technology that enables machines to imitate intelligent human behavior. Machines can use AI to:
Analyze data to create images and videos.
Analyze and synthesize speech.
Verbally interact in natural ways.
Make predictions and generate new data.
You can incorporate AI into applications to perform functions or make decisions that traditional logic or processing can't handle effectively. As an architect that designs solutions, it's important to understand the AI and machine learning landscape and how you can integrate Azure solutions into your workload design.
Get started
Azure Architecture Center provides example architectures, architecture guides, architectural baselines, and ideas that you can apply to your scenario. Workloads that involve AI and machine learning components should follow the Azure Well-Architected FrameworkAI workloadsguidance. This guidance includes principles and design guides that influence the AI and machine learning workload across the five architecture pillars. You should implement those recommendations in the scenarios and content in the Azure Architecture Center.
AI concepts
AI concepts encompass a wide range of technologies and methodologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. The following sections provide an overview of key AI concepts.
Algorithms
Algorithmsormachine learning algorithmsare pieces of code that help people explore, analyze, and find meaning in complex datasets. Each algorithm is a finite set of unambiguous step-by-step instructions that a machine can follow to achieve a specific goal. The goal of a machine learning model is to establish or discover patterns that humans can use to make predictions or categorize information. An algorithm might describe how to determine whether a pet is a cat, dog, fish, bird, or lizard. Another far more complicated algorithm might describe how to identify a written or spoken language, analyze its words, translate them into a different language, and then check the translation for accuracy.
Choose an algorithm family that best suits your task. Evaluate the various algorithms within the family to find the appropriate fit for your workload. For more information, seeWhat are machine learning algorithms?.
Machine learning
Machine learningis an AI technique that uses algorithms to create predictive models. These algorithms parse data fields and "learn" from the patterns within data to generate models. The models can then make informed predictions or decisions based on new data.
The predictive models are validated against known data, measured by performance metrics for specific business scenarios, and then adjusted as needed. This process of learning and validation is calledtraining. Through periodic retraining, machine learning models improve over time.
In your workload design, you might use machine learning if your scenario includes past observations that you can reliably use to predict future situations. These observations can be universal truths, such as computer vision that detects one form of animal from another. Or these observations can be specific to your situation, such as computer vision that detects a potential assembly mistake on your assembly lines based on past warranty claim data.
For more information, seeWhat is machine learning?.
Deep learning
Deep learningis a type of machine learning that can learn through its own data processing. Like machine learning, it also uses algorithms to analyze data. But it analyzes data through artificial neural networks that contain many inputs, outputs, and layers of processing. Each layer can process the data in a different way. The output of one layer becomes the input for the next. This process enables deep learning to create more complex models than traditional machine learning.
Deep learning requires a large investment to generate highly customized or exploratory models. You might consider other solutions in this article before you add deep learning to your workload.
For more information, seeWhat is deep learning?.
Generative AI
Generative AItrains models to generate original content based on many forms of content, such as natural language, computer vision, audio, or image input. With generative AI, you can describe a desired output in everyday language, and the model can respond by creating appropriate text, image, and code. Examples of generative AI applications include Microsoft Copilot and Azure OpenAI Service.
Copilotis primarily a user interface that helps you write code, documents, and other text-based content. It's based on popular OpenAI models and is integrated into a wide range of Microsoft applications and user experiences.

Azure OpenAIis a development platform as a service that provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models, such as o1-preview, o1-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and the Embeddings model series. You can adapt these models to your specific tasks, such as:Content generation.Content summarization.Image understanding.Semantic search.Natural language to code translation.

Language models
Language modelsare a subset of generative AI that focus on natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and sentiment analysis. These models represent natural language based on the probability of words or sequences of words occurring in a given context.
Conventional language models are used in supervised settings for research purposes where the models are trained on well-labeled text datasets for specific tasks. Pretrained language models offer an accessible way to get started with AI. They're more widely used in recent years. These models are trained on large-scale text collections from the internet via deep learning neural networks. You can fine-tune them on smaller datasets for specific tasks.
The number of parameters, or weights, determine the size of a language model. Parameters influence how the model processes input data and generates output. During training, the model adjusts the weights to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual data. This process is how the model learns parameters. The more parameters a model has, the more complex and expressive it is. But it's also more computationally expensive to train and use.
In general, small language models generally have fewer than 10 billion parameters, and large language models have more than 10 billion parameters. For example, the Microsoft Phi-3 model family has three versions:
Mini, 3.8 billion parameters
Small, 7 billion parameters
Medium, 14 billion parameters
For more information, seeLanguage model catalog.
Copilots
The availability of language models led to the emergence of new ways to interact with applications and systems through digital copilots and connected, domain-specific agents.Copilotsare generative AI assistants that integrate into applications, often as chat interfaces. They provide contextualized support for common tasks in those applications.
Microsoft Copilotintegrates with a wide range of Microsoft applications and user experiences. It's based on an open architecture where non-Microsoft developers can create their own plug-ins to extend or customize the user experience with Copilot. Partner developers can also create their own copilots by using the same open architecture.
For more information, see the following resources:
Adopt, extend, and build Copilot experiences across the Microsoft Cloud

Retrieval Augmented Generation
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)is an architecture pattern that augments the capabilities of a large language model (LLM), like ChatGPT, that's trained only on public data. You can use this pattern to add a retrieval system that provides relevant grounding data in the context with the user request. An information retrieval system provides control over grounding data that a language model uses when it formulates a response. RAG architecture helps you scope generative AI to content that's sourced from vectorized documents, images, and other data formats. RAG isn't limited to vector search storage. You can use any data store technology.
For more information, seeDesign and develop a RAG solutionandChoose an Azure service for vector search.
Azure AI services
WithAzure AI services, developers and organizations can use ready-made, prebuilt, and customizable APIs and models to create intelligent, market-ready, and responsible applications. Use cases include natural language processing for conversations, search, monitoring, translation, speech, vision, and decision-making.

AI language models
LLMs, such as the OpenAI GPT models, are powerful tools that can generate natural language across various domains and tasks. To choose a model, consider factors such as data privacy, ethical use, accuracy, and bias.
Phi open modelsare small, less compute-intensive models for generative AI solutions. A small language model might be more efficient, interpretable, and explainable than an LLM.
When you design a workload, you can use language models as a hosted solution behind a metered API. Alternatively, for many small language models, you can host language models in-process or at least on the same compute as the consumer. When you use language models in your solution, consider your choice of language model and its available hosting options to help ensure an optimized solution for your use case.

Typically, the features that best characterize the patterns in the data are selected to create predictive models.
Although you can use many of the raw data fields to train a model, you might need to create other engineered features that provide information to better differentiate patterns in the data. This process is called feature engineering, where you use domain knowledge of the data to create features that help machine learning algorithms learn better.
In Machine Learning, data-scaling and normalization techniques are applied to make feature engineering easier. Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are calledfeaturizationin AutoML experiments. For more information, seeData featurization in automated machine learning.

Azure AI services for custom AI
Azure AI servicesprovides features to build custom AI models and applications. The following sections provide an overview of these key features.
Custom speechis a feature of the Azure AI Speech service. You can use custom speech to evaluate and improve the accuracy of speech recognition for your applications and products. Use a custom speech model for real-time speech to text, speech translation, and batch transcription.
By default, speech recognition uses a universal language model as a base model. This model is trained with Microsoft-owned data and reflects commonly used spoken language. The base model is pretrained with dialects and phonetics that represent various common domains. When you make a speech recognition request, the most recent base model for your supported language is used by default. The base model works well in most speech recognition scenarios.
You can use a custom model to augment the base model. For example, you can improve the recognition of domain-specific vocabulary that's specific to an application by providing text data to train the model. You can also improve recognition for specific audio conditions of an application by providing audio data, including reference transcriptions.
If the data follows a pattern, you can use structured text to train a model. You can specify custom pronunciations and customize display text formatting with custom inverse text normalization, custom rewrite, and custom profanity filtering.
Custom translatoris a feature of theAzure AI Translatorservice.

Custom AI code languages
The core concept of AI is the use of algorithms to analyze data and generate models to describe, or score, it in useful ways. Developers and data scientists, and sometimes other algorithms, use programming code to write algorithms. Two of the most popular programming languages for AI development are Python and R.
Pythonis a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability. There's no compiling step. Python has a large standard library, and it supports the ability to add modules and packages. This feature encourages modularity and lets you expand capabilities when needed. There's a large and growing ecosystem of AI and machine learning libraries for Python, including many in Azure.
