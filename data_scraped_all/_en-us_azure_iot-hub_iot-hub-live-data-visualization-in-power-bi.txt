You can use Microsoft Power BI to visualize real-time sensor data that your Azure IoT hub receives. To do so, configure an Azure Stream Analytics job to consume the data from IoT Hub and route it to a dataset in Power BI.

Microsoft Power BIis a data visualization tool that you can use to perform self-service and enterprise business intelligence (BI) over large data sets.Azure Stream Analyticsis a fully managed, real-time analytics service designed to help you analyze and process fast moving streams of data that can be used to get insights, build reports or trigger alerts and actions.
In this tutorial, you perform the following tasks:
Create a consumer group on your IoT hub.
Create and configure an Azure Stream Analytics job to read temperature telemetry from your consumer group and send it to Power BI.
Create a report of the temperature data in Power BI and share it to the web.
If you don't have an Azure subscription,create a free accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, have the following prerequisites in place:
Complete one of theSend telemetryquickstarts in the development language of your choice. Alternatively, you can use any device app that sends temperature telemetry; for example, theRaspberry Pi online simulatoror one of theEmbedded device tutorials. These articles cover the following requirements:An active Azure subscription.An Azure IoT hub in your subscription.A client app that sends messages to your Azure IoT hub.

Add a consumer group to your IoT hub
Consumer groupsprovide independent views into the event stream that enable apps and Azure services to independently consume data from the same Event Hub endpoint. In this section, you add a consumer group to your IoT hub's built-in endpoint that is used later in this tutorial to pull data from the endpoint.
To add a consumer group to your IoT hub, follow these steps:
In theAzure portal, open your IoT hub.
In theAzure portal, open your IoT hub.
On the left pane, selectBuilt-in endpoints. Enter a name for your new consumer group in the text box underConsumer groups.

Clean up resources
In this tutorial, you created a Stream Analytics job and a dataset in Power BI.
If you plan to complete other tutorials, you may want to keep the resource group and IoT hub, so you can reuse them later.
Clean up Azure resources
Your Stream Analytics job should be in the same resource group as your IoT hub. If you don't need the IoT hub or the other resources you created any longer, you can delete the entire resource group in the Azure portal. Or, you can delete individual resources.
In the Azure portal, navigate to your resource group.
Review the resources in your group. If you want to delete them all, selectDelete resource group. If you want to delete an individual resource, right-click the resource, selectDeletefrom the context menu, and follow the prompts.
To remove the resource group and all of its resources, you can also use theaz group deletecommand:
az group delete --name {your resource group}
az group delete --name {your resource group}
Clean up Power BI resources
You created a dataset,PowerBiVisualizationDataSet, in Power BI. You can delete your dataset and the associated report you created from the Power BI service.
Sign in to yourPower BIaccount.
SelectWorkspaces, then select the name of the workspace that contains your dataset.
Hover over thePowerBiVisualizationDataSetdataset and select the three horizontal dots that appear to open theMore optionsmenu.
SelectDeleteand follow the prompts. When you remove the dataset, the report is removed as well.
Next steps
