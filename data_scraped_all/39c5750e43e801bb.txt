Online Service Terms (OST)
Here's where to find information about service terms:
Global OST
China OST
Online Service Premium Agreement (OSPA)
The China Enterprise customer who wants to purchase Azure through a contractual process can choose an Online Service Premium Agreement (OSPA). This
agreement supports two service models: Direct OSPA and Indirect OSPA. An OSPA discount can only be issued from a China local CE and approved by the Business Desk.
Multi-Year Monetary Commitment (MYMC)
MYMC is supported in China. The request can be raised by the local CE, and approved by the local Business Desk.
Reserved Instances / Compute Pre-purchase (CPP)
Reserved Instances are not supported by China legacy commerce platform. But you can get the annually pre-committed price by CPP (Compute Pre-purchase). CPP is fulfilled by a CPP amendment (order form), attached to the OSPA.
CPP SKU and prices are in the price list, which can be accessed from 21Vianet, Microsoft Account Teams and OSPA Indirect Partners.

A flexible billing account structure with the 21VCA-E
With the 21VCA-E, there are no upfront payments or minimum purchase required for Azure services:
Choose pay-as-you-go to pay just for what you use and get billed monthly in arrears
Choose Azure prepayment to make upfront payments for services usage
21VCA-E offers a seamless end-to-end process consisting of 4 steps to complete the transaction. Once the customer has completed the signing and chopping of the evergreen 21VCA customer agreement with the partner, the partner will then submit the entire package to 21V for the final validation. Deals that successfully pass this validation will be provisioned within a few of hours, resulting in a remarkable 6-8 times reduction in waiting time compared to the existing OSPA process.
