Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) will be retired onSeptember 30, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by September 30, 2027. For more information, seeAzure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) retirement.
Azure CDN from Edgio was retired onJanuary 15, 2025. For more information, seeAzure CDN from Edgio retirement FAQ.
With Azure diagnostic logs, you can view core analytics and save them into one or more destinations including:
Azure Storage account
Log Analytics workspace
Azure Event Hubs
This feature is available on content delivery network endpoints for all pricing tiers.
Diagnostics logs allow you to export basic usage metrics from your content delivery network endpoint to different kinds sources so that you can consume them in a customized way. You can do the following types of data export:
Export data to blob storage, export to CSV, and generate graphs in Excel.
Export data to Event Hubs and correlate with data from other Azure services.
Export data to Azure Monitor logs and view data in your own Log Analytics workspace
An Azure Content Delivery Network profile is required for the following steps. Refer toCreate an Azure Content Delivery Network profile and endpointbefore you continue.
Enable logging with the Azure portal

Consuming diagnostics logs from Azure Storage
This section describes the schema of content delivery network core analytics, organization in an Azure Storage account, and provides sample code to download the logs in a CSV file.
Using Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer
To download the tool, seeAzure Storage Explorer. After downloading and installing the software, configure it to use the same Azure Storage account that was configured as a destination to the content delivery network Diagnostics Logs.
OpenMicrosoft Azure Storage Explorer
Locate the storage account
Expand theBlob Containersnode under this storage account.
Select the container namedinsights-logs-coreanalytics.
Results show up on the right-hand pane, starting with the first level, asresourceId=. Continue selecting each level until you find the filePT1H.json. For an explanation of the path, seeBlob path format.
Each blobPT1H.jsonfile represents the analytics logs for one hour for a specific content delivery network endpoint or its custom domain.
The schema of the contents of this JSON file is described in the section schema of the core analytics logs.
Core analytics logs are generated every hour and the data is collected and stored inside a single Azure blob as a JSON payload. Storage explorer tool interprets '/' as a directory separator and shows the hierarchy. The path to the Azure blob appears as if there's a hierarchical structure and represents the blob name. The name of the blob follows the following naming convention:
resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{Subscription Id}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{Resource Group Name}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.CDN/PROFILES/{Profile Name}/ENDPOINTS/{Endpoint Name}/ y=/m=/d=/h=/m=/PT1H.json
resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{Subscription Id}/RESOURCEGROUPS/{Resource Group Name}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.CDN/PROFILES/{Profile Name}/ENDPOINTS/{Endpoint Name}/ y=/m=/d=/h=/m=/PT1H.json
Description of fields:
Exporting the core analytics data to a CSV file
To access core analytics, sample code for a tool is provided. This tool allows downloading the JSON files into a flat comma-separated file format, which can be used to create charts or other aggregations.
Here's how you can use the tool:
Visit the GitHub link:https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cdn-samples/tree/master/CoreAnalytics-ExportToCsv
Download the code.
Follow the instructions to compile and configure.
Run the tool.
The resulting CSV file shows the analytics data in a simple flat hierarchy.
Log data delays
Microsoft log data is delayed by up to 1 hour. This delay is due to the time it takes to process and store the data.

Diagnostic log types for content delivery network core analytics
Microsoft currently offers core analytics logs only, which contain metrics showing HTTP response statistics and egress statistics as seen from the content delivery network POPs/edges.
Core analytics metrics details
The following table shows a list of metrics available in the core analytics logs.
Not all metrics are available from all providers, although such differences are minimal. The table also displays whether a given metric is available from a provider. The metrics are available for only those content delivery network endpoints that have traffic on them.
*Outbound data transfer refers to traffic delivered from content delivery network POP servers to the client.
Schema of the core analytics logs
All logs are stored in JSON format and each entry has string fields according to the following schema:

Wheretimerepresents the start time of the hour boundary for which the statistics is reported. A metric unsupported by a content delivery network provider, instead of a double or integer value, results in a null value. This null value indicates the absence of a metric, and is different from a value of 0. One set of these metrics per domain is configured on the endpoint.
