You have several choices in how to deploy Azure DevOps on-premises. You can install everything on a single server. Or, you can use multiple application tiers and SQL instances. For information about how to determine the right type of deployment for your team, seeHardware recommendations.
Deployment choices
Single server:
A single-server deployment is the easiest deployment because the application-tier and data-tier are on the same machine. Choose this deployment when support a single team or small set of teams.

Dual servers:
A dual-server deployment, with separate application and data-tiers, can provide better performance for larger set of teams and to support teams which have above average usage.

Multiple servers:
Chooose this type of deployment, which involves multiple application and data tiers, to provide better performance for very large teams and teams with very heavy usage. By using more than one server, you improve high availability and disaster recovery ability.

Reporting configuration choices
Azure DevOps Server supports the Analytics Service which can be used in place of SQL Server Reporting Services or along side it. However, if you plan to use the Inheritance process model to customize work tracking, you can only use the Analytics Service for reporting, the project collection must not be configured to support reporting.
To learn more about the Analytics Service, seeWhat is the Analytics Service?. To learn more about the Inheritance process model, seeAbout process customization and inherited processes.
Note
Only new project collections can be configured to support the Inheritance process model. Upgraded project collections can only continue to support the On-premises XML process model.
Installations for evaluation or personal use
If you set up Azure DevOps on-premises for personal use or to evaluate it, useAzure DevOps Express. Azure DevOps Express is free, simple to set up, and installs on both client and server operating systems. It supports all of the same features as Azure DevOps Server. Azure DevOps Server Express licensing limits use to five active users.
Tip
Consider using a freeAzure DevOps Services organizationfor personal use. Because Azure DevOps Services are cloud-based, you don't need to install them on your own hardware or manage your own backups.
The deployment process
No matter how you plan to deploy Azure DevOps Server, the process involves the following three steps:
Preparation: The installer prepares one or more servers for Azure DevOps Server by reviewing and following thesystem requirements.

Installation: The installer places executables on your server and runs an installer from VisualStudio.com or the Volume Licensing Service Center.

Configuration: This step configures the installed features to get your installation up and running. When you run a configuration wizard, it runs a series of readiness checks. These checks make sure that your system meets the requirements and that your setting selections are likely to work. If there are any issues, one or more warnings or error messages display. After you resolve all errors, run the configuration to finish setting up your deployment.

When installation finishes, the installer starts the Azure DevOps Server Configuration Center. A unified wizard supports all Azure DevOps Server configurations, such as new installations, upgrades, and application-tier-only scenarios.
Note
Customizations made outside of the Configuration Center wizard may not be retained during upgrades. If you have implemented additional customizations, it is recommended to reapply them after the upgrade process. It is also advisable to refrain from modifying the web.config file. Furthermore, adding indexes, triggers, or fields to any of the databases is not supported and may result in an unsupported environment, potentially hindering future upgrades.

If you need to close the Configuration Center dialog, you can return to it. Start the Azure DevOps Server Administration Console, and selectConfigure Installed Featuresfrom theApplication Tier,Search, orProxy Serverpage. This option is only available when there are settings that still need configuration. For example, once the application tier has been fully configured, then you can only modify settings through the Azure DevOps Server Administration Console,Application Tierpage.


Configuration options: Basic, Advanced and Azure
The Server Configuration Wizard supports three main configuration options:Basic,Advanced, andAzure.
Basic
ChooseBasicwhen you want to configure the application-tier server and install and configure theSearchextension, or configure some other third party search feature. Installing and configuring Search supports Code, Work Item and Wiki search features. To learn more, seeConfigure search.
Advanced
ChooseAdvancedwhen you want to configure your deployment to support SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services, in addition to the features configured with theBasicoption.
Note
Advancedis not available on Azure Virtual Machines.  Use eitherBasicorAzure.
Azure
ChooseAzurewhen you have installed Azure DevOps Server on an Azure Virtual Machine and want to configure it using Azure SQL Database. For details, seeUse Azure SQL Database with Azure DevOps Server.
