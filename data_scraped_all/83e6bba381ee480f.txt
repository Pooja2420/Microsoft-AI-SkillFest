The factors that determine which data you can access in a Log Analytics workspace are:
The settings on the workspace itself.
Your access permissions to resources that send data to the workspace.
The method used to access the workspace.
This article describes how to manage access to data in a Log Analytics workspace.
Overview
The factors that define the data you can access are described in the following table. Each factor is further described in the sections that follow.
Access mode
Theaccess moderefers to how you access a Log Analytics workspace and defines the data you can access during the current session. The mode is determined according to thescopeyou select in Log Analytics.
There are two access modes:
Workspace-context: You can view all logs in the workspace for which you have permission. Queries in this mode are scoped to all data in tables that you have access to in the workspace. This access mode is used when logs are accessed with the workspace as the scope, such as when you selectLogson theAzure Monitormenu in the Azure portal.
Workspace-context: You can view all logs in the workspace for which you have permission. Queries in this mode are scoped to all data in tables that you have access to in the workspace. This access mode is used when logs are accessed with the workspace as the scope, such as when you selectLogson theAzure Monitormenu in the Azure portal.
Resource-context: When you access the workspace for a particular resource, resource group, or subscription, such as when you selectLogsfrom a resource menu in the Azure portal, you can view logs for only resources in all tables that you have access to. Queries in this mode are scoped to only data associated with that resource. This mode also enables granular Azure RBAC. Workspaces use a resource-context log model where every log record emitted by an Azure resource is automatically associated with this resource.

Workspaces use a resource-context log model where every log record emitted by an Azure resource is automatically associated with this resource.
Records are only available in resource-context queries if they're associated with the relevant resource. To check this association, run a query and verify that the_ResourceIdcolumn is populated.
There are known limitations with the following resources:
Computers outside of Azure: Resource-context is only supported withAzure Arc for servers.
Application Insights: Supported for resource-context only when using aworkspace-based Application Insights resource.
Azure Service Fabric
Compare access modes
The following table summarizes the access modes:
Access control mode
Theaccess control modeis a setting on each workspace that defines how permissions are determined for the workspace.
Require workspace permissions. This control mode doesn't allow granular Azure RBAC. To access the workspace, the user must begranted permissions to the workspaceor tospecific tables.If a user accesses the workspace inworkspace-context mode, they have access to all data in any table they've been granted access to. If a user accesses the workspace inresource-context mode, they have access to only data for that resource in any table they've been granted access to.This setting is the default for all workspaces created before March 2019.

Use resource or workspace permissions. This control mode allows granular Azure RBAC. Users can be granted access to only data associated with resources they can view by assigning Azurereadpermission.When a user accesses the workspace inworkspace-context mode, workspace permissions apply. When a user accesses the workspace inresource-context mode, only resource permissions are verified, and workspace permissions are ignored. Enable Azure RBAC for a user by removing them from workspace permissions and allowing their resource permissions to be recognized.This setting is the default for all workspaces created after March 2019.NoteIf a user has only resource permissions to the workspace, they can only access the workspace by using resource-context mode assuming the workspace access mode is set toUse resource or workspace permissions.

Configure access control mode for a workspace
Azure portal
PowerShell
Resource Manager
View the current workspace access control mode on theOverviewpage for the workspace in theLog Analytics workspacemenu.

Change this setting on thePropertiespage of the workspace. If you don't have permissions to configure the workspace, changing the setting is disabled.

Use the following command to view the access control mode for all workspaces in the subscription:
Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -ExpandProperties | foreach {$_.Name + ": " + $_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions}
Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -ExpandProperties | foreach {$_.Name + ": " + $_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions}
The output should resemble the following:
DefaultWorkspace38917: True
DefaultWorkspace21532: False
DefaultWorkspace38917: True
DefaultWorkspace21532: False
A value ofFalsemeans the workspace is configured withworkspace-contextaccess mode. A value ofTruemeans the workspace is configured withresource-contextaccess mode.
False
True
Note
If a workspace is returned without a Boolean value and is blank, this result also matches the results of aFalsevalue.
False
Use the following script to set the access control mode for a specific workspace toresource-contextpermission:
$WSName = "my-workspace"
$Workspace = Get-AzResource -Name $WSName -ExpandProperties
if ($Workspace.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions -eq $null)
    { $Workspace.Properties.features | Add-Member enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions $true -Force }
else
    { $Workspace.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions = $true }
Set-AzResource -ResourceId $Workspace.ResourceId -Properties $Workspace.Properties -Force
$WSName = "my-workspace"
$Workspace = Get-AzResource -Name $WSName -ExpandProperties
if ($Workspace.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions -eq $null)
    { $Workspace.Properties.features | Add-Member enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions $true -Force }
else
    { $Workspace.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions = $true }
Set-AzResource -ResourceId $Workspace.ResourceId -Properties $Workspace.Properties -Force
Use the following script to set the access control mode for all workspaces in the subscription toresource-contextpermission:
Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -ExpandProperties | foreach {
if ($_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions -eq $null)
    { $_.Properties.features | Add-Member enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions $true -Force }
else
    { $_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions = $true }
Set-AzResource -ResourceId $_.ResourceId -Properties $_.Properties -Force
}
Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -ExpandProperties | foreach {
if ($_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions -eq $null)
    { $_.Properties.features | Add-Member enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions $true -Force }
else
    { $_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions = $true }
Set-AzResource -ResourceId $_.ResourceId -Properties $_.Properties -Force
}
To configure the access mode in an Azure Resource Manager template, set theenableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissionsfeature flag on the workspace to one of the following values:
false: Set the workspace toworkspace-contextpermissions. This setting is the default if the flag isn't set.
true: Set the workspace toresource-contextpermissions.
Azure RBAC
Access to a workspace is managed by usingAzure RBAC. To grant access to the Log Analytics workspace by using Azure permissions, follow the steps inAssign Azure roles to manage access to your Azure subscription resources.
Workspace permissions
Each workspace can have multiple accounts associated with it. Each account can have access to multiple workspaces. The following table lists the Azure permissions for different workspace actions:
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/*/write
Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/*
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/*/read
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/<table_name>/read
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedKeys/action
Microsoft.Operationalinsights/workspaces/summarylogs/write
Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/*
Microsoft.OperationsManagement/*
Microsoft.Automation/*
Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*/write
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/searchJobs/write
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/restoreLogs/write
Built-in roles
Assign users to these roles to give them access at different scopes:
Subscription: Access to all workspaces in the subscription
Resource group: Access to all workspaces in the resource group
Resource: Access to only the specified workspace
Create assignments at the resource level (workspace) to assure accurate access control. Usecustom rolesto create roles with the specific permissions needed.
Note
To add and remove users to a user role, you must haveMicrosoft.Authorization/*/DeleteandMicrosoft.Authorization/*/Writepermission.
Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete
Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write
Members of the Log Analytics Reader role can view all monitoring data and monitoring settings, including the configuration of Azure diagnostics on all Azure resources. Allows members to view all data about resources within the assigned scope, including:

Resource permissions
To read data from or send data to a workspace in theresource context, you need these permissions on the resource:
Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read
Microsoft.Insights/logs/<tableName>/read
Microsoft.Insights/logs/Heartbeat/read
Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/write
The/readpermission is usually granted from a role that includes*/read or*permissions, such as the built-inReaderandContributorroles. Custom roles that include specific actions or dedicated built-in roles might not include this permission.
/read
Custom role examples
In addition to using the built-in roles for a Log Analytics workspace, you can create custom roles to assign more granular permissions. Here are some common examples.
Example 1: Grant a user permission to read log data from their resources.
Configure the workspace access control mode touse workspace or resource permissions.
Grant users*/readorMicrosoft.Insights/logs/*/readpermissions to their resources. If they're already assigned theLog Analytics Readerrole on the workspace, it's sufficient.
*/read
Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read
Example 2: Grant a user permission to read log data from their resources and run a search job.
Configure the workspace access control mode touse workspace or resource permissions.
Grant users*/readorMicrosoft.Insights/logs/*/readpermissions to their resources. If they're already assigned theLog Analytics Readerrole on the workspace, it's sufficient.
*/read
Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read
Grant users the following permissions on the workspace:Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write: Required to be able to create the search results table (_SRCH).Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/searchJobs/write: Required to allow executing the search job operation.
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write: Required to be able to create the search results table (_SRCH).
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/searchJobs/write: Required to allow executing the search job operation.
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/searchJobs/write
Example 3: Grant a user permission to read log data from their resources and configure their resources to send logs to the Log Analytics workspace.
Configure the workspace access control mode touse workspace or resource permissions.
Grant users the following permissions on the workspace:Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/readandMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedKeys/action. With these permissions, users can't perform any workspace-level queries. They can only enumerate the workspace and use it as a destination for diagnostic settings or agent configuration.
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedKeys/action
Grant users the following permissions to their resources:Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/readandMicrosoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/write. If they're already assigned theLog Analytics Contributorrole, assigned the Reader role, or granted*/readpermissions on this resource, it's sufficient.
Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read
Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/write
*/read
Example 4: Grant a user permission to read log data from their resources, but not to send logs to the Log Analytics workspace or read security events.
Configure the workspace access control mode touse workspace or resource permissions.
Grant users the following permissions to their resources:Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read.
Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read
Add the following NonAction to block users from reading the SecurityEvent type:Microsoft.Insights/logs/SecurityEvent/read. The NonAction shall be in the same custom role as the action that provides the read permission (Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read). If the user inherits the read action from another role that's assigned to this resource or to the subscription or resource group, they could read all log types. This scenario is also true if they inherit*/readthat exists, for example, with the Reader or Contributor role.
Microsoft.Insights/logs/SecurityEvent/read
Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read
*/read
Example 5: Grant a user permission to read log data from their resources and all Microsoft Entra sign-in and read Update Management solution log data in the Log Analytics workspace.
Configure the workspace access control mode touse workspace or resource permissions.
Grant users the following permissions on the workspace:Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read: Required so the user can enumerate the workspace and open the workspace pane in the Azure portalMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read: Required for every user that can execute queriesMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/SigninLogs/read: To be able to read Microsoft Entra sign-in logsMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/Update/read: To be able to read Update Management solution logsMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/UpdateRunProgress/read: To be able to read Update Management solution logsMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/UpdateSummary/read: To be able to read Update Management logsMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/Heartbeat/read: Required to be able to use Update Management solutionsMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/ComputerGroup/read: Required to be able to use Update Management solutionsGrant users the following permissions to their resources:*/read, assigned to the Reader role, orMicrosoft.Insights/logs/*/read
