This article addresses some common questions about Linux virtual machines created in Azure using the Resource Manager deployment model. For the Windows version of this topic, seeFrequently asked question about Windows Virtual Machines
What can I run on an Azure VM?
All subscribers can run server software on an Azure virtual machine. For more information, seeLinux on Azure-Endorsed Distributions
How much storage can I use with a virtual machine?
Each data disk can be up to 32,767 GiB. The number of data disks you can use depends on the size of the virtual machine. For details, seeSizes for Virtual Machines.
Azure Managed Disks are the recommended disk storage offerings for use with Azure Virtual Machines for persistent storage of data. You can use multiple Managed Disks with each Virtual Machine. Managed Disks offer two types of durable storage options: Premium and Standard Managed Disks. For pricing information, seeManaged Disks Pricing.
Azure storage accounts can also provide storage for the operating system disk and any data disks. Each disk is a .vhd file stored as a page blob. For pricing details, seeStorage Pricing Details.
How can I access my virtual machine?
Establish a remote connection to sign on to the virtual machine, using Secure Shell (SSH). See the instructions on how to connectfrom Windowsorfrom Linux and Mac. By default, SSH allows a maximum of 10 concurrent connections. You can increase this number by editing the configuration file.
If youâre having problems, check outTroubleshoot Secure Shell (SSH) connections.
Can I use the temporary disk, mounted under (/mnt) to store data?
Don't use the temporary disk, mounted under (/mnt) to store data. It's only there for temporary storage and if you want swap files. Data stored in there can't be recovered and it will be removed during certain virtual machine operations (stop/start, redeploy, and others).
Can I copy or clone an existing Azure VM?
Yes. For instructions, seeHow to create a copy of a Linux virtual machine in the Resource Manager deployment model.
Why am I not seeing Canada Central and Canada East regions through Azure Resource Manager?
The two new regions of Canada Central and Canada East aren't automatically registered for virtual machine creation for existing Azure subscriptions. This registration is done automatically when a virtual machine is deployed through the Azure portal to any other region using Azure Resource Manager. After a virtual machine is deployed to any other Azure region, the new regions should be available for subsequent virtual machines.
Can I add a NIC to my VM after it's created?
Yes, this is now possible. The VM first needs to be stopped deallocated. Then you can add or remove a NIC (unless it's the last NIC on the VM).
Are there any computer name requirements?
Yes. The computer name can be a maximum of 64 characters in length. SeeNaming conventions rules and restrictionsfor more information around naming your resources.
Are there any resource group name requirements?
Yes. The resource group name can be a maximum of 90 characters in length. SeeNaming conventions rules and restrictionsfor more information about resource groups.
What are the username requirements when creating a VM?
Usernames should be 1 - 32 characters in length.
The following usernames aren't allowed:

What are the password requirements when creating a VM?
There are varying password length requirements, depending on the tool you're using:
Azure portal - between 12 - 72 characters
Azure PowerShell - between 8 - 123 characters
Azure CLI - between 12 - 123 characters
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates - 12 - 72 characters and control characters aren't allowed
Passwords must also meet three out of the following four complexity requirements:
Have lower characters
Have upper characters
Have a digit
Have a special character (Regex match [\W_])
The following passwords aren't allowed:
abc@123
P@$$w0rd
P@ssw0rd
P@ssword123
Pa$$word
pass@word1
