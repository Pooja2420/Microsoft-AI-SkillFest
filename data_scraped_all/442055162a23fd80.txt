LUIS will be retired on October 1st 2025 and starting April 1st 2023 you will not be able to create new LUIS resources. We recommendmigrating your LUIS applicationstoconversational language understandingto benefit from continued product support and multilingual capabilities.
LUIS supports Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), an authorization system for managing individual access to Azure resources. Using Azure RBAC, you assign different team members different levels of permissions for your LUIS authoring resources. See theAzure RBAC documentationfor more information.

Enable Microsoft Entra authentication
To use Azure RBAC, you must enable Microsoft Entra authentication. You cancreate a new resource with a custom subdomainorcreate a custom subdomain for your existing resource.
Add role assignment to Language Understanding Authoring resource
Azure RBAC can be assigned to a Language Understanding Authoring resource. To grant access to an Azure resource, you add a role assignment.
In theAzure portal, selectAll services.
In theAzure portal, selectAll services.
SelectAzure AI services, and navigate to your specific Language Understanding Authoring resource.NoteYou can also set up Azure RBAC for whole resource groups, subscriptions, or management groups. Do this by selecting the desired scope level and then navigating to the desired item. For example, selectingResource groupsand then navigating to a specific resource group.

Within a few minutes, the target will be assigned the selected role at the selected scope. For help with these steps, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
LUIS role types
Use the following table to determine access needs for your LUIS application.
These custom roles only apply to authoring (Language Understanding Authoring) and not prediction resources (Language Understanding).
Note
OwnerandContributorroles take priority over the custom LUIS roles.
Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Microsoft Entra ID) is only used with custom LUIS roles.
If you are assigned as aContributoron Azure, your role will be shown asOwnerin LUIS portal.
Cognitive Services LUIS Reader
A user that should only be validating and reviewing LUIS applications, typically a tester to ensure the application is performing well before deploying the project. They may want to review the applicationâs assets (utterances, intents, entities) to notify the app developers of any changes that need to be made, but do not have direct access to make them.

Cognitive Services LUIS Writer
A user that is responsible for building and modifying LUIS application, as a collaborator in a larger team. The collaborator can modify the LUIS application in any way, train those changes, and validate/test those changes in the portal. However, this user wouldn't have access to deploying this application to the runtime, as they may accidentally reflect their changes in a production environment. They also wouldn't be able to delete the application or alter its prediction resources and endpoint settings (assigning or unassigning prediction resources, making the endpoint public). This restricts this role from altering an application currently being used in a production environment. They may also create new applications under this resource, but with the restrictions mentioned.

Cognitive Services LUIS Owner
Note
If you are assigned as anOwnerandLUIS Owneryou will be shown asLUIS Ownerin LUIS portal.
These users are the gatekeepers for LUIS applications in a production environment. They should have full access to any of the underlying functions and thus can view everything in the application and have direct access to edit any changes for both authoring and runtime environments.
