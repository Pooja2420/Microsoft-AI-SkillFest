This article provides the detailed resource limits for single databases in Azure SQL Database using the vCore purchasing model.
For elastic pool vCore resource limits,vCore resource limits - elastic pools.
For limits of the logical server in Azure, seeOverview of resource limits on a server.
For DTU purchasing model resource limits, seeDTU resource limits single databasesandDTU resource limits elastic pools.
For more information regarding the different purchasing models, seePurchasing models and service tiers.
Important
Shrink operations should not be considered a regular maintenance operation. Data and log files that grow due to regular, recurring business operations do not require shrink operations.
Under some circumstances, you might need to shrink a database to reclaim unused space. For more information, seeManage file space in Azure SQL Database.
For scaling guidance and considerations, seeScale a single database.
Each read-only replica of a database has its own resources, such as vCores, memory, data IOPS,tempdb, workers, and sessions. Each read-only replica is subject to the resource limits detailed later in this article.
tempdb
You can set the service tier, compute size (service objective), and storage amount for a single database using:
Transact-SQLviaALTER DATABASE
Azure portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
REST API

The Gen5 hardware in the vCore purchasing model has been renamed tostandard-series (Gen5).

Hyperscale - provisioned compute - premium-series
Although the published Hyperscale resource limits for standard-series and premium-series are the same, premium-series offers faster CPU performance compared to standard-series, and scales up to 128 vCores, compared to 80 vCores for standard-series. Resources using premium-series are guaranteed to run on hardware with newer CPUs. Standard-series does not provide this guarantee and, depending on availability, resources can be placed on older hardware. There is no price difference between the two, but premium-series might not be available in all regions.

Compute sizes (service level objectives, or SLOs) in the Business Critical DC-series databases follow the naming conventionBC_DC_followed by the number of vCores.
