APPLIES TO:NoSQL
Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL supports queries with parameters expressed by the familiar @ notation. Parameterized SQL provides robust handling and escaping of user input, and prevents accidental exposure of data through SQL injection.
Examples
For example, you can write a query that takesupperPriceLimitas a parameter, and execute it for various values ofpricebased on user input.
upperPriceLimit
price
SELECT
    *
FROM
    p
WHERE
    (NOT p.onSale) AND
    (p.price BETWEEN 0 AND @upperPriceLimit)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    p
WHERE
    (NOT p.onSale) AND
    (p.price BETWEEN 0 AND @upperPriceLimit)
You can then send this request to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as a parameterized JSON query object.
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM p WHERE (NOT p.onSale) AND (p.price BETWEEN 0 AND @upperPriceLimit)",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "@upperPriceLimit",
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM p WHERE (NOT p.onSale) AND (p.price BETWEEN 0 AND @upperPriceLimit)",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "@upperPriceLimit",
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
This next example sets theTOPargument with a parameterized query:
TOP
{
  "query": "SELECT TOP @pageSize * FROM products",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "@pageSize",
      "value": 10
    }
  ]
}
{
  "query": "SELECT TOP @pageSize * FROM products",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "@pageSize",
      "value": 10
    }
  ]
}
Parameter values can be any valid JSON: strings, numbers, booleans, null, even arrays or nested JSON. Since Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is schemaless, parameters aren't validated against any type.
Here are examples for parameterized queries in each Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL SDK:
.NET SDK
Java
Node.js
