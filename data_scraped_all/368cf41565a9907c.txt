Theguided portal experienceassists in the configuration of ExpressRoute circuits for maximum resiliency. The subsequent diagram illustrates the logical architecture of an ExpressRoute circuit designed for maximum resiliency."

Circuits configured for maximum resiliency provide both site (peering location) redundancy and intra-site redundancy. After deploying multi-site redundant ExpressRoute circuits, it's essential to ensure that on-premises routes are advertised over the redundant circuits to fully utilize the benefits of multi-site redundancy. This article offers a guide on how to manually validate your router advertisements and test the resiliency provided by your multi-site redundant ExpressRoute circuit deployment.
Prerequisites
Before performing a manual failover of an ExpressRoute circuit, it's imperative that your ExpressRoute circuits are appropriately configured. For more information, see the guide onConfiguring ExpressRoute Circuits. It's also crucial to ensure that all on-premises routes are advertised over both redundant circuits in the maximum resiliency ExpressRoute configuration.

Verify that identical routes are being advertised over both redundant circuits, navigate to thePeeringspage of the ExpressRoute circuit within the Azure portal. Select theAzure privatepeering row and then select theView route tableoption at the top of the page.The routes advertised over the ExpressRoute circuit should be identical across both redundant circuits. If the routes aren't identical, we recommend you review the configuration of the on-premises routers and the ExpressRoute circuits.

Initiate ExpressRoute circuit manual failover
Note
The following procedure outlined will result in the disconnection of both redundant connections of the ExpressRoute circuit. Therefore, it's important that you do this test during scheduled maintenance windows or during off-peak hours. You should also ensure that a redundant circuit is available to provide connectivity to your on-premises network.
To manually failover an ExpressRoute circuit that is configured with maximum resiliency, follow these steps:

After verifying the successful completion of the failover, it's crucial to re-enable peering for the second ExpressRoute circuit to resume normal operation.
