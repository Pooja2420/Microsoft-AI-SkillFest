This document shows you how to back up secrets, keys, and certificates stored in your key vault. A backup is intended to provide you with an offline copy of all your secrets in the unlikely event that you lose access to your key vault.
Overview
Azure Key Vault automatically provides features to help you maintain availability and prevent data loss. Back up secrets only if you have a critical business justification. Backing up secrets in your key vault may introduce operational challenges such as maintaining multiple sets of logs, permissions, and backups when secrets expire or rotate.
Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically fail over requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user. For more information, seeAzure Key Vault availability and redundancy.
If you want protection against accidental or malicious deletion of your secrets, configure soft-delete and purge protection features on your key vault. For more information, seeAzure Key Vault soft-delete overview.
Limitations
Important
Key Vault does not support the ability to backup more than 500 past versions of a key, secret, or certificate object, and attempting to do so may result in an error. It is not possible to delete previous versions of a key, secret, or certificate.
Key Vault doesn't currently provide a way to back up an entire key vault in a single operation and keys, secrets, and certificates must be backup individually.
Also consider the following issues:
Backing up secrets that have multiple versions might cause time-out errors.
A backup creates a point-in-time snapshot. Secrets might renew during a backup, causing a mismatch of encryption keys.
If you exceed key vault service limits for requests per second, your key vault will be throttled, and the backup will fail.
Design considerations
When you back up a key vault object, such as a secret, key, or certificate, the backup operation will download the object as an encrypted blob. This blob can't be decrypted outside of Azure. To get usable data from this blob, you must restore the blob into a key vault within the same Azure subscription andAzure geography.
Prerequisites
To back up a key vault object, you must have:
Contributor-level or higher permissions on an Azure subscription.
A primary key vault that contains the secrets you want to back up.
A secondary key vault where secrets will be restored.
