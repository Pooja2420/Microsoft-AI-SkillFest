Azure Database Migration Service is a fully managed service designed to enable seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime (online migrations).
With Azure Database Migration Service currently we offer two versions:
Database Migration Service - viaAzure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio,Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI.

Database Migration Servicepowers the "Azure SQL Migration" extension for Azure Data Studio, and provides more features. Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI can also be used to access DMS. Currently, it supports SQL Database modernization to Azure. For improved functionality and supportability, consider migrating to Azure SQL Database by using the DMS.
Database Migration Service (classic)via Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI is an older version of the Azure Database Migration Service. It offers database modernization to Azure and support scenarios like â SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

Azure Database Migration Service (classic) - SQL scenarios are on a deprecation path. SinceAugust 1, 2023, you're no longer able to create new Database Migration Service (classic) resources for SQL Server scenarios from Azure portal. The service will be retired onMarch 15, 2026for all customers.
