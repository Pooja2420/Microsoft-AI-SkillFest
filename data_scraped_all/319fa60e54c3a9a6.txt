How soft delete works
When soft delete is enabled, deleted file shares are retained in a soft deleted state for the defined retention period before being permanently deleted. When you undelete a file share, the file share and all of contents, including snapshots, are restored to their state prior to deletion.
Important
Soft delete only works on a file share level. If you want to be able to restore deleted files, you can useshare snapshotsorAzure file share backup.
Soft delete for file shares is enabled at the storage account level so the soft delete settings apply to all file shares within a storage account. New storage accounts have soft delete enabled by default, but you can enable or disable soft delete as desired for new or existing storage accounts. If you disable soft delete, any file shares deleted before disabling soft delete can still be undeleted.
By default, the retention period for file shares is 7 days, but you can specify any retention period between 1 and 365 days. The retention period clock starts when the file share is deleted. You can change the soft delete retention period at any time. Shares deleted before the retention period update expire based on the retention period that was configured when that data was deleted.
To permanently delete a file share in a soft delete state before its expiry time, you must undelete the share, disable soft delete, and then delete the share again. If desired, remember to reenable soft delete for the storage account to protect other file shares from accidental deletion.
For soft-deleted provisioned file shares, the file share quota (the provisioned size of a file share) is used in the total storage account quota calculation until the soft-deleted share expiry date, when the share is fully deleted.
Billing
Billing for soft delete depends on the billing model of the file share. For more information, see the following:

The following sections show how to enable and use soft delete for Azure file shares on an existing storage account:
Portal

To enable soft delete, you must update the settings for all Azure file shares, also known as theFileServiceproperties. The following example enables soft delete for all file shares in a storage account. Remember to replace<resource-group>and<storage-account>with the appropriate values for your environment.
FileService
<resource-group>
<storage-account>
$resourceGroupName = "<resource-group>"
$storageAccountName = "<storage-account>"

Update-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -EnableShareDeleteRetentionPolicy $true `
    -ShareRetentionDays 7
$resourceGroupName = "<resource-group>"
$storageAccountName = "<storage-account>"

Update-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -EnableShareDeleteRetentionPolicy $true `
    -ShareRetentionDays 7
You can verify if soft delete is enabled and view its retention policy with the following command:
Get-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName
Get-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName
To enable soft delete, you must update a file client's service properties. The following example enables soft delete for all file shares in a storage account. Remember to replace<resource-group>and<storage-account>with the appropriate values for your environment.
<resource-group>
<storage-account>
resourceGroupName="<resource-group>"
storageAccountName="<storage-account>"

az storage account file-service-properties update \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --account-name $storageAccountName \
    --enable-delete-retention true \
    --delete-retention-days 7
resourceGroupName="<resource-group>"
storageAccountName="<storage-account>"

az storage account file-service-properties update \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --account-name $storageAccountName \
    --enable-delete-retention true \
    --delete-retention-days 7
You can verify if soft delete is enabled and view its retention policy with the following command:
az storage account file-service-properties show \
    -resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    -account-name $storageAccountName
az storage account file-service-properties show \
    -resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    -account-name $storageAccountName
Restore soft deleted file share
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
To restore a soft deleted file share:
Navigate to your storage account and selectFile shares.
Navigate to your storage account and selectFile shares.
On the file share blade, enableShow deleted sharesto display any shares that are soft deleted.This displays any shares currently in aDeletedstate.

Select the share and selectundeleteto restore the share.You can confirm the share is restored when its status switches toActive.
Select the share and selectundeleteto restore the share.
You can confirm the share is restored when its status switches toActive.

To restore a soft deleted file share, you must first get the-DeletedShareVersionvalue of the share. To get that value, use the following command to list out all the deleted shares for your storage account.
-DeletedShareVersion
Get-AzRmStorageShare `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -IncludeDeleted
Get-AzRmStorageShare `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -IncludeDeleted
Once you identify the share you want to restore, you can use the following command to restore it:
Restore-AzRmStorageShare `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -DeletedShareVersion 01D5E2783BDCDA97 # replace with your deleted version number
Restore-AzRmStorageShare `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -DeletedShareVersion 01D5E2783BDCDA97 # replace with your deleted version number
To restore a soft deleted file share, you must first get the--deleted-versionvalue of the share. To get that value, use the following command to list out all the deleted shares for your storage account.
--deleted-version
az storage share-rm list \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --storage-account $storageAccountName \
    --include-deleted
az storage share-rm list \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --storage-account $storageAccountName \
    --include-deleted
Once you identify the share you'd like to restore, you can restore it with the following command:
az storage share-rm restore -n deletedshare --deleted-version 01D64EB9886F00C4 -g yourResourceGroup --storage-account yourStorageaccount
az storage share-rm restore -n deletedshare --deleted-version 01D64EB9886F00C4 -g yourResourceGroup --storage-account yourStorageaccount
