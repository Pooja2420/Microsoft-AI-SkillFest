Add pipeline permissions to a repository resource
You can also set a repository to only be used on specific YAML pipelines. Restricting a repository to specific pipelines prevents an unauthorized YAML pipeline in your project from using your repository. This setting only applies to YAML pipelines.
Important
Access to all pipelines is turnedoffforprotected resourcesby default. To grant access to all pipelines, enter a check in the security box next to "Grant access permission to all pipelines" for the resource. You can do so when you're creating or editing a resource. You'll need to have the repositoryAdministratorrole to have this option available.
