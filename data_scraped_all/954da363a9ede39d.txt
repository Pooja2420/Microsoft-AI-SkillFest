autoclusterfinds common patterns of discrete attributes (dimensions) in the data. It then reduces the results of the original query, whether it's 100 or 100,000 rows, to a few patterns. The plugin was developed to help analyze failures (such as exceptions or crashes) but can potentially work on any filtered dataset. The plugin is invoked with theevaluateoperator.

Note
autoclusteris largely based on the Seed-Expand algorithm from the following paper:Algorithms for Telemetry Data Mining using Discrete Attributes.

Returns
Theautoclusterplugin usually returns a small set of patterns. The patterns capture portions of the data with shared common values across multiple discrete attributes. Each pattern in the results is represented by a row.
autocluster
The first column is the segment ID. The next two columns are the count and percentage of rows out of the original query that are captured by the pattern. The remaining columns are from the original query. Their value is either a specific value from the column, or a wildcard value (which are by default null) meaning variable values.
The patterns aren't distinct, may be overlapping, and usually don't cover all the original rows. Some rows may not fall under any pattern.
Tip
Usewhereandprojectin the input pipe to reduce the data to just what you're interested in.
When you find an interesting row, you might want to drill into it further by adding its specific values to yourwherefilter.

Using evaluate
T | evaluate autocluster()

Using autocluster
Run the query
StormEvents
| where monthofyear(StartTime) == 5
| extend Damage = iff(DamageCrops + DamageProperty > 0 , "YES" , "NO")
| project State , EventType , Damage
| evaluate autocluster(0.6)
StormEvents
| where monthofyear(StartTime) == 5
| extend Damage = iff(DamageCrops + DamageProperty > 0 , "YES" , "NO")
| project State , EventType , Damage
| evaluate autocluster(0.6)
Output
Using custom wildcards
Run the query
StormEvents
| where monthofyear(StartTime) == 5
| extend Damage = iff(DamageCrops + DamageProperty > 0 , "YES" , "NO")
| project State , EventType , Damage
| evaluate autocluster(0.2, '~', '~', '*')
