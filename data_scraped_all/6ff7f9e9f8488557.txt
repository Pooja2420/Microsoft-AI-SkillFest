Overview
The Azure Diagnostics VM extension enables you to collect monitoring data, such as performance counters and event logs, from your Windows VM. You can granularly specify what data you want to collect and where you want the data to go, such as an Azure Storage account or an Azure Event Hub. You can also use this data to build charts in the Azure portal or create metric alerts.
Prerequisites
Operating system
The Azure Diagnostics Extension can be run against Windows 10 Client, Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, and 2016.
Internet connectivity
The Azure Diagnostics Extension requires that the target virtual machine is connected to the internet.
Extension schema
The Azure Diagnostics Extension schema and property values are described in this document.
Template deployment
Azure VM extensions can be deployed with Azure Resource Manager templates. The JSON schema detailed in the previous section can be used in an Azure Resource Manager template to run the Azure Diagnostics extension during an Azure Resource Manager template deployment. SeeUse monitoring and diagnostics with a Windows VM and Azure Resource Manager templates.
Azure CLI deployment
The Azure CLI can be used to deploy the Azure Diagnostics extension to an existing virtual machine. Replace the protected settings and settings properties with valid JSON from the extension schema above.
az vm extension set \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vm-name myVM \
  --name IaaSDiagnostics \
  --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics \
  --version 1.9.0.0 --protected-settings protected-settings.json \
  --settings public-settings.json
az vm extension set \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vm-name myVM \
  --name IaaSDiagnostics \
  --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics \
  --version 1.9.0.0 --protected-settings protected-settings.json \
  --settings public-settings.json
PowerShell deployment
TheSet-AzVMDiagnosticsExtensioncommand can be used to add the Azure Diagnostics extension to an existing virtual machine. See alsoUse PowerShell to enable Azure Diagnostics in a virtual machine running Windows.
Set-AzVMDiagnosticsExtension
$vm_resourcegroup = "myvmresourcegroup"
$vm_name = "myvm"
$diagnosticsconfig_path = "DiagnosticsPubConfig.xml"

Set-AzVMDiagnosticsExtension -ResourceGroupName $vm_resourcegroup `
  -VMName $vm_name `
  -DiagnosticsConfigurationPath $diagnosticsconfig_path
$vm_resourcegroup = "myvmresourcegroup"
$vm_name = "myvm"
$diagnosticsconfig_path = "DiagnosticsPubConfig.xml"

Set-AzVMDiagnosticsExtension -ResourceGroupName $vm_resourcegroup `
  -VMName $vm_name `
  -DiagnosticsConfigurationPath $diagnosticsconfig_path
Troubleshoot and support
Troubleshoot
Data about the state of extension deployments can be retrieved from the Azure portal, and by using the Azure CLI. To see the deployment state of extensions for a given VM, run the following command using the Azure CLI.
az vm extension list --resource-group myResourceGroup --vm-name myVM -o table
az vm extension list --resource-group myResourceGroup --vm-name myVM -o table
See this articlefor a more comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the Azure Diagnostics extension.
