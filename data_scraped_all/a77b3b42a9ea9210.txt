Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
Lift and shift, also known asrehosting, is the process of mainframe migration to produce an exact copy of an application, workload, and all associated data from one environment to another. Mainframe applications can be migrated from on-premises to public or private cloud.
TmaxSoft OpenFrame is a rehosting solution that makes it easy to lift-and-shift existing IBM zSeries mainframe applications to Microsoft Azure, using a no-code approach. TmaxSoft quickly migrates an existing application, as is, to a zSeries mainframe emulation environment on Azure.
This article illustrates how the TmaxSoft OpenFrame solution runs on Azure. The approach consists of two virtual machines (VMs) running Linux in anactive-activeconfiguration. An Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic between the VMs. OpenFrame emulation software runs on the VMs and provides a zSeries runtime and facilities. Working with the OpenFrame software is an Azure SQL Database. This modernized database layer includes built-in business continuity features.
Potential use cases
Many scenarios can benefit from TmaxSoft OpenFrame lift and shift. Possibilities include the following cases:
Businesses seeking to modernize infrastructure and escape the high costs, limitations, and rigidity associated with mainframes.
Organizations opting to move IBM zSeries mainframe workloads to the cloud without the side effects of a complete redevelopment.
IBM zSeries mainframe customers who need to migrate mission-critical applications while maintaining continuity with other on-premises applications.
Teams looking for the horizontal and vertical scalability that Azure offers.
Businesses that favor solutions offering disaster recovery options.

At the center of the diagram are two virtual machines. Labeled boxes indicate that TmaxSoft OpenFrame software runs on the machines, and each box represents a different type of software. These programs migrate applications to Azure and handle transaction processes. They also manage batch programs and provide security. A load balancer is pictured above the virtual machines. Arrows show that it distributes incoming traffic between the machines. Below the virtual machines, a file sharing system is pictured, and to the right is a database. From arrows, it's clear that the virtual machines communicate with the file share and the database. A dotted line surrounds all these components. Outside that line are on-premises users, Azure users, and disaster recovery services. Arrows show the users interacting with the system.

On-premises users interact withOpenFrameapplications by using 3270 WebTerminal, OFManager, and OFStudio:The web application 3270 WebTerminal runs in browsers. This app connects users withCustomer Information Control System (CICS)andInformation Management System - Data Communications (IMS-DC)applications. By providing access to these 3270 terminal screens, the 3270 WebTerminal app eliminates the need for TN3270 terminal emulation software.OFManagerprovides tools for executing, monitoring, and managing batch workloads. This web application also monitors and manages datasets and security systems.OFStudioprovides an IDE for programming, debugging, and maintaining applications.

Azure ExpressRoute creates private connections between the on-premises infrastructure and Azure. Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections that use port 443 provide access to web-based applications:After migration, the web application presentation layer remains virtually unchanged. As a result, end users require minimal retraining. Alternatively, the web application presentation layer can be updated to align with UX goals.Azure Bastion hostswork to maximize security. While giving administrators access to VMs, these hosts minimize the number of open ports.OpenFrame provides middleware integration. For instance, this functionality works with web services andmessage queues (MQs).
