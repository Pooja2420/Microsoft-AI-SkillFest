Quickly create and query a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse Analytics using the Azure portal.
Important
This quickstart helps you to create a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW). To create a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and take advantage of the latest features and integration in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, instead useQuickstart: Create a dedicated SQL pool using Synapse Studio.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree Azure accountbefore you begin.NoteCreating a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse may result in a new billable service. For more information, seeAzure Synapse Analytics pricing.

Create a SQL pool
Data warehouses are created using dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse Analytics. A dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) is created with a defined set ofcompute resources. The database is created within anAzure resource groupand in alogical SQL server.
Follow these steps to create a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) that contains theAdventureWorksDWsample data.

Create a server-level firewall rule
The Azure Synapse service creates a firewall at the server-level. This firewall prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server or any databases on the server. To enable connectivity, you can add firewall rules that enable connectivity for specific IP addresses. Follow these steps to create aserver-level firewall rulefor your client's IP address.
Note
Azure Synapse communicates over port 1433. If you are trying to connect from within a corporate network, outbound traffic over port 1433 might not be allowed by your network's firewall. If so, you cannot connect to your server unless your IT department opens port 1433.
After the deployment completes, selectAll servicesfrom the menu. SelectDatabases, select the star next toAzure Synapse Analyticsto add Azure Synapse Analytics to your favorites.

SelectAzure Synapse Analyticsfrom the left-hand menu and then selectmySampleDataWarehouseon theAzure Synapse Analyticspage. The overview page for your database opens, showing you the fully qualified server name (such assqlpoolservername.database.windows.net) and provides options for further configuration.

You can now connect to the server and its SQL pools using this IP address. The connection works from SQL Server Management Studio or another tool of your choice. When you connect, use the ServerAdmin account you created previously.
Important
By default, access through the SQL Database firewall is enabled for all Azure services. SelectOFFon this page and then selectSaveto disable the firewall for all Azure services.
Get the fully qualified server name

Run some queries
It is not recommended to run large queries while being logged as the server admin, as it uses alimited resource class. Instead configureWorkload Isolationasillustrated in the tutorials.
Azure Synapse Analytics uses T-SQL as the query language. To open a query window and run some T-SQL queries, use the following steps in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
In Object Explorer, right-clickmySampleDataWarehouseand selectNew Query. A new query window opens.

Clean up resources
You're being charged for data warehouse units and data stored your dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW). These compute and storage resources are billed separately.
If you want to keep the data in storage, you can pause compute when you aren't using the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW). By pausing compute, you're only charged for data storage. You can resume compute whenever you're ready to work with the data.
