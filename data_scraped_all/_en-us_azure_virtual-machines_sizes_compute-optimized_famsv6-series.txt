The Famsv6-series utilizes AMD's fourth Generation EPYCâ¢â¯9004 processor that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.7 GHz with up to 320 MB L3 cache. The Famsv6 VM series comes without Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), meaning a vCPU is now mapped to a full physical core, allowing software processes to run on dedicated and uncontested resources. These new full core VMs suit workloads demanding the highest CPU performance. Famsv6-series offers up to 64 full core vCPUs and 512 GiB of RAM. This series is optimized for scientific simulations, financial and risk analysis, gaming, rendering and other workloads able to take advantage of the exceptional performance. Customers running software licensed on per-vCPU basis can use these VMs to optimize compute costs within their infrastructure.

Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
Accelerator (GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) info for each size
Note
No accelerators are present in this series.
Note
This VM series will only work on OS images that support NVMe. If your current OS image doesn't have NVMe support, youâll see an error message.NVMesupport is available on the most popular OS images, and we're continuously improving OS image compatibility.
