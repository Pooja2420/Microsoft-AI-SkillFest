Configure Customer Managed Keys for data encryption in healthcare agent service
Article
2024-10-20
In this article
healthcare agent service automatically encrypts all your data at rest, helping to meet your organizational security and compliance goals.
By default, healthcare agent service uses Microsoft-managed encryption keys. For other control over encryption keys, you can supplement default encryption with an other encryption layer using your own keys, which is called customer-managed keys (CMK).
Note
Your healthcare agent service resource must have been created after November 11, 2021 to use Customer Managed Keys.
Enable Customer Managed Keys
Follow the following steps to enable CMK:
1 - Create an Identity for healthcare agent service
Sign in to Azure portaland create a new healthcare agent service, or open an existing healthcare agent service resource (provided it was created after November 11, 2021).

Navigate to theIdentityblade, and enable aSystem-assigned identity. Once the system assigned managed identity is enabled, the healthcare agent service resource is registered with Microsoft Entra ID.

2 - Enable soft-delete and purge protection in Key Vault
As a first step, make sure soft-delete and purge protection are enabled on the key vault. Due to the nature of encryption with customer-managed keys, no one can retrieve your data if your Azure Key vault key is deleted.
To prevent data loss caused by accidental Key Vault key deletions, soft-delete and purge protection must be enabled on the key vault. Soft-delete is enabled by default, so you'll only encounter issues if you purposely disabled it. Purge protection isn't enabled by default, but it's required for customer-managed key encryption in healthcare agent service.
Sign in to Azure portal and open your key vault overview page.

3 - Create a new key in Key Vault
Skip key generation if you already have a key in Azure Key Vault that you want to use, but collect the Key Name. You'll need this information when enabling CMK.

Four - Enable CMK in healthcare agent service
Next, configure your healthcare agent service to use customer-managed keys with Azure Key Vault, and specify the key to use.
Navigate to theEncryptionblade in yourhealthcare agent serviceresource. By default, key management is set to Microsoft Managed Keys, as shown in the following image.

Caution
Once CMK has been enabled, deleting the healthcare agent service resource will automatically revoke access to Key Vault and customer data will become inaccessible, as it could no longer be decrypted.This action cannot be undone. If you need to create a backup of your healthcare agent service, or export any data, make sure to do sobefore deleting your healthcare agent service resource.
