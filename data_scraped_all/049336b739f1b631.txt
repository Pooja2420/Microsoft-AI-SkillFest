Azure Hybrid Benefitallows you to exchange your existing licenses for discounted rates on Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. You can save up to 30 percent or more on SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance by using your Software Assurance-enabled SQL Server licenses on Azure. TheAzure Hybrid Benefitpage has a calculator to help determine savings.
Changing to Azure Hybrid Benefit does not require any downtime.
Overview

Diagram of vCore pricing structure for SQL Database. 'License Included' pricing is made up of base compute and SQL license components. Azure Hybrid Benefit pricing is made up of base compute and software assurance components.

With Azure Hybrid Benefit, you pay only for the underlying Azure infrastructure by using your existing SQL Server license for the SQL Server database engine itself (Base Compute pricing). If you do not use Azure Hybrid Benefit, you pay for both the underlying infrastructure and the SQL Server license (License-Included pricing).
For Azure SQL Database, Azure Hybrid Benefit is only available when using the provisioned compute tier of thevCore-based purchasing model. Azure Hybrid Benefit doesn't apply toDTU-based purchasing modelsor theserverless compute tier.

Frequently asked questions
Are there dual-use rights with Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server?
You have 180 days of dual use rights of the license to ensure migrations are running seamlessly. After that 180-day period, you can only use the SQL Server license on Azure. You no longer have dual use rights on-premises and on Azure.
How does Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server differ from license mobility?
We offer license mobility benefits to SQL Server customers with Software Assurance. License mobility allows reassignment of their licenses to a partner's shared servers. You can use this benefit on Azure IaaS and AWS EC2.
Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server differs from license mobility in two key areas:
It provides economic benefits for moving highly virtualized workloads to Azure. SQL Server Enterprise Edition customers can get four cores in Azure in the General Purpose SKU for every core they own on-premises for highly virtualized applications. License mobility doesn't allow any special cost benefits for moving virtualized workloads to the cloud.
It provides for a PaaS destination on Azure (SQL Managed Instance) that's highly compatible with SQL Server.
What are the specific rights of the Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server?
SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance customers have the following rights associated with Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server:
Can pay base rate on General Purpose or Business Critical SKU
One core on-premises = Four vCores in General Purpose SKU
One core on-premises = One vCore in Business Critical SKU
Can pay base rate on General Purpose or Business Critical SKU
One core on-premises = One vCore in General Purpose SKU
Four cores on-premises = One vCore in Business Critical SKU
