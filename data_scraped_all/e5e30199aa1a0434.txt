In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, resources and workloads are assessed against built-in and custom security standards enabled in your Azure subscriptions, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects. Based on those assessments, security recommendations provide practical steps to remediate security issues and improve security posture.
Defender for Cloud proactively uses a dynamic engine that assesses the risks in your environment while considering the potential for exploitation and the potential business affect on your organization. The engine prioritizes security recommendations based on the risk factors of each resource. The context of the environment determines these risk factors. This context includes the resource's configuration, network connections, and security posture.
Prerequisites
You mustenable Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)on your environment.
Note
Recommendations are included by default with Defender for Cloud, but you can't seerisk prioritizationwithout Defender CSPM enabled on your environment.

Group recommendations by title
Defender for Cloud's recommendation page allows you to group recommendations by title. This feature is useful when you want to remediate a recommendation that affects multiple resources due to a specific security issue.
To group recommendations by title:
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Manage recommendations assigned to you
Defender for Cloud supports governance rules for recommendations, to assign a recommendation owner or due date for action. Governance rules help ensure accountability and an SLA for recommendations.
Recommendations are listed asOn timeuntil their due date passes, when they're changed toOverdue.
Before the recommendation is overdue, it doesn't affect the secure score.
You can also apply a grace period during which overdue recommendations don't affect the secure score.

How are recommendations classified?
Every security recommendation from Defender for Cloud is given one of three severity ratings:
High severity: Address these recommendations immediately, as they indicate a critical security vulnerability that an attacker could exploit to gain unauthorized access to your systems or data. Examples of high severity recommendations include unprotected secrets on a machine, overly permissive inbound NSG rules, clusters allowing images to be deployed from untrusted registries, and unrestricted public access to storage accounts or databases.
High severity: Address these recommendations immediately, as they indicate a critical security vulnerability that an attacker could exploit to gain unauthorized access to your systems or data. Examples of high severity recommendations include unprotected secrets on a machine, overly permissive inbound NSG rules, clusters allowing images to be deployed from untrusted registries, and unrestricted public access to storage accounts or databases.
Medium severity: These recommendations indicate a potential security risk that should be addressed in a timely manner, but might not require immediate attention. Examples of medium severity recommendations include containers that share sensitive host namespaces, web apps that don't use managed identities, Linux machines that don't require SSH keys during authentication, and unused credentials left in the system after 90 days of inactivity.
Medium severity: These recommendations indicate a potential security risk that should be addressed in a timely manner, but might not require immediate attention. Examples of medium severity recommendations include containers that share sensitive host namespaces, web apps that don't use managed identities, Linux machines that don't require SSH keys during authentication, and unused credentials left in the system after 90 days of inactivity.
Low severity: These recommendations indicate a relatively minor security issue that can be addressed at your convenience. Examples of low severity recommendations include the need to disable local authentication in favor of Microsoft Entra ID, health issues with your endpoint protection solution, best practices not being followed with network security groups, or misconfigured logging settings that could make it harder to detect and respond to security incidents.
Low severity: These recommendations indicate a relatively minor security issue that can be addressed at your convenience. Examples of low severity recommendations include the need to disable local authentication in favor of Microsoft Entra ID, health issues with your endpoint protection solution, best practices not being followed with network security groups, or misconfigured logging settings that could make it harder to detect and respond to security incidents.
The internal views of an organization might differ from Microsoftâs classification of a specific recommendation. So, it's always a good idea to review each recommendation carefully and consider its potential effect on your security posture before deciding how to address it.
Note
Defender CSPM customers have access to a richer classification system where recommendations are shown a more dynamicRisk levelthat utilizes thecontextof the resource and all related resources. Learn more aboutrisk prioritization.
