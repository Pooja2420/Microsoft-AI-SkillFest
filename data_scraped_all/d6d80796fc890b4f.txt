This article explains how to use the Azure portal to move schedules and machines from Automation Update Management to Azure Update Manager. With minimal clicks and automated way to move your resources, it's the easiest way to move if you don't have customizations built on top of your Automation Update Management solution. For more details on what this portal tool is doing in the backend, please refer tomigration scripts
Azure portal experience
To access the portal migration experience, you can use several entry points.
Select theMigrate Nowbutton present on the following entry points. After the selection, you're guided through the process of moving your schedules and machines to Azure Update Manager. This process is designed to be user-friendly and straight forward to allow you to complete the migration with minimal effort.
You can migrate from any of the following entry points:
Automation Update Management
Azure Update Manager
Virtual machine
Select theMigrate Nowbutton.

The migration blade opens. It contains a summary of all resources including machines, and schedules in the Automation account. By default, the Automation account from which you accessed this blade is preselected if you go by this route.
Here, you can see how many of Azure, Arc-enabled servers, non-Azure non Arc-enabled servers, and schedules are enabled in Automation Update Management and need to be moved to Azure Update Manager. You can also view the details of these resources.

After you review the resources that must be moved, you can proceed with the migration process which is a three-step process:
PrerequisitesThis includes two steps:a.Onboard non-Azure non-Arc-enabled machines to Arc- This is because Arc connectivity is a prerequisite for Azure Update Manager. Onboarding your machines to Azure Arc is free of cost, and once you do so, you can avail all management services as you can do for any Azure machine. For more information, seeAzure Arc documentationon how to onboard your machines.b.Download and run PowerShell script locally-  This is required for the creation of a user identity and appropriate role assignments so that the migration can take place. This script gives proper RBAC to the User Identity on the subscription to which the automation account belongs, machines onboarded to Automation Update Management, scopes that are part of dynamic queries etc. so that the configuration can be assigned to the machines, MRP configurations can be created and updates solution can be removed.

Move resources in Automation account to Azure Update ManagerThe next step in the migration process is to enable Azure Update Manager on the machines to be moved and create equivalent maintenance configurations for the schedules to be migrated. When you select theMigrate Nowbutton, it imports theMigrateToAzureUpdateManagerrunbook into your Automation account and sets the verbose logging toTrue.SelectStartrunbook, which presents the parameters that must be passed to the runbook.For more information on the parameters to fetch and the location from where it must be fetched, seemigration of machines and schedules. Once you start the runbook after passing in all the parameters, Azure Update Manager will begin to get enabled on machines and maintenance configuration in Azure Update Manager will start getting created. You can monitor Azure runbook logs for the status of execution and migration of schedules.

You can initiate migration from Azure Update Manager. On the top of screen, you can see a deprecation banner with aMigrate Nowbutton at the top of screen.

SelectMigrate Nowbutton to view the migration blade that allows you to select the Automation account whose resources you want to move from Automation Update Management to Azure Update Manager. You must select subscription, resource group, and finally the Automation account name. After you select, you will view the summary of machines and schedules to be migrated to Azure Update Manager. From here, follow the migration steps listed inAutomation Update Management.
To initiate migration from a single VMUpdatesview, follow these steps:
Select the machine that is enabled for Automation Update Management and underOperations, selectUpdates.
Select the machine that is enabled for Automation Update Management and underOperations, selectUpdates.
In the deprecation banner, select theMigrate Nowbutton.You can see that the Automation account to which the machine belongs is preselected and a summary of all resources in the Automation account is presented. This allows you to migrate the resources from Automation Update Management to Azure Update Manager.
