Large deployments of multiple scale apps within a virtual network are at risk of subnet address space exhaustion. Subnets in your virtual networks can host many applications that need the ability to scale out. This featureAllowMultipleAddressPrefixesOnSubnetallows you to scale your virtual machines and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in subnets with ease. The feature eliminates the need to remove all resources from a subnet as a prerequisite for modifying its address prefixes.
AllowMultipleAddressPrefixesOnSubnet
Currently, Virtual Machine Scale Sets allows you to specify only one subnet. There isn't capability to extend subnet space or cross subnet boundaries. Virtual Machine Scale Sets can now take advantage of multiple address spaces when scaling up. If the first subnet is full, extra virtual machines spill over to subsequent subnets.
The following limitations apply during the public preview:
The feature only supports virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets and doesn't support Bare Metal or VNet injection for Containers, especially PodSubnet IPAM mode in AKS clusters. Any delegated subnet can't use this feature.

This feature doesn't support multiple customer address (CA) configurations. When using multiple prefixes on a subnet, you're only able to use a single customer address (CA) configuration. A single IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and single IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) address per NIC (network interface card) is supported.

Important
Multiple prefix support for Azure Virtual Network subnets is currently in public preview.
This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
For more information, seeSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.

An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Caution
Subnet properties "addressPrefixes" and "addressPrefix" are not to be used interchangeably. For best results, use only "addressPrefixes" for both a single address prefix and for multiple address prefixes. If you are already using "addressPrefix" in your workflows, continue to use this property.

To access the multiple subnet prefix preview feature you'll need to register it in your Azure subscription. For more information about registering preview features in your subscription, seeSet up preview features in Azure subscription.Azure Feature Exposure Control (AFEC) is available through the Microsoft.Features namespace. For this feature, two AFEC flags will need to be registered in your subscription:Microsoft.Features/providers/Microsoft.Network/features/AllowMultipleAddressPrefixesOnSubnetMicrosoft.Features/providers/Microsoft.Network/features/AllowDeletionOfIpPrefixFromSubnetTo register the feature, use the following commands:Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowMultipleAddressPrefixesOnSubnet -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
