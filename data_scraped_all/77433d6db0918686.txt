ExpressRoute Traffic Collector allows you to sample network flows over your ExpressRoute circuits. These flow logs are sent to an export destination for further analysis using custom log queries. Supported destinations includeLog Analytics,Event Hubs, and Storage Accounts. You can also export the data to any visualization tool or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) of your choice. Flow logs can be enabled for both private peering and Microsoft peering with ExpressRoute Traffic Collector.

Use cases
Flow logs provide insights into various traffic patterns. Common use cases include:
Network monitoring
Monitor Azure private peering and Microsoft peering traffic
Gain near real-time visibility into network throughput and performance
Perform network diagnosis
Forecast capacity needs
Monitor network usage and cost optimization
Analyze traffic trends by filtering sampled flows by IP, port, or applications
Identify top talkers for a source IP, destination IP, or applications
Optimize network traffic expenses by analyzing traffic trends
Network forensics analysis
Identify compromised IPs by analyzing associated network flows
Export flow logs to a SIEM tool to monitor, correlate events, and generate security alerts
Flow log collection and sampling
Flow logs are collected every 1 minute. All packets for a given flow are aggregated and imported into a Log Analytics workspace for analysis. ExpressRoute Traffic Collector uses a sampling rate of 1:4096, meaning 1 out of every 4,096 packets is captured. This sampling rate might result in short flows (in total bytes) not being collected. However, this doesn't affect network traffic analysis when sampled data is aggregated over a longer period. Flow collection time and sampling rate are fixed and can't be changed.
For more information, seeExpressRoute limitsfor the maximum number of flows.
Supported ExpressRoute circuits
ExpressRoute Traffic Collector supports both Provider-managed circuits and ExpressRoute Direct circuits. Currently, it only supports circuits with a bandwidth of 1Gbps or greater.
