Scalability and performance targets for standard storage accounts

This reference details scalability and performance targets for Azure Storage. The scalability and performance targets listed here are high-end targets, but are achievable. In all cases, the request rate and bandwidth achieved by your storage account depends upon the size of objects stored, the access patterns utilized, and the type of workload your application performs.
Make sure to test your service to determine whether its performance meets your requirements. If possible, avoid sudden spikes in the rate of traffic and ensure that traffic is well-distributed across partitions.
When your application reaches the limit of what a partition can handle for your workload, Azure Storage begins to return error code 503 (Server Busy) or error code 500 (Operation Timeout) responses. If 503 errors are occurring, consider modifying your application to use an exponential backoff policy for retries. The exponential backoff allows the load on the partition to decrease, and to ease out spikes in traffic to that partition.
The service-level agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage accounts is available atSLA for Storage Accounts.
Scale targets for standard storage accounts
The following table describes default limits for Azure general-purpose v2 (GPv2), general-purpose v1 (GPv1), and Blob storage accounts. Theingresslimit refers to all data that is sent to a storage account. Theegresslimit refers to all data that is received from a storage account.
Microsoft recommends that you use a GPv2 storage account for most scenarios. You can easily upgrade a GPv1 or a Blob storage account to a GPv2 account with no downtime and without the need to copy data. For more information, seeUpgrade to a GPv2 storage account.
Note
You can request higher capacity and ingress limits. To request an increase, contactAzure Support.

1With a quota increase, you can create up to 500 storage accounts with standard endpoints per region. For more information, seeIncrease Azure Storage account quotas.2Azure Storage standard accounts support higher capacity limits and higher limits for ingress and egress by request. To request an increase in account limits, contactAzure Support.
