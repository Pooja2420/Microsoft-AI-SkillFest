Using Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can help you understand your deployments of Azure Virtual Desktop. It can help with checks such as which client versions are connecting, opportunities for cost saving, or knowing if you have resource limitations or connectivity issues. If you make changes, you can continually validate that the changes have the intended effect, and iterate if needed. This article provides some use cases for Azure Virtual Desktop Insights and example scenarios using the Azure portal.
Prerequisites

Connectivity
Connectivity issues can have a severe impact on the quality and reliability of the end-user experience with Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can help you identify connectivity issues and understand where improvements can be made.
High latency
High latency can cause poor quality and slowness of a remote session. Maintaining ideal interaction times requires latency to generally be below 100 milliseconds, with a session broadly becoming of low quality over 200 ms. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can help pinpoint gateway regions and users impacted by latency by looking at theround-trip time, so that you can more easily find cases of user impact that are related to connectivity.
To view round-trip time:
Sign in to Azure Virtual Desktop Insights in the Azure portal by browsing tohttps://aka.ms/avdi.

Review the section forRound-trip timeand focus on the table forRTT by gateway regionand the graphRTT median and 95th percentile for all regions. In the example below, most median latencies are under the ideal threshold of 100 ms, but several are higher. In many cases, the 95th percentile (p95) is substantially higher than the median, meaning that there are some users experiencing periods of higher latency.TipYou can find a list of the gateway region codes and their corresponding Azure region atGateway region codes.

Tip
You can find a list of the gateway region codes and their corresponding Azure region atGateway region codes.
For the tableRTT by gateway region, selectMedian, until the arrow next to it points down, to sort by the median latency in descending order. This order highlights gateways your users are reaching with the highest latency that could be having the most impact. Select a gateway to view the graph of its RTT median and 95th percentile, and filter the list of 20 top users by RTT median to the specific region.In this example, theSANgateway region has the highest median latency, and the graph indicates that over time users are substantially over the threshold for poor connection quality.The list of users can be used to identify who is being impacted by these issues. You can select the magnifying glass icon in theDetailscolumn to drill down further into the data.

There are several possibilities for why latency might be higher than anticipated for some users, such as a poor Wi-Fi connection, or issues with their Internet Service Provider (ISP). However, with a list of impacted users, you have the ability to proactively contact and attempt to resolve end-user experience problems by understanding their network connectivity.
You should periodically review the round-trip time in your environment and the overall trend to identify potential performance concerns.
Connection reliability
The reliability of a connection can have a significant impact on the end-user experience. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can help you understand disconnection events and correlations between errors that affect end users.
Connection reliability provides two main views to help you understand the reliability of your connections:
A graph showing the number of disconnections over the concurrent connections in a given time range. This graph enables you to easily detect clusters of disconnects that are impacting connection reliability.

Session host performance
Issues with session hosts, such as where session hosts have too many sessions to cope with the workload end-users are running, can be a major cause of poor end-user experience. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can provide detailed information about resource utilization anduser input delayto allow you to more easily and quickly find if users are impacted by limitations for resources like CPU or memory.

Review the table forInput delay by hostand the graphMedian input delay over timeto find a summary of the median and 95th percentile user input delay values for each session host in the host pool. Ideally the user input delay for each host should be below 100 milliseconds, and a lower value is better.In the following example, the session hosts have a reasonable median user input delay, but occasionally values peak above the threshold of 100 ms, implying potential for impacting end-users.

If you find higher than expected user input delay (>100 ms), it can be useful to then look at the aggregated statistics for CPU, memory, and disk activity for the session hosts to see if there are periods of higher-than-expected utilization. The graphs forHost CPU and memory metrics,Host disk timing metrics, andHost disk queue lengthshow either the aggregate across session hosts, or a selected session host's resource metrics.In this example, there are some periods of higher disk read times that correlate with the higher user input delay.

In cases where a session host has extended periods of high resource utilization, itâs worth considering increasing theAzure VM sizeof the session host to better accommodate user workloads.
Client version usage
A common source of issues for end-users of Azure Virtual Desktop is using older clients that might either be missing new or updated features, or contain known issues that are resolved with more recent versions. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights contains a list of the different clients in use, and identifying clients that might be out of date.
To view a list of users with outdated clients:
Sign in to Azure Virtual Desktop Insights in the Azure portal by browsing tohttps://aka.ms/avdi.

Review the section forUsers with potentially outdated clients (all activity types). A summary table shows the highest version level of each client found connecting to your environment (marked asNewest) in the selected time range, and the count of users using outdated versions (in parentheses).In the below example, the newest version of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client for Windows (MSRDC) is 1.2.4487.0, and 993 users are currently using a version older. It also shows a count of connections and the number of days behind the latest version the older clients are.

You should periodically review the versions of clients in use to ensure your users are getting the best experience.
Note
Some clients, such as Windows App on iOS/iPadOS and Android are listed in the report with their build number, not their version number. You can match the build number to the version number in theAboutsection of Windows App settings.
Cost saving opportunities
Understanding the utilization of session hosts can help illustrate where there's potential to reduce spend by using a scaling plan, resize virtual machines, or reduce the number of session hosts in the pool. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can provide visibility into usage patterns to help you make the most informed decisions about how best to manage your resources based on real user usage.
Session host utilization
Knowing when your session hosts are in peak demand, or when there are few or no sessions can help you make decisions about how to manage your session hosts. You can useautoscaleto scale session hosts based on usage patterns. Azure Virtual Desktop Insights can help you identify broad patterns of user activity across multiple host pools. If you find opportunities to scale session hosts, you can use this information tocreate a scaling plan.

Review theSession historychart, which displays the number of active and idle (disconnected) sessions over time. Identify any periods of high activity, and periods of low activity from the peak user session count and the time period in which the peaks occur. If you find a regular, repeated pattern of activity, it usually implies there's a good opportunity to implement a scaling plan.In this example, the graph shows the number of users sessions over the course of a week. Peaks occur at around midday on weekdays, and there's a noticeable lack of activity over the weekend. This pattern suggests that there's an opportunity to scale session hosts to meet demand during the week, and reduce the number of session hosts over the weekend.

Use theSession host countchart to note the average number of active session hosts over time, and particularly the average number of session hosts that are idle (no sessions). Ideally session hosts should be actively supporting connected sessions and active workloads, and powered off when not in use by using a scaling plan. You'll likely need to keep a minimum number of session hosts powered on to ensure availability for users at irregular times, so understanding usage over time can help find an appropriate number of session hosts to keep powered on as a buffer.Even if a scaling plan is ultimately not a good fit for your usage patterns, there's still an opportunity to balance the total number of session hosts available as a buffer by analyzing the session demand and potentially reducing the number of idle devices.In this example, the graph shows there are long periods over the course of a week where idle session hosts are powered on and therefore increasing costs.

Use the drop-down lists to reduce the scope to a single host pool and repeat the analysis forsession historyandsession host count. At this scope, you can identify patterns that are specific to the session hosts in a particular host pool to help develop a scaling plan for that host pool.In this example, the first graph shows the pattern of user activity throughout a week between 6AM and 10PM. On the weekend, there's minimal activity. The second graph shows the number of active and idle session hosts throughout the same week. There are long periods of time where idle session hosts are powered on. Use this information to help determine optimal ramp-up and ramp-down times for a scaling plan.
