Learn about the different data protection and disaster recovery features in Azure NetApp Files to understand what solutions best serve your needs.
Snapshots
The foundation of data protection solutions including volume restores and clones and cross-region replication, Azure NetApp Files snapshot technology delivers stability, scalability, and swift recoverability without impacting performance.
Benefits
Efficient and frequent primary data protection for fast recovery from data corruption or loss
Revert a complete volume to a point-in-time snapshot in seconds
Restore a snapshot to new volume (clone) in seconds to test or develop with current data
Application-consistent snapshots withAzAcSnap integrationand third party backup tools
To learn more, seeHow Azure NetApp Files Snapshots workandWays to restore data from snapshots. To create a Snapshot policy, seeManage Snapshot policies in Azure NetApp Files.
Backups
Azure NetApp Files supports a fully managed backup solution for long-term recovery, archive, and compliance. Backups can be restored to new volumes in the same region as the backup. Backups created by Azure NetApp Files are stored in Azure storage, independent of volume snapshots that are available for near-term recovery or cloning.
Benefits
Increased productivity, reliably integrated service that is easy to manage and can be set once
Application-consistent backups withAzAcSnap integration
Retain daily, weekly, monthly backups for extended periods of time on cost-efficient cloud storage without media management
To learn more, seeHow snapshots can be vaulted for long-term retention and cost savings. To get started with backups, seeConfigure policy-based backups for Azure NetApp Files.
Cross-region replication
Using snapshot technology, you can replicate your Azure NetApp Files across designated Azure regions to protect your data from unforeseeable regional failures. Cross-region replication minimizes data transfer costs, replicating only changed blocks across regions while also enabling a lower restore point objective.
Benefits
Provides disaster recovery across regions
Data availability and redundancy for remote data processing and user access
Efficient storage-based data replication without load on compute infrastructure
To learn more, seeHow volumes and snapshots are replicated cross-region for DR. To get started with cross-region replication, seeCreate cross-region replication for Azure NetApp Files.
Cross-zone replication
Cross-zone replication leveragesavailability zonesand the same replication engine as cross-region replication. This technology creating a fast and cost-effective solution for you to asynchronously replicate volumes from availability zone to another without the need for host-based data replication.
Benefits
Data availability and redundancy across zones within regions
Bring data into same zone as compute for lowest latency-envelope
Efficient storage-based data replication without load on compute infrastructure
Lower TCO due to absence of data transfer fees
To learn more, seeUnderstand cross-zone replication. To get started with cross-zone replication, seeCreate cross-zone replication relationships for Azure NetApp Files.
