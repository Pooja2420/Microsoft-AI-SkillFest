When you apply metadata tags to your cloud resources, you can include information that the resource name doesn't include, like information about the asset. You can use that information to run sophisticated filtering and reporting on resources. Include context about the resource's associated workload or application, operational requirements, and ownership information. IT or business teams use this information to find resources or generate reports about resource usage and billing.
The required tags and optional tags that you apply to resources differs among organizations. The following list provides examples of common tags that capture important context and information about a resource. Use this list as a starting point to establish your own tagging conventions.
