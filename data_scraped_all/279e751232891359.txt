AnAzure Compute Gallery(formerly known as Shared Image Gallery) simplifies sharing resources, like images and application packages, across your organization.
The Azure Compute Gallery lets you share custom VM images and application packages with others in your organization, within or across regions, within a tenant. Choose what you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group resources.
The gallery is a top-level resource that can be shared in multiple ways:
Naming
Allowed characters for gallery name are uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters, digits (0-9), dots (or periods)., and underscores_. The gallery name can't contain dashes-. Gallery names must be unique within your subscription.

Sign in to theAzure portal.
TypeAzure Compute Galleryin the search box and selectAzure Compute Galleryin the results.
In theAzure Compute Gallerypage, selectAdd.
On theCreate Azure Compute Gallerypage, select the correct subscription.
InResource group, select a resource group from the drop-down or selectCreate newand type a name for the new resource group.
InName, type a name for the name of the gallery.
Select aRegionfrom the drop-down.
You can type a short description of the gallery, likeMy gallery for testing.and then clickReview + create.
After validation passes, selectCreate.
When the deployment is finished, selectGo to resource.
Create a gallery usingaz sig create. The following example creates a resource group named gallery namedmyGalleryRGinEast US, and a gallery namedmyGallery.
az group create --name myGalleryRG --location eastus
az sig create --resource-group myGalleryRG --gallery-name myGallery
az group create --name myGalleryRG --location eastus
az sig create --resource-group myGalleryRG --gallery-name myGallery
Create a gallery usingNew-AzGallery. The following example creates a gallery namedmyGalleryin themyGalleryRGresource group.
$resourceGroup = New-AzResourceGroup `
   -Name 'myGalleryRG' `
   -Location 'West Central US'	
$gallery = New-AzGallery `
   -GalleryName 'myGallery' `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName `
   -Location $resourceGroup.Location `
   -Description 'Azure Compute Gallery for my organization'
$resourceGroup = New-AzResourceGroup `
   -Name 'myGalleryRG' `
   -Location 'West Central US'	
$gallery = New-AzGallery `
   -GalleryName 'myGallery' `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName `
   -Location $resourceGroup.Location `
   -Description 'Azure Compute Gallery for my organization'

Create a direct shared gallery
Important
Azure Compute Gallery â direct shared gallery is currently in PREVIEW and subject to thePreview Terms for Azure Compute Gallery.
During the preview, you need to create a new gallery, with the propertysharingProfile.permissionsset toGroups. When using the CLI to create a gallery, use the--permissions groupsparameter. You can't use an existing gallery, the property can't currently be updated.

--permissions groups
You can't currently create a Flexible virtual machine scale set from an image shared to you by another tenant.
To start sharing a direct shared gallery with a subscription or tenant, seeShare a gallery with a subscription or tenant.

Create a community gallery
Acommunity galleryis shared publicly with everyone. To create a community gallery, you create the gallery first, then enable it for sharing. The name of public instance of your gallery is the prefix you provide, plus a unique GUID. Make sure that you create your gallery, image definitions, and image versions in the same region in order to share your gallery publicly.
When creating an image to share with the community, you need to provide contact information. This information is shownpublicly, so be careful when providing:
Community gallery prefix
Publisher support email
Publisher URL
Legal agreement URL
Information from your image definitions is also publicly available, like what you provide forPublisher,Offer, andSKU.
Prerequisites
Only the owner of a subscription, or a user or service principal assigned to theCompute Gallery Sharing Adminrole at the subscription or gallery level, can enable a gallery to go public to the community. To assign a role to a user, group, service principal or managed identity, seeSteps to assign an Azure role.

The--public-name-prefixvalue is used to create a name for the public version of your gallery. The--public-name-prefixis the first part of the public name, and the last part will be a GUID, created by the platform, that is unique to your gallery.
