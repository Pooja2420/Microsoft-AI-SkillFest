Built-in Azure RBAC roles for Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop uses Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to control access to resources. There are many built-in roles for use with Azure Virtual Desktop  that are a collection of permissions. You assign roles to users and admins and these roles give permission to carry out certain tasks. To learn more about Azure RBAC, seeWhat is Azure RBAC.
The standard built-in roles for Azure areOwner,Contributor, andReader. However, Azure Virtual Desktop has more roles that let you separate management roles for host pools, application groups, and workspaces. This separation lets you have more granular control over administrative tasks. These roles are named in compliance with Azure's standard roles and least-privilege methodology. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't have a specific Owner role, but you can use the general Owner role for the service objects.
The built-in roles for Azure Virtual Desktop and the permissions for each one are detailed in this article. You can assign each role to the scope you need. Some Azure Desktop features have specific requirements for the assigned scope, which you can find in the documentation for the relevant feature. For more information, seeUnderstand Azure role definitionsandUnderstand scope for Azure RBAC.
For a full list of all the built-in roles available, seeAzure built-in roles.

Desktop Virtualization User Session Operator
The Desktop Virtualization User Session Operator role allows sending messages, disconnecting sessions, and using thelogofffunction to sign users out of a session host. However, this role doesn't allow host pool or session host management like removing a session host, changing drain mode, and so on. This role can see assignments, but can't modify members. We recommend you assign this role to specific host pools. If you assign this role at a resource group level, it provides read permission on all host pools under a resource group.

Desktop Virtualization Session Host Operator
The Desktop Virtualization Session Host Operator role allows viewing and removing session hosts, and changing drain mode. This role can't add session hosts using the Azure portal because it doesn't have write permission for host pool objects. For adding session hosts outside of the Azure portal, if the registration token is valid (generated and not expired), this role can add session hosts to the host pool if theVirtual Machine Contributorrole is also assigned.
