AnAI enrichment pipelinecan include bothbuilt-in skillsandcustom skillsthat you personally create and publish. Your custom code executes externally from the search service (for example, as an Azure function), but accepts inputs and sends outputs to the skillset just like any other skill. Your data is processed in theGeowhere your model is deployed.
Custom skills might sound complex but can be simple and straightforward in terms of implementation. If you have existing packages that provide pattern matching or classification models, the content you extract from blobs could be passed to these models for processing. Since AI enrichment is Azure-based, your model should be on Azure also. Some common hosting methodologies include usingAzure FunctionsorContainers.
If you're building a custom skill, this article describes the interface you use to integrate the skill into the pipeline. The primary requirement is the ability to accept inputs and emit outputs in ways that are consumable within theskillsetas a whole. As such, the focus of this article is on the input and output formats that the enrichment pipeline requires.
Benefits of custom skills
Building a custom skill gives you a way to insert transformations unique to your content. For example, you could build custom classification models to differentiate business and financial contracts and documents, or add a speech recognition skill to reach deeper into audio files for relevant content. For a step-by-step example, seeExample: Creating a custom skill for AI enrichment.
Set the endpoint and time-out interval
The interface for a custom skill is specified through theCustom Web API skill.
"@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
"description": "This skill has a 230 second time-out",
"uri": "https://[your custom skill uri goes here]",
"authResourceId": "[for managed identity connections, your app's client ID goes here]",
"timeout": "PT230S",
"@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
"description": "This skill has a 230 second time-out",
"uri": "https://[your custom skill uri goes here]",
"authResourceId": "[for managed identity connections, your app's client ID goes here]",
"timeout": "PT230S",
The URI is the HTTPS endpoint of your function or app. When setting the URI, make sure the URI is secure (HTTPS). If your code is hosted in an Azure function app, the URI should include anAPI key in the header or as a URI parameterto authorize the request.
If instead your function or app uses Azure managed identities and Azure roles for authentication and authorization, the custom skill can include an authentication token on the request. The following points describe the requirements for this approach:
The search service, which sends the request on the indexer's behalf, must beconfigured to use a managed identity(either system or user-assigned) so that the caller can be authenticated by Microsoft Entra ID.

Your function or app must beconfigured for Microsoft Entra ID.

api://<appId>
By default, the connection to the endpoint times out if a response isn't returned within a 30-second window (PT30S). The indexing pipeline is synchronous and indexing will produce a time-out error if a response isn't received in that time frame. You can increase the interval to a maximum value of 230 seconds by setting thetimeoutparameter (PT230S).

Format Web API inputs
The Web API must accept an array of records to be processed. Within each record, provide a property bag as input to your Web API.
Suppose you want to create a basic enricher that identifies the first date mentioned in the text of a contract. In this example, the custom skill accepts a single input "contractText" as the contract text. The skill also has a single output, which is the date of the contract. To make the enricher more interesting, return this "contractDate" in the shape of a multipart complex type.
Your Web API should be ready to receive a batch of input records. Each member of the "values" array represents the input for a particular record. Each record is required to have the following elements:
A "recordId" member that is the unique identifier for a particular record. When your enricher returns the results, it must provide this "recordId" in order to allow the caller to match the record results to their input.
A "recordId" member that is the unique identifier for a particular record. When your enricher returns the results, it must provide this "recordId" in order to allow the caller to match the record results to their input.
A "data" member, which is essentially a bag of input fields for each record.
A "data" member, which is essentially a bag of input fields for each record.
The resulting Web API request might look like this:
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "a1",
        "data":
           {
             "contractText": 
                "This is a contract that was issues on November 3, 2023 and that involves... "
           }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "b5",
        "data":
           {
             "contractText": 
                "In the City of Seattle, WA on February 5, 2018 there was a decision made..."
           }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "c3",
        "data":
           {
             "contractText": null
           }
      }
    ]
}
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "a1",
        "data":
           {
             "contractText": 
                "This is a contract that was issues on November 3, 2023 and that involves... "
           }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "b5",
        "data":
           {
             "contractText": 
                "In the City of Seattle, WA on February 5, 2018 there was a decision made..."
           }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "c3",
        "data":
           {
             "contractText": null
           }
      }
    ]
}
In practice, your code can be called with hundreds or thousands of records instead of only the three shown here.
Format Web API outputs
The format of the output is a set of records containing a "recordId", and a property bag. This particular example has only one output, but you could output more than one property. As a best practice, consider returning error and warning messages if a record couldn't be processed.
{
  "values": 
  [
      {
        "recordId": "b5",
        "data" : 
        {
            "contractDate":  { "day" : 5, "month": 2, "year" : 2018 }
        }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "a1",
        "data" : {
            "contractDate": { "day" : 3, "month": 11, "year" : 2023 }                    
        }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "c3",
        "data" : 
        {
        },
        "errors": [ { "message": "contractText field required "}   ],  
        "warnings": [ {"message": "Date not found" }  ]
      }
    ]
}
{
  "values": 
  [
      {
        "recordId": "b5",
        "data" : 
        {
            "contractDate":  { "day" : 5, "month": 2, "year" : 2018 }
        }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "a1",
        "data" : {
            "contractDate": { "day" : 3, "month": 11, "year" : 2023 }                    
        }
      },
      {
        "recordId": "c3",
        "data" : 
        {
        },
        "errors": [ { "message": "contractText field required "}   ],  
        "warnings": [ {"message": "Date not found" }  ]
      }
    ]
}
Add a custom skill to a skillset
When you create a Web API enricher, you can describe HTTP headers and parameters as part of the request. The following snippet shows how request parameters and optional HTTP headers can be included in the skillset definition. Setting an HTTP header is useful if you need to pass configuration settings to your code.
{
    "skills": [
      {
        "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
        "name": "myCustomSkill",
        "description": "This skill calls an Azure function, which in turn calls TA sentiment",
        "uri": "https://indexer-e2e-webskill.azurewebsites.net/api/DateExtractor?language=en",
        "context": "/document",
        "httpHeaders": {
            "DateExtractor-Api-Key": "foo"
        },
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "contractText",
            "source": "/document/content"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [
          {
            "name": "contractDate",
            "targetName": "date"
          }
        ]
      }
  ]
}
{
    "skills": [
      {

        "context": "/document",
        "httpHeaders": {
            "DateExtractor-Api-Key": "foo"
        },
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "contractText",
            "source": "/document/content"

      }
  ]
