DoD IL4 overview
The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is an agency of the US Department of Defense (DoD) that is responsible for developing and maintaining the DoD Cloud ComputingSecurity Requirements Guide (SRG). The Cloud Computing SRG defines the baseline security requirements used by DoD to assess the security posture of a cloud service offering (CSO), supporting the decision to grant a DoD provisional authorization (PA) that allows a cloud service provider (CSP) to host DoD missions. It incorporates, supersedes, and rescinds the previously published DoD Cloud Security Model (CSM), and maps to the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF).
DISA guides DoD agencies and departments in planning and authorizing the use of a CSO. It also evaluates CSOs for compliance with the SRG â an authorization process whereby CSPs can furnish documentation outlining their compliance with DoD standards. It issues DoD provisional authorizations (PAs) when appropriate, so DoD agencies and supporting organizations can use cloud services without having to go through a full approval process on their own, saving time and effort.
According to Section 3.1.2 (Page 18) of theCloud Computing SRG, IL4 information covers controlled unclassified information (CUI), non-CUI information, non-critical mission information, and non-national security systems. TheCUI Registryprovides specific categories of information that is under protection by the Executive branch. For example, more than 20 category groupings are included in theCUI category list, such as:
Critical infrastructure (for example, Critical Energy Infrastructure Information)
Defense (for example, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information, Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information â Defense)
Export Control (for example,Export Administration Regulations (EAR)restrictions for items on theCommerce Control List, orInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)restrictions for items on theUS Munitions List)
Financial (for example, bank secrecy, budget, and so on)
Intelligence (for example, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)
Law enforcement (for example, criminal history records, accident investigations, and so on)
Nuclear (for example,Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Informationâ Energy)
Privacy (for example, military personnel records, health information, and so on)
And more
IL4 accommodates CUI categorizations based on theCommittee on National Security Systems Instruction No. 1253(CNSSI 1253)Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security Systemsup to moderate confidentiality and moderate integrity (M-M-x). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)SP 800-171Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizationsis intended for use by federal agencies in contracts or other agreements established with non-federal organizations.
The15 December 2014 DoD CIO memoregardingUpdated Guidance on the Acquisition and Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Servicesstates that âFedRAMP will serve as the minimum security baseline for all DoD cloud services.â The SRG uses the FedRAMP Moderate baseline at all information impact levels (IL) and considers the High Baseline at some.
Section 5.1.1DoD use of FedRAMP Security Controls(Page 37) of theCloud Computing SRGstates that a FedRAMP High provisional authorization will be accepted for a DoD IL4 PA without an assessment of extra controls and control enhancements (C/CE); however, assessment of non-C/CE based requirements in the Cloud Computing SRG is needed.
Section 5.6.2CSP Personnel Requirements(Page 76) additionally restricts CSP personnel having access to IL4 and IL5 data to US citizens, US nationals, or US persons. No foreign persons may have such access.
Azure and DoD IL4
Microsoft maintains the following authorizations for Azure Government regions US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, and US Gov Virginia:

DoD IL4 PA
DoD IL5 PA
For extra customer assistance, Microsoft provides the Azure Policy regulatory compliance built-in initiative for Azure Government, which maps to DoD IL4compliance domainsandcontrols:
DoD IL4 Azure Government regulatory compliance built-in initiative
Regulatory compliance in Azure Policy provides built-in initiative definitions to view a list of controls and compliance domains based on responsibility â customer, Microsoft, or shared. For Microsoft-responsible controls, we provide extra audit result details based on third-party attestations and our control implementation details to achieve that compliance. Each DoD IL4 control is associated with one or more Azure Policy definitions. These policies may help youassess compliancewith the control; however, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to more granular status.
