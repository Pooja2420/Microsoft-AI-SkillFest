Cognitive Services Face Recognizer
Lets you perform detect, verify, identify, group, and find similar operations on Face API. This role does not allow create or delete operations, which makes it well suited for endpoints that only need inferencing capabilities, following 'least privilege' best practices.
Performs liveness detection on a target face in a sequence of images of the same modality (e.g. color or infrared), and returns the liveness classification of the target face as either âreal faceâ, âspoof faceâ, or âuncertainâ if a classification cannot be made with the given inputs.
