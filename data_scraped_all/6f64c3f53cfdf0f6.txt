As part of your migration journey to Azure, you discover your on-premises inventory and workloads.
This tutorial shows you how to discover the servers that are running in your Hyper-V environment by using the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool, a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance. You deploy the appliance as a server on Hyper-V host, to continuously discover servers and their performance metadata, applications that are running on servers, server dependencies, web apps, and SQL Server instances and databases.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Set up an Azure account
Prepare the Hyper-V environment for discovery.
Create a project.
Set up the Azure Migrate appliance.
Start continuous discovery.
Note
Tutorials show the quickest path for trying out a scenario, and use default options.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, check you have these prerequisites in place.
Prepare an Azure user account
To create a project and register the Azure Migrate appliance, you need an account with:
Contributor or Owner permissions on an Azure subscription.
Permissions to register Microsoft Entra apps.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription. If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the permissions as follows:
In the Azure portal, search for "subscriptions", and underServices, selectSubscriptions.

Create an account to access servers
The user account on your servers must have the required permissions to initiate discovery of installed applications, agentless dependency analysis, and SQL Server instances and databases. You can provide the user account information in the appliance configuration manager. The appliance doesn't install agents on the servers.
To perform software inventory and agentless dependency analysis, create a guest user account (local or domain) on the servers. To perform web app discovery, you need an account with administrative permissions on the servers. To discover SQL Server instances and databases, the Windows or SQL Server account must be a member of the sysadmin server role or havethese permissionsfor each SQL Server instance. Learn how toassign the required role to the user account.
ForLinux servers, provide a sudo user account with permissions to execute ls and netstat commands or create a user account that has the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH and CAP_SYS_PTRACE permissions on /bin/netstat and /bin/ls files. If you're providing a sudo user account, ensure that you have enabledNOPASSWDfor the account to run the required commands without prompting for a password every time sudo command is invoked.
Note
You can add multiple server credentials in the Azure Migrate appliance configuration manager to initiate discovery of installed applications, agentless dependency analysis, and SQL Server instances and databases. You can add multiple domain, Windows (non-domain), Linux (non-domain), or SQL Server authentication credentials. Learn how toadd server credentials.

Set up the appliance
Azure Migrate uses a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance. The appliance performs server discovery and sends server configuration and performance metadata to Azure Migrate. The appliance can be set up by deploying a VHD file that can be downloaded from the project.
Note
If for some reason you can't set up the appliance using the template, you can set it up using a PowerShell script on an existing Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022.Learn more.
The option to deploy an appliance using a VHD template isn't supported in Azure Government cloud.Learn moreon how to deploy an appliance for Azure Government cloud.
This tutorial sets up the appliance on a server running in Hyper-V environment, as follows:
Provide an appliance name and generate a project key in the portal.
Download a compressed Hyper-V VHD from the Azure portal.
Create the appliance, and check that it can connect to Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment.
Configure the appliance for the first time, and register it with the project using the project key.
1. Generate the project key

Software inventoryidentifies the SQL Server instances that are running on the servers. Using the information it collects, the appliance attempts to connect to the SQL Server instances through the Windows authentication credentials or the SQL Server authentication credentials that are provided on the appliance. Then, it gathers data on SQL Server databases and their properties. The SQL Server discovery is performed once every 24 hours.

During software inventory, the added server credentials are iterated against servers and validated for agentless dependency analysis. When the discovery of servers is finished, in the portal, you can enable agentless dependency analysis on the servers. Only the servers on which validation succeeds can be selected to enableagentless dependency analysis.

By default, Azure Migrate uses the most secure way of connecting to SQL instances that is, Azure Migrate encrypts communication between the Azure Migrate appliance and the source SQL Server instances by setting the TrustServerCertificate property totrue. Additionally, the transport layer uses SSL to encrypt the channel and bypass the certificate chain to validate trust. Hence, the appliance server must be set up to trust the certificate's root authority. However, you can modify the connection settings, by selectingEdit SQL Server connection propertieson the appliance.Learn moreto understand what to choose.
