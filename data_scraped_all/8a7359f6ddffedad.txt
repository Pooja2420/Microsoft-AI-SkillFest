Prerequisites

Assign Basic or Basic + Test Plans
The easiest way to control paid access is to manually assign an access level. You can assign the access level when youadd a new user to your organization. Also,remove userswhen they leave your organization.
Keep the following information in mind:
Visual Studiosubscribers get detected automatically when they sign in. There's no extra charge for users with a Visual Studio subscription.
GitHub Enterpriseusers get detected automatically when they sign in. There's no extra charge for users with a GitHub Enterprise license.
Stakeholderaccess is afree access level with limited functionality.
Basicaccess is free for the first 5 users and paid for 6 or more users.
Basic + Test Plansaccess is paid only, butfree to try for 30 days.
Select default access level for new users
All new users get the free Stakeholder access if they're added directly to a project.
To change the access level for new users added to projects, do the following steps:
Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}).

Automate access with group rules
Group rules provide a great way to automate access level assignment for your organization. This way, you don't have to manually assign access each time a user gets added or removed. For more information, seeGroup rules.
Note
A group rule supersedes the default access level. For instance, if a user's part of a group  assigned theBasicaccess level, they getBasicaccess, even if the default access is set to Stakeholder. The default access level applies to users who aren't part of any group rules.
Reduce charges for users with no access
Billing stops automatically when users get removed from your organization or are assigned the free Stakeholder access level.
To find out if you have users who are no longer using Azure DevOps, do the following steps:
