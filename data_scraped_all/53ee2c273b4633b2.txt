Return up to the specified number of rows.
There is no guarantee which records are returned, unless
the source data is sorted. If the data is sorted, then the top values will be returned.
Thetakeandlimitoperators are equivalent
take
limit
Note
takeis a simple, quick, and efficient way to view a small sample of records when browsing data interactively, but be aware that it doesn't guarantee any consistency in its results when executing multiple times, even if the dataset hasn't changed.
Even if the number of rows returned by the query isn't explicitly limited by the query (notakeoperator is used), Kusto limits that number by default. For more details, seeKusto query limits.
