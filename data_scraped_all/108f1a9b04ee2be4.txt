Storage insights provides comprehensive monitoring of your Azure Storage accounts by delivering a unified view of your Azure Storage services performance, capacity, and availability. You can observe storage capacity, and performance in two ways, view directly from a storage account or view from Azure Monitor to see across groups of storage accounts.
This article will help you understand the experience Storage insights delivers to derive actionable knowledge on the health and performance of Storage accounts at scale, with a capability to focus on hotspots and diagnose latency, throttling, and availability issues.
Introduction to Storage insights
Before diving into the experience, you should understand how it presents and visualizes information. Whether you select the Storage feature directly from a storage account or from Azure Monitor, Storage insights presents a consistent experience.
Combined it delivers:
At scale perspectiveshowing a snapshot view of their availability based on the health of the storage service or the API operation, utilization showing total number of requests that the storage service receives, and latency showing the average time the storage service or API operation type is taking to process requests. You can also view capacity by blob, file, table, and queue.

This feature does not require you to enable or configure anything, the storage metrics from your storage accounts are collected by default. If you are unfamiliar with metrics available on Azure Storage, view the description and definition in Azure Storage metrics by reviewingAzure storage metrics.
Note
There is no charge to access this feature and you will only be charged for the Azure Monitor essential features you configure or enable, as described on theAzure Monitor pricing detailspage.
View from Azure Monitor
From Azure Monitor, you can view transaction, latency, and capacity details from multiple storage accounts in your subscription, and help identify performance, capacity problems, and failures.
To view the utilization and availability of your storage accounts across all of your subscriptions, perform the following steps.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
SelectMonitorfrom the left-hand pane in the Azure portal, and under theInsightssection, selectStorage Accounts.

Overview workbook
On theOverviewworkbook for the selected subscription, the table displays interactive storage metrics and service availability state for up to 5 storage accounts grouped within the subscription. You can filter the results based on the options you select from the following drop-down lists:
Subscriptions- only subscriptions that have storage accounts are listed.
Subscriptions- only subscriptions that have storage accounts are listed.
Storage Accounts- by default, 5 storage accounts are pre-selected. If you select all or multiple storage accounts in the scope selector, up to 200 storage accounts will be returned. For example, if you had a total of 573 storage accounts across three subscriptions that you've selected, only 200 accounts would be displayed.

The counter tile under the drop-down lists rolls-up the total number of storage accounts in the subscription and reflects how many of the total are selected. There is conditional color-coding or heatmaps for columns in the workbook that report transaction metrics or errors. The deepest color has the highest value and a lighter color is based on the lowest values. For the error-based columns, the value is in red and for the metric-based columns, the value is in blue.
Select a value in the columnsAvailability,E2E Latency,Server Latency, andtransaction error type/Errorsdirects you to a report tailored to the specific type of storage metrics that match the column selected for that storage account. For more information about the workbooks for each category, see theDetailed storage workbookssection below.
Note
For details on which errors can be shown in the report, seeResponse Type schemaand look for response types such asServerOtherError,ClientOtherError,ClientThrottlingError. Depending on the storage accounts selected, if there are more than three types of errors reported, all other errors are represented under the category ofOther.
The defaultAvailabilitythreshold is:
Warning - 99%
Critical - 90%
To set an availability threshold based on the results of your observation or requirements, reviewmodify the availability threshold.
Capacity workbook
SelectCapacityat the top of the page and theCapacityworkbook opens. It shows you the amount of total storage used in the account and capacity used by each data service in the account to help identify over and under utilized storage.

There is conditional color-coding or heatmaps for columns in the workbook that report capacity metrics with a blue value. The deepest color has the highest value and a lighter color is based on the lowest values.
When you select a value under any one of the columns in the workbook, you drill down to theCapacityworkbook for the storage account. Further details about the drill-down report are described in theDetailed storage workbookssection below.

Modify the availability threshold
In this example, we are working with the storage account capacity workbook and demonstrating how to modify the availability threshold. By default, the tile and grid reporting percent availability are configured with a minimum threshold of 90 and maximum threshold of 99. We are going to change the minimum threshold value of theAvailability %in theAvailability by API namegrid to 85%, which means the health state changes to critical if the threshold is less than 85 percent.

Troubleshooting
For general troubleshooting guidance, refer to the dedicated workbook-based insightstroubleshooting article.
This section will help you with the diagnosis and troubleshooting of some of the common issues you may encounter when using Storage insights. Use the list below to locate the information relevant to your specific issue.
Resolving performance, capacity, or availability issues
To help troubleshoot any storage-related issues you identify with Storage insights, see the Azure Storagetroubleshooting guidance.
Why can I only see 200 storage accounts?
The number of selected storage accounts has a limit of 200, regardless of the number of subscriptions that are selected.
How to change the coloring and threshold for availability?
Refer to theModify the availability thresholdsection for the detailed steps on how to change the coloring and thresholds for availability.
How to analyze and troubleshoot the data shown in Storage insights?
Refer to theMonitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Storagearticle for details on how to analyze and troubleshoot the Azure Storage data shown in Storage insights.
Why don't I see all the types of errors in metrics?
Currently, up to three different types of errors are shown and the rest of the errors are grouped together in a single bucket. It is controlled using splitByLimit and can be modified. For changing this property:
Click on edit workbook.
Click on edit workbook.
Go to metrics, click on edit and then selectTransactions, Sumor whatever metrics you want to edit.
Go to metrics, click on edit and then selectTransactions, Sumor whatever metrics you want to edit.

Then change the Number of Splits.
Then change the Number of Splits.

If you want to see n different types of error than specify splitByLimit as n+1, 1 extra for rest of the errors.
I saved my workbook while on some Storage Account. Why can't I find it now?
Each workbook is saved in the storage account that you saved it in. Try to find the specific Storage Account in which the user saved the workbook. Otherwise, there is no way to find a specific workbook without knowing the resource (storage account).
