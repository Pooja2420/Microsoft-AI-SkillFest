Symbol servers enable debuggers to automatically retrieve the correct symbol files without knowing product names, build numbers or package names. These files contain useful information for the debugger and generally have thePDBextension. You can use Visual Studio to consume your symbols from Azure Artifacts symbol server or other external sources to step into your code and debug your application.
Add Azure Artifacts symbol server
To debug with symbols from the Azure Artifacts symbol server, we must authenticate to the server and add a new Azure DevOps Services symbol server to our Visual Studio environment.
From Visual Studio, selectTools>Options>Debugging.

Debug optimized modules
If you're planning to debug an optimized module (example release binaries) or a third-party source code, we recommend that you uncheck theEnable Just My Codecheckbox in Visual Studio options.
Enable Just My Code
To do so, selectTools>Optionsand thenDebugging. SelectGeneralfrom the list and then uncheckEnable Just My Code.

Note
To enable support for portable PDB files, check theEnable Source Link Supportcheckbox, and to enable support for Windows PDB files on symbol servers, check theEnable Source Server Supportcheckbox, both located underTools>Options>Debugging>General.
Start debugging
You can start debugging your application in a few different ways:
PressF5to start the app with the debugger attached to the app process.
SelectDebug>Start Debugging.
Select theStart Debuggingbutton in the debug toolbar.
When you start the debugger, Visual Studio will attempt to load your symbols from the cache folder first before downloading them from the Artifacts symbol server that we added in the previous section.
Once Visual Studio finds and loads your symbols, you should be able to step through your code and debug your application. SeeNavigate through code with the Visual Studio debuggerfor more details.
