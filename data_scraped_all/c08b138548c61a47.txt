Azure IoT Hub enables a number of building blocks likedevice twin properties and tagsanddirect methods. Typically, back-end apps enable device administrators and operators to update and interact with IoT devices in bulk and at a scheduled time. Jobs execute device twin updates and direct methods against a set of devices at a scheduled time. For example, an operator would use a back-end app that initiates and tracks a job to reboot a set of devices in building 43 and floor 3 at a time that would not be disruptive to the operations of the building.
Note
The features described in this article are available only in the standard tier of IoT Hub. For more information about the basic and standard/free IoT Hub tiers, seeChoose the right IoT Hub tier and size for your solution.
Consider using jobs when you need to schedule and track progress any of the following activities on a set of devices:
Update desired properties
Update tags
Invoke direct methods
Job lifecycle
Jobs are initiated by the solution back end and maintained by IoT Hub. You can initiate a job through a service-facing URI (PUT https://<iot hub>/jobs/v2/<jobID>?api-version=2021-04-12) and query for progress on an executing job through a service-facing URI (GET https://<iot hub>/jobs/v2/<jobID?api-version=2021-04-12). To refresh the status of running jobs once a job is initiated, run a job query. There is no explicit purge of job history, but they have a TTL of 30 days.
PUT https://<iot hub>/jobs/v2/<jobID>?api-version=2021-04-12
GET https://<iot hub>/jobs/v2/<jobID?api-version=2021-04-12
Note
When you initiate a job, property names and values can only contain US-ASCII printable alphanumeric, except any in the following set:$ ( ) < > @ , ; : \ " / [ ] ? = { } SP HT
$ ( ) < > @ , ; : \ " / [ ] ? = { } SP HT
Note
ThejobIdfield must be 64 characters or less and can only contain US-ASCII letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.

Jobs to execute direct methods
The following snippet shows the HTTPS 1.1 request details for executing adirect methodon a set of devices using a job:
PUT /jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2021-04-12

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "jobId": "<jobId>",
    "type": "scheduleDeviceMethod",
    "cloudToDeviceMethod": {
        "methodName": "<methodName>",
        "payload": <payload>,
        "responseTimeoutInSeconds": methodTimeoutInSeconds
    },
    "queryCondition": "<queryOrDevices>", // query condition
    "startTime": <jobStartTime>,          // as an ISO-8601 date string
    "maxExecutionTimeInSeconds": <maxExecutionTimeInSeconds>
}
PUT /jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2021-04-12

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "jobId": "<jobId>",
    "type": "scheduleDeviceMethod",
    "cloudToDeviceMethod": {
        "methodName": "<methodName>",
        "payload": <payload>,
        "responseTimeoutInSeconds": methodTimeoutInSeconds
    },
    "queryCondition": "<queryOrDevices>", // query condition
    "startTime": <jobStartTime>,          // as an ISO-8601 date string
    "maxExecutionTimeInSeconds": <maxExecutionTimeInSeconds>
}
The query condition can also be on a single device ID or on a list of device IDs as shown in the following examples:
"queryCondition" = "deviceId = 'MyDevice1'"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1','MyDevice2']"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1']"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId = 'MyDevice1'"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1','MyDevice2']"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1']"

Querying for progress on jobs
The following snippet shows the HTTPS 1.1 request details for querying for jobs:
GET /jobs/v2/query?api-version=2021-04-12[&jobType=<jobType>][&jobStatus=<jobStatus>][&pageSize=<pageSize>][&continuationToken=<continuationToken>]

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
GET /jobs/v2/query?api-version=2021-04-12[&jobType=<jobType>][&jobStatus=<jobStatus>][&pageSize=<pageSize>][&continuationToken=<continuationToken>]

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
The continuationToken is provided from the response.
You can query for the job execution status on each device using theIoT Hub query language for device twins, jobs, and message routing.
Jobs Properties
The following list shows the properties and corresponding descriptions, which can be used when querying for jobs or job results.
