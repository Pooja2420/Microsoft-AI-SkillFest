IP-based connection lets you connect to your on-premises, non-Azure, and Azure virtual machines via Azure Bastion over ExpressRoute or a VPN site-to-site connection using a specified private IP address. The steps in this article show you how to configure your Bastion deployment, and then connect to an on-premises resource using IP-based connection. For more information about Azure Bastion, see theOverview.

Note
This configuration requires the Standard SKU tier or higher for Azure Bastion. To upgrade, seeUpgrade a SKU.
Limitations
IP-based connection wonât work with force tunneling over VPN, or when a default route is advertised over an ExpressRoute circuit. Azure Bastion requires access to the Internet and force tunneling, or the default route advertisement will result in traffic blackholing.

Prerequisites
Before you begin these steps, verify that you have the following environment set up:
A VNet with Bastion already deployed.Make sure that you have deployed Bastion to the virtual network. Once the Bastion service is provisioned and deployed in your virtual network, you can use it to connect to any VM deployed in any of the virtual networks that is reachable from Bastion.To deploy Bastion, seeQuickstart: Deploy Bastion with default settings and the Standard SKU.

Connect to VM - native client
You can connect to VMs using a specified IP address with native client via SSH, RDP, or tunneling. To learn more about configuring native client support, seeConfigure Bastion native client support.
Note
This feature does not currently support Microsoft Entra authentication or custom port and protocol.
Use the following commands as examples:
RDP:
az network bastion rdp --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>
az network bastion rdp --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>
SSH:
az network bastion ssh --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>" --auth-type "ssh-key" --username "<Username>" --ssh-key "<Filepath>"
az network bastion ssh --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>" --auth-type "ssh-key" --username "<Username>" --ssh-key "<Filepath>"
Tunnel:
az network bastion tunnel --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>" --resource-port "<TargetVMPort>" --port "<LocalMachinePort>"
az network bastion tunnel --name "<BastionName>" --resource-group "<ResourceGroupName>" --target-ip-address "<VMIPAddress>" --resource-port "<TargetVMPort>" --port "<LocalMachinePort>"
