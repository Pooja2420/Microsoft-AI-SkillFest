If you frequently use the portal to deploy Linux VMs, you can simplify using SSH keys by integrating them into Azure. There are several ways to create SSH keys for use with Azure.
You can create SSH keys when you first create a VM. Your keys aren't tied to a specific VM and you can use them in future applications.

Connect to the VM
On your local computer, open a PowerShell prompt and type:
ssh -i <path to the .pem file> username@<ipaddress of the VM>
ssh -i <path to the .pem file> username@<ipaddress of the VM>
For example, type:ssh -i /Downloads/mySSHKey.pem azureuser@123.45.67.890and replace the example IP address at the end of the command with your VM'spublic IP address.
ssh -i /Downloads/mySSHKey.pem azureuser@123.45.67.890
Upload an SSH key
You can also upload a public SSH key to store in Azure. For information about how to create an SSH key pair, seeUse SSH keys to connect to Linux VMs.
