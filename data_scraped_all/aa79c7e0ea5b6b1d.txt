Note
Diagnostic tools often provide better insight into the root cause of a problem when the latest stable SDK version is used.
SDK update guidance
Support engineers are expected to provide SDK update guidance according to the following table, referencing the current SDK version in use and any alternatives.
Note
General Availability (GA) refers to non-beta versions.
Preview refers to beta versions.
Tip
Switching toautoinstrumentationeliminates the need for manual SDK updates.
Warning
Only commercially reasonable support is provided for Preview versions of the SDK. If a support incident requires escalation to development for further guidance, customers will be asked to use a fully supported SDK version to continue support. Commercially reasonable support does not include an option to engage Microsoft product development resources; technical workarounds may be limited or not possible.
