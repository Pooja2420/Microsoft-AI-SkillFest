You can provide others access to the billing information for your account in the Azure portal. The type of billing roles and the instructions to provide access to the billing information vary by the type of your billing account. To determine the type of your billing account, seeCheck the type of your billing account.
The article applies to customers with Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) accounts. If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA) and are the Enterprise Administrator, you can give permissions to the Department Administrators and Account Owners in the Azure portal. For more information, seeUnderstand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure. If you're a Microsoft Customer Agreement customer, see,Understand Microsoft Customer Agreement administrative roles in Azure.
Account administrators for Microsoft Online Service program accounts
By default, the Account Administrator is the only owner for an MOSP billing account. When a user creates an MOSP subscription, they get the Account Administrator role for the subscription. They also get the Azure Role-based access control (RBAC) Owner role for it. The role is assigned to a person who signed up for Azure. Account Administrators are authorized to perform various billing tasks like create subscriptions, view invoices or change the billing for a subscription.
Give others access to view billing information
Account administrator can grant others access to Azure billing information by assigning one of the following roles on a subscription in their account.
Owner
Contributor
Reader
Billing Reader
These roles have access to billing information in theAzure portal. People that are assigned these roles can also use theCost Management APIsto programmatically get invoices and usage details.
To assign roles, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
Note
If you're an EA customer, an Account Owner can assign the above role to other users of their team. But for these users to view billing information, the Enterprise Administrator must enable AO view charges in the Azure portal.
Allow users to download invoices
After an Account administrator assigns the appropriate roles to other users, they must turn on access to download invoices in the Azure portal. Invoices older than December 2016 are available only to the Account Administrator.
Sign in to theAzure portal, as an Account Administrator,
Search onCost Management + Billing.
In the left navigation menu, selectSubscriptions. Depending on your access, you might need to select a billing scope and then selectSubscriptions.
In the left navigation menu, selectInvoices.

Give read-only access to billing
Assign the Billing Reader role to someone that needs read-only access to the subscription billing information but not the ability to manage or create Azure services. This role is appropriate for users in an organization who are responsible for the financial and cost management for Azure subscriptions.
