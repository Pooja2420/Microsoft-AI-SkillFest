Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with SAP NetWeaver
Article

In this article
In this article,  you learn how to integrate SAP NetWeaver with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SAP NetWeaver with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:
Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SAP NetWeaver.
Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SAP NetWeaver with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
Manage your accounts in one central location.
Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:
A Microsoft Entra user account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you canCreate an account for free.
One of the following roles:Application AdministratorCloud Application AdministratorApplication Owner.
Application Administrator
Cloud Application Administrator
Application Owner.
SAP NetWeaver single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
SAP NetWeaver V7.20 or later
Scenario description
SAP NetWeaver supports bothSAML(SP initiated SSO) andOAuth. In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.
Note
Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.
Note
Configure the application either in SAML or in OAuth as per your organizational requirement.
Adding SAP NetWeaver from the gallery
To configure the integration of SAP NetWeaver into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SAP NetWeaver from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aCloud Application Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Enterprise apps>New application.
In theAdd from the gallerysection, typeSAP NetWeaverin the search box.
SelectSAP NetWeaverfrom results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.
Alternatively, you can also use theEnterprise App Configuration Wizard. In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SAP NetWeaver
Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP NetWeaver using a test user calledB.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SAP NetWeaver.
To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP NetWeaver, perform the following steps:
Configure Microsoft Entra SSOto enable your users to use this feature.Create a Microsoft Entra test userto test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.Assign the Microsoft Entra test userto enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
Create a Microsoft Entra test userto test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
Assign the Microsoft Entra test userto enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
Configure SAP NetWeaver using SAMLto configure the SSO settings on application side.Create SAP NetWeaver test userto have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP NetWeaver that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
Create SAP NetWeaver test userto have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP NetWeaver that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
Test SSOto verify whether the configuration works.
Configure SAP NetWeaver for OAuthâto configure the OAuth settings on application side.
Request Access Token from Microsoft Entra IDto use Microsoft Entra ID as the Identity Provider (IdP).

Configure Microsoft Entra SSO
In this section, you enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
To configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on with SAP NetWeaver, perform the following steps:
Open a new web browser window and sign into your SAP NetWeaver company site as an administrator

Generating Service Provider Metadata:- Once we're done with configuring theLocal ProviderandTrusted Providerssettings on SAML 2.0 User Interface, the next step would be to generate the service providerâs metadata file (which would contain all the settings, authentication contexts, and other configurations in SAP). Once this file is generated, upload this file to Microsoft Entra ID.Go toLocal Provider tab.SelectMetadata.Save the generatedMetadata XML fileon your computer and upload it inBasic SAML Configurationsection to autopopulate theIdentifierandReply URLvalues in Azure portal.

Therefore, for our example, we're going to register an OAuth 2.0 client with name CLIENT1. As a prerequisite, a user with the same name (CLIENT1) must exist in the SAP system and that user we will configure to be used by the referred application.

Request Access Token from Microsoft Entra ID
To request an access token from the SAP system using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) as the Identity Provider (IdP), follow these steps:
Step 1: Register Application in Microsoft Entra ID
Log into the Azure portal: Navigate to the Azure portal atportal.azure.com.
Register a new application:Go to "Microsoft Entra ID".Select "App registrations" > "New registration".Fill in the application details such as Name, Redirect URI, etc.Select "Register".
Go to "Microsoft Entra ID".
Select "App registrations" > "New registration".
Fill in the application details such as Name, Redirect URI, etc.
Select "Register".
Configure API permissions:After registration, navigate to "API permissions".Select "Add a permission" and select "APIs my organization uses".Search for the SAP system or relevant API and add the necessary permissions.Grant admin consent for the permissions.
After registration, navigate to "API permissions".
Select "Add a permission" and select "APIs my organization uses".
Search for the SAP system or relevant API and add the necessary permissions.
Grant admin consent for the permissions.
Step 2: Create Client Secret
Navigate to the registered application: Go to "Certificates & secrets".
Create a new client secret:Select "New client secret".Provide a description and set an expiry period.Select "Add" and note down the client secret value as it's needed for authentication.
Select "New client secret".
Provide a description and set an expiry period.
Select "Add" and note down the client secret value as it's needed for authentication.
Step 3: Configure SAP System for Microsoft Entra ID Integration
Access SAP Cloud Platform: Log into your SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit.
Set up trust configuration:Go to "Security" > "Trust Configuration".Add Microsoft Entra ID as a trusted IdP by importing the federation metadata XML from Microsoft Entra ID. This can be found in the "Endpoints" section of the Microsoft Entra ID app registration (under Federation Metadata Document).
Go to "Security" > "Trust Configuration".
Add Microsoft Entra ID as a trusted IdP by importing the federation metadata XML from Microsoft Entra ID. This can be found in the "Endpoints" section of the Microsoft Entra ID app registration (under Federation Metadata Document).
Configure OAuth2 client:In the SAP system, configure an OAuth2 client using the client ID and client secret obtained from Microsoft Entra ID.Set the token endpoint and other relevant OAuth2 parameters.
In the SAP system, configure an OAuth2 client using the client ID and client secret obtained from Microsoft Entra ID.
Set the token endpoint and other relevant OAuth2 parameters.
Step 4: Request Access Token
Tip
Consider using Azure API Management to streamline the SAP Principal Propagation process for all client apps in Azure, Power Platform, Microsoft 365 and more, in a single place including smart token caching, secure token handling and governance options like request throttling.Learn more about SAP Principal Propagation with Azure API Management. In case SAP Business Technology Platform is preferred, seethis article.
Prepare the token request:Construct a token request using the following details:Token Endpoint: This is typicallyhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token.Client ID: The Application (client) ID from Microsoft Entra ID.Client Secret: The client secret value from Microsoft Entra ID.Scope: The required scopes (e.g.,https://your-sap-system.com/.default).Grant Type: Useclient_credentialsfor server-to-server authentication.
