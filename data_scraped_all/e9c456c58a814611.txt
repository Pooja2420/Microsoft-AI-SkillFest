Using device bound Entra tokens in Azure DevOps

Bearer tokens are common in modern identity flows. When a user logs into Azure DevOps, the web client acquires an OAuth 2.0 access token, a type of bearer token from Entra using Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). This token is stored in the user's browser cache. However, they are vulnerable to being stolen from token caches.Proof-of-Possession (PoP)or device bound tokens help reduce this risk by tying this token to the client device using a public/private key pair. Microsoft Entra adds the public key to the token, and the client signs it with the private keyâresulting in two digital signatures: one from Entra and one from the client. This offers two key protections:
Token cache safety. The local browser cache doesnât store fully signedPoP tokens.Tokens are signed only when needed, so stolen cache tokens canât be used without the private key which are hardware-protected in most cases.
Man-in-the-middle protection. The protocol also prevents replay or interception attacks from man-in-the-middle attacks.
Azure DevOps will upgrade the access tokens used in the web client to device bound tokens to protect users against token theft.
