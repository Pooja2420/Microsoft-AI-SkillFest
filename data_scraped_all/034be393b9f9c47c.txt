Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides security recommendations to improve organizational security posture and reduce risk. An important element in risk reduction is machine hardening.
Defender for Cloud assesses operating system settings against compute security baselines provided by theMicrosoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB). Machine information is gathered for assessment using the Azure Policy machine configuration extension (formerly known as the guest configuration) on the machine.Learn more
This article describes how to review recommendations made by the assessment.
Prerequisites
This feature previously used the Log Analytics agent (also known as the Microsoft Monitoring agent (MMA)) to collect information. If you still have the MMA in use, you might receive duplicate recommendations for the same machine. To avoid this, you candisable the MMA on the machine.

Query recommendations
Defender for Cloud usesAzure Resource Graphfor API, and portal queries, to query recommendation information. You can utilize these resources to create your own queries to retrieve information.
You can learn how toreview recommendations in Azure Resource Graph.
Here are two sample queries you can use:
Query all unhealthy rules for a specific resourceSecurityresources 
| where type == "microsoft.security/assessments/subassessments" 
| extend assessmentKey=extract(@"(?i)providers/Microsoft.Security/assessments/([^/]*)", 1, id)
