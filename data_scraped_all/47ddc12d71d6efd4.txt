This article describes some common solutions for issues related to Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).
Azure role assignments
Symptom - Add role assignment option is disabled
You're unable to assign a role in the Azure portal onAccess control (IAM)because theAdd>Add role assignmentoption is disabled
Cause
You're currently signed in with a user that doesn't have permission to assign roles at the selected scope.
Solution
Check that you're currently signed in with a user that is assigned a role that has theMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermission such asRole Based Access Control Administratorat the scope you're trying to assign the role.
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Symptom - Roles or principals are not listed
When you try to assign a role in the Azure portal, some roles or principals are not listed. For example, on theRoletab, you see a reduced set of roles.

Or, on theSelect memberspane, you see a reduced set of principals.

Cause
There are restrictions on the role assignments you can add. For example, you are constrained in the roles that you can assign or constrained in the principals you can assign roles to.
Solution
View theroles assigned to you. Check if there is a condition that constrains the role assignments you can add. For more information, seeDelegate Azure access management to others.

Symptom - Unable to assign a role
You are unable to assign a role and you get an error similar to the following:
Failed to add {securityPrincipal} as {role} for {scope} : The client '{clientName}' with object id '{objectId}' does not have authorization or an ABAC condition not fulfilled to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' over scope '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}' or the scope is invalid. If access was recently granted, please refresh your credentials.
Failed to add {securityPrincipal} as {role} for {scope} : The client '{clientName}' with object id '{objectId}' does not have authorization or an ABAC condition not fulfilled to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' over scope '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}' or the scope is invalid. If access was recently granted, please refresh your credentials.
Cause 1
You are currently signed in with a user that does not have permission to assign roles at the selected scope.
Solution 1
Check that you are currently signed in with a user that is assigned a role that has theMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermission such asRole Based Access Control Administratorat the scope you are trying to assign the role.
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Cause 2
There are restrictions on the role assignments you can add. For example, you are constrained in the roles that you can assign or constrained in the principals you can assign roles to.
Solution 2
View theroles assigned to you. Check if there is a condition that constrains the role assignments you can add. For more information, seeDelegate Azure access management to others.

Symptom - Unable to assign a role using a service principal with Azure CLI
You're using a service principal to assign roles with Azure CLI and you get the following error:
Insufficient privileges to complete the operation
Insufficient privileges to complete the operation
For example, let's say that you have a service principal that has been assigned the Owner role and you try to create the following role assignment as the service principal using Azure CLI:
az login --service-principal --username "SPNid" --password "password" --tenant "tenantid"
az role assignment create --assignee "userupn" --role "Contributor"  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}"
az login --service-principal --username "SPNid" --password "password" --tenant "tenantid"
az role assignment create --assignee "userupn" --role "Contributor"  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}"
Cause
It's likely Azure CLI is attempting to look up the assignee identity in Microsoft Entra ID and the service principal can't read Microsoft Entra ID by default.
Solution
There are two ways to potentially resolve this error. The first way is to assign theDirectory Readersrole to the service principal so that it can read data in the directory.
The second way to resolve this error is to create the role assignment by using the--assignee-object-idparameter instead of--assignee. By using--assignee-object-id, Azure CLI will skip the Microsoft Entra lookup. You'll need to get the object ID of the user, group, or application that you want to assign the role to. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using Azure CLI.
--assignee-object-id
--assignee
--assignee-object-id
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111  --role "Contributor" --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}"
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111  --role "Contributor" --scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}"
Symptom - Assigning a role to a new principal sometimes fails
You create a new user, group, or service principal and immediately try to assign a role to that principal and the role assignment sometimes fails. You get a message similar to following error:
PrincipalNotFound
Principal {principalId} does not exist in the directory {tenantId}. Check that you have the correct principal ID. If you are creating this principal and then immediately assigning a role, this error might be related to a replication delay. In this case, set the role assignment principalType property to a value, such as ServicePrincipal, User, or Group.  See https://aka.ms/docs-principaltype
PrincipalNotFound
Principal {principalId} does not exist in the directory {tenantId}. Check that you have the correct principal ID. If you are creating this principal and then immediately assigning a role, this error might be related to a replication delay. In this case, set the role assignment principalType property to a value, such as ServicePrincipal, User, or Group.  See https://aka.ms/docs-principaltype
Cause
The reason is likely a replication delay. The principal is created in one region; however, the role assignment might occur in a different region that hasn't replicated the principal yet.
Solution 1
If you're creating a new user or service principal using the REST API or ARM template, set theprincipalTypeproperty when creating the role assignment using theRole Assignments - CreateAPI.
principalType
User
2020-03-01-preview
ServicePrincipal
2018-09-01-preview
For more information, seeAssign Azure roles to a new service principal using the REST APIorAssign Azure roles to a new service principal using Azure Resource Manager templates.
Solution 2
If you're creating a new user or service principal using Azure PowerShell, set theObjectTypeparameter toUserorServicePrincipalwhen creating the role assignment usingNew-AzRoleAssignment. The same underlying API version restrictions of Solution 1 still apply. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using Azure PowerShell.
ObjectType
User
ServicePrincipal
Solution 3
If you're creating a new group, wait a few minutes before creating the role assignment.
Symptom - ARM template role assignment returns BadRequest status
When you try to deploy a Bicep file or ARM template that assigns a role to a service principal you get the error:
Tenant ID, application ID, principal ID, and scope are not allowed to be updated. (code: RoleAssignmentUpdateNotPermitted)
Tenant ID, application ID, principal ID, and scope are not allowed to be updated. (code: RoleAssignmentUpdateNotPermitted)
For example, if you create a role assignment for a managed identity, then you delete the managed identity and recreate it, the new managed identity has a different principal ID. If you try to deploy the role assignment again and use the same role assignment name, the deployment fails.
Cause
The role assignmentnameisn't unique, and it's viewed as an update.
name
Role assignments are uniquely identified by their name, which is a globally unique identifier (GUID). You can't create two role assignments with the same name, even in different Azure subscriptions. You also can't change the properties of an existing role assignment.
Solution
Provide an idempotent unique value for the role assignmentname. It's a good practice to create a GUID that uses the scope, principal ID, and role ID together. It's a good idea to use theguid()function to help you to create a deterministic GUID for your role assignment names, like in this example:
name
guid()
Bicep
ARM template
resource roleAssignment 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2020-10-01-preview' = {
  name: guid(resourceGroup().id, principalId, roleDefinitionId)
  properties: {
    roleDefinitionId: roleDefinitionId
    principalId: principalId
    principalType: principalType
  }
}
resource roleAssignment 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2020-10-01-preview' = {
  name: guid(resourceGroup().id, principalId, roleDefinitionId)
  properties: {
    roleDefinitionId: roleDefinitionId
    principalId: principalId
    principalType: principalType
  }
}
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
  "apiVersion": "2020-10-01-preview",
  "name": "[guid(resourceGroup().id, variables('principalId'), variables('roleDefinitionId'))]",
  "properties": {
    "roleDefinitionId": "[variables('roleDefinitionId')]",
    "principalId": "[variables('principalId')]",
    "principalType": "[variables('principalType')]"
  }
}
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
  "apiVersion": "2020-10-01-preview",
  "name": "[guid(resourceGroup().id, variables('principalId'), variables('roleDefinitionId'))]",
  "properties": {
    "roleDefinitionId": "[variables('roleDefinitionId')]",
    "principalId": "[variables('principalId')]",
    "principalType": "[variables('principalType')]"
  }
}
For more information, seeCreate Azure RBAC resources by using Bicep.
Symptom - Role assignments with identity not found
In the list of role assignments for the Azure portal, you notice that the security principal (user, group, service principal, or managed identity) is listed asIdentity not foundwith anUnknowntype.

If you list this role assignment using Azure PowerShell, you might see an emptyDisplayNameandSignInName, or a value forObjectTypeofUnknown. For example,Get-AzRoleAssignmentreturns a role assignment that is similar to the following output:
DisplayName
SignInName
ObjectType
Unknown
RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222

ObjectType         : User
CanDelegate        : False
Similarly, if you list this role assignment using Azure CLI, you might see an emptyprincipalName. For example,az role assignment listreturns a role assignment that is similar to the following output:
principalName
{
    "canDelegate": null,
    "id": "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
    "name": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
    "principalId": "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333",
    "principalName": "",
    "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe",
    "roleDefinitionName": "Storage Blob Data Contributor",

    "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments"
}
{
    "canDelegate": null,
    "id": "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",

    "principalId": "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333",
    "principalName": "",
    "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe",
    "roleDefinitionName": "Storage Blob Data Contributor",
    "scope": "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments"
}
Cause 1
You recently invited a user when creating a role assignment and this security principal is still in the replication process across regions.
Solution 1
Wait a few moments and refresh the role assignments list.
Cause 2
You deleted a security principal that had a role assignment. If you assign a role to a security principal and then you later delete that security principal without first removing the role assignment, the security principal will be listed asIdentity not foundand anUnknowntype.
Solution 2
It isn't a problem to leave these role assignments where the security principal has been deleted. If you like, you can remove these role assignments using steps that are similar to other role assignments. For information about how to remove role assignments, seeRemove Azure role assignments.
In PowerShell, if you try to remove the role assignments using the object ID and role definition name, and more than one role assignment matches your parameters, you'll get the error message:The provided information does not map to a role assignment. The following output shows an example of the error message:
The provided information does not map to a role assignment

Symptom - Cannot delete the last Owner role assignment
You attempt to remove the last Owner role assignment for a subscription and you see the following error:
Cannot delete the last RBAC admin assignment
Cannot delete the last RBAC admin assignment
Cause
Removing the last Owner role assignment for a subscription isn't supported to avoid orphaning the subscription.
Solution
If you want to cancel your subscription, seeCancel your Azure subscription.
You're allowed to remove the last Owner (or User Access Administrator) role assignment at subscription scope, if you're a Global Administrator for the tenant or a classic administrator (Service Administrator or Co-Administrator) for the subscription. In this case, there's no constraint for deletion. However, if the call comes from some other principal, then you won't be able to remove the last Owner role assignment at subscription scope.
Symptom - Role assignment isn't moved after moving a resource
Cause
If you move a resource that has an Azure role assigned directly to the resource (or a child resource), the role assignment isn't moved and becomes orphaned.
Solution
After you move a resource, you must re-create the role assignment. Eventually, the orphaned role assignment will be automatically removed, but it's a best practice to remove the role assignment before moving the resource. For information about how to move resources, seeMove resources to a new resource group or subscription.
Symptom - Role assignment changes are not being detected
You recently added or updated a role assignment, but the changes aren't being detected. You might see the messageStatus: 401 (Unauthorized).
Status: 401 (Unauthorized)
Cause 1
Azure Resource Manager sometimes caches configurations and data to improve performance.
Solution 1
When you assign roles or remove role assignments, it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to take effect. If you're using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI, you can force a refresh of your role assignment changes by signing out and signing in. If you're making role assignment changes with REST API calls, you can force a refresh by refreshing your access token.
Cause 2
You added managed identities to a group and assigned a role to that group. The back-end services for managed identities maintain a cache per resource URI for around 24 hours.
Solution 2
It can take several hours for changes to a managed identity's group or role membership to take effect. For more information, seeLimitation of using managed identities for authorization.
Symptom - Role assignment changes at management group scope are not being detected
You recently added or updated a role assignment at management group scope, but the changes are not being detected.
Cause
Azure Resource Manager sometimes caches configurations and data to improve performance.
Solution
When you assign roles or remove role assignments, it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to take effect. If you add or remove a built-in role assignment at management group scope and the built-in role hasDataActions, the access on the data plane might not be updated for several hours. This applies only to management group scope and the data plane. Custom roles withDataActionscan't be assigned at the management group scope.
DataActions
DataActions
Symptom - Role assignments for management group changes are not being detected
You created a new child management group and the role assignment on the parent management group is not being detected for the child management group.
Cause
Azure Resource Manager sometimes caches configurations and data to improve performance.
Solution
It can take up to 10 minutes for the role assignment for the child management group to take effect. If you are using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI, you can force a refresh of your role assignment changes by signing out and signing in. If you are making role assignment changes with REST API calls, you can force a refresh by refreshing your access token.
Symptom - Removing role assignments using PowerShell takes several minutes
You use theRemove-AzRoleAssignmentcommand to remove a role assignment. You then use theGet-AzRoleAssignmentcommand to verify the role assignment was removed for a security principal. For example:
Get-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $securityPrincipalObject.Id
Get-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $securityPrincipalObject.Id
TheGet-AzRoleAssignmentcommand indicates that the role assignment wasn't removed. However, if you wait 5-10 minutes and runGet-AzRoleAssignmentagain, the output indicates the role assignment was removed.
Cause
The role assignment has been removed. However, to improve performance, PowerShell uses a cache when listing role assignments. There can be delay of around 10 minutes for the cache to be refreshed.
Solution
Instead of listing the role assignments for a security principal, list all the role assignments at the subscription scope and filter the output. For example, the following command:
$validateRemovedRoles = Get-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $securityPrincipalObject.Id
$validateRemovedRoles = Get-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $securityPrincipalObject.Id
Can be replaced with this command instead:
$validateRemovedRoles = Get-AzRoleAssignment -Scope /subscriptions/$subId | Where-Object -Property ObjectId -EQ $securityPrincipalObject.Id
$validateRemovedRoles = Get-AzRoleAssignment -Scope /subscriptions/$subId | Where-Object -Property ObjectId -EQ $securityPrincipalObject.Id
Custom roles
Symptom - Unable to update or delete a custom role
You're unable to update or delete an existing custom role.
Cause 1
You're currently signed in with a user that doesn't have permission to update or delete custom roles.
Solution 1
Check that you're currently signed in with a user that is assigned a role that has theMicrosoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/writepermission such asUser Access Administrator.
Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write
Cause 2
The custom role includes a subscription in assignable scopes and that subscription is in adisabled state.
Solution 2
Reactivate the disabled subscription and update the custom role as needed. For more information, seeReactivate a disabled Azure subscription.
Symptom - Unable to create or update a custom role
When you try to create or update a custom role, you get an error similar to following:
The client '<clientName>' with object id '<objectId>' has permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write' on scope '/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>'; however, it does not have permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write' on the linked scope(s)'/subscriptions/<subscriptionId1>,/subscriptions/<subscriptionId2>,/subscriptions/<subscriptionId3>' or the linked scope(s)are invalid
The client '<clientName>' with object id '<objectId>' has permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write' on scope '/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>'; however, it does not have permission to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write' on the linked scope(s)'/subscriptions/<subscriptionId1>,/subscriptions/<subscriptionId2>,/subscriptions/<subscriptionId3>' or the linked scope(s)are invalid
Cause
This error usually indicates that you don't have permissions to one or more of theassignable scopesin the custom role.
Solution
Try the following:
ReviewWho can create, delete, update, or view a custom roleand check that you have permissions to create or update the custom role for all assignable scopes.
If you don't have permissions, ask your administrator to assign you a role that has theMicrosoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/writeaction, such asUser Access Administrator, at the scope of the assignable scope.
Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write
Check that all the assignable scopes in the custom role are valid. If not, remove any invalid assignable scopes.
For more information, see the custom role tutorials using theAzure portal,Azure PowerShell, orAzure CLI.
Symptom - Unable to delete a custom role
You're unable to delete a custom role and get the following error message:
There are existing role assignments referencing role (code: RoleDefinitionHasAssignments)
There are existing role assignments referencing role (code: RoleDefinitionHasAssignments)
Cause
There are role assignments still using the custom role.
Solution
Remove the role assignments that use the custom role and try to delete the custom role again. For more information, seeFind role assignments to delete a custom role.
Symptom - Unable to add more than one management group as assignable scope
When you try to create or update a custom role, you can't add more than one management group as assignable scope.
Cause
You can define only one management group inAssignableScopesof a custom role.
AssignableScopes
Solution
Define one management group inAssignableScopesof your custom role. For more information about custom roles and management groups, seeOrganize your resources with Azure management groups.
AssignableScopes
Symptom - Unable to add data actions to custom role
When you try to create or update a custom role, you can't add data actions or you see the following message:
You cannot add data action permissions when you have a management group as an assignable scope
You cannot add data action permissions when you have a management group as an assignable scope
Cause
You're trying to create a custom role with data actions and a management group as assignable scope. Custom roles withDataActionscan't be assigned at the management group scope.
DataActions
Solution
Create the custom role with one or more subscriptions as the assignable scope. For more information about custom roles and management groups, seeOrganize your resources with Azure management groups.
Access denied or permission errors
Symptom - Authorization failed
When you try to create a resource, you get the following error message:
The client with object id does not have authorization to perform action over scope (code: AuthorizationFailed)
The client with object id does not have authorization to perform action over scope (code: AuthorizationFailed)
Cause 1
You're currently signed in with a user that doesn't have write permission to the resource at the selected scope.
Solution 1
Check that you're currently signed in with a user that is assigned a role that has write permission to the resource at the selected scope. For example, to manage virtual machines in a resource group, you should have theVirtual Machine Contributorrole on the resource group (or parent scope). For a list of the permissions for each built-in role, seeAzure built-in roles.
Cause 2
The currently signed in user has a role assignment with the following criteria:
Role includes aMicrosoft.Storagedata action
Role assignment includes an ABAC condition that uses aGUID comparison operators
Solution 2
At this time, you can't have a role assignment with a Microsoft.Storage data action and an ABAC condition that uses a GUID comparison operator. Here are a couple of options to resolve this error:
If the role is a custom role, remove any Microsoft.Storage data actions
Modify the role assignment condition so that it does not use GUID comparison operators
Symptom - Guest user gets authorization failed
When a guest user tries to access a resource, they get an error message similar to the following:
The client '<client>' with object id '<objectId>' does not have authorization to perform action '<action>' over scope '<scope>' or the scope is invalid.
The client '<client>' with object id '<objectId>' does not have authorization to perform action '<action>' over scope '<scope>' or the scope is invalid.
Cause
The guest user doesn't have permissions to the resource at the selected scope.
Solution
Check that the guest user is assigned a role with least privileged permissions to the resource at the selected scope. For more information,Assign Azure roles to external users using the Azure portal.
Symptom - Unable to create a support request
When you try to create or update a support ticket, you get the following error message:
You don't have permission to create a support request
You don't have permission to create a support request
Cause
You're currently signed in with a user that doesn't have permission to create support requests.
Solution
Check that you're currently signed in with a user that is assigned a role that has theMicrosoft.Support/supportTickets/writepermission, such asSupport Request Contributor.
Microsoft.Support/supportTickets/write
Azure features are disabled
Symptom - Some web app features are disabled
A user has read access to a web app and some features are disabled.
Cause
If you grant a user read access to a web app, some features are disabled that you might not expect. The following management capabilities require write access to a web app and aren't available in any read-only scenario.
Commands (like start, stop, etc.)
Changing settings like general configuration, scale settings, backup settings, and monitoring settings
Accessing publishing credentials and other secrets like app settings and connection strings
Streaming logs
Resource logs configuration
Console (command prompt)
Active and recent deployments (for local git continuous deployment)
Estimated spend
Web tests
Virtual network (only visible to a reader if a virtual network has previously been configured by a user with write access).
Solution
Assign theContributoror anotherAzure built-in rolewith write permissions for the web app.
Symptom - Some web app resources are disabled
A user has write access to a web app and some features are disabled.
Cause
Web apps are complicated by the presence of a few different resources that interplay. Here's a typical resource group with a couple of websites:

As a result, if you grant someone access to just the web app, much of the functionality on the website blade in the Azure portal is disabled.
These items require write access to theApp Service plan that corresponds to your website:
Viewing the web app's pricing tier (Free or Standard)
Scale configuration (number of instances, virtual machine size, autoscale settings)
Quotas (storage, bandwidth, CPU)
These items requirewriteaccess to the wholeResource groupthat contains your website:
TLS/SSL Certificates and bindings (TLS/SSL certificates can be shared between sites in the same resource group and geo-location)

Symptom - Some virtual machine features are disabled
A user has access to a virtual machine and some features are disabled.
Cause
Similar to web apps, some features on the virtual machine blade require write access to the virtual machine, or to other resources in the resource group.
Virtual machines are related to Domain names, virtual networks, storage accounts, and alert rules.
These items require write access to the virtual machine:
Endpoints
IP addresses
Disks
Extensions
These require write access to both the virtual machine, and the resource group (along with the Domain name) that it is in:
Availability set
Load balanced set
Alert rules
If you can't access any of these tiles, ask your administrator for Contributor access to the Resource group.
Solution
Assign anAzure built-in rolewith write permissions for the virtual machine or resource group.
