When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Load Testing.
Azure Load Testing creates monitoring data usingAzure Monitor, which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure. Azure Monitor provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources. It can also monitor resources in other clouds and on-premises. Learn more aboutmonitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor.
Tip
To understand costs associated with Azure Monitor, seeUsage and estimated costs. To understand the time it takes for your data to appear in Azure Monitor, seeLog data ingestion time.
Monitoring data
Azure Load Testing collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described inMonitoring data from Azure resources.
SeeMonitor Azure Load Testing data referencefor detailed information on logs metrics created by Azure Load Testing.
Collection and routing
Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting. Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.
SeeCreate diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azurefor the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect.
The log categories for Azure Load Testing are listed inMonitor Azure Load Testing data reference.
Analyzing logs
Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties. All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined inAzure Monitor resource log schema.
You can find the schema for Azure Load Testing resource logs in theMonitor Azure Load Testing data reference.
TheActivity logis a type of Azure platform log that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.
For a list of resource logs types collected for Azure Load Testing, seeMonitor Azure Load Testing data reference.
Sample Kusto queries
Important
When you selectLogsfrom the Azure Load Testing menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current [service name]. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other [service resource] or data from other Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu. SeeLog query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analyticsfor details.
Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your Azure Load Testing resources:
Retrieve the list of tests:AzureLoadTestingOperation
| where OperationId == "Test_CreateOrUpdateTest"
| where HttpStatusCode == 201
| summarize count() by _ResourceId
Retrieve the list of tests:

| where OperationId == "Test_CreateOrUpdateTest"
| where HttpStatusCode == 201
| summarize count() by _ResourceId
Retrieve the list of test runs:AzureLoadTestingOperation
| where OperationId == "TestRun_CreateAndUpdateTest"
| where HttpStatusCode == 201
| summarize count() by _ResourceId
Retrieve the list of test runs:
