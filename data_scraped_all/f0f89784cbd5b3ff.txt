TheAzure Site Recoveryservice contributes to your disaster recovery strategy by managing and orchestrating replication, failover, and failback of on-premises machines, and Azure virtual machines (VMs).
This tutorial shows how to set up disaster recovery of on-premises physical Windows and Linux servers to Azure. In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a Recovery Services vault for Site Recovery
Create a replication policy
Enable replication for a server
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial:
Make sure you understand thearchitecture and componentsfor this scenario.
Review thesupport requirementsfor all components.
Make sure that the servers you want to replicate comply withAzure VM requirements.
Prepare Azure. You need an Azure subscription, an Azure virtual network, and a storage account.
Prepare an account for automatic installation of the Mobility service on each server you want to replicate.
Before you begin, note that:
After failover to Azure, physical servers can't be failed back to on-premises physical machines. You can only fail back to VMware VMs.
This tutorial sets up physical server disaster recovery to Azure with the simplest settings. If you want to learn about other options, read through our How To guides:Set up thereplication source, including the Site Recovery configuration server.Set up thereplication target.Configure areplication policy, andenable replication.
Set up thereplication source, including the Site Recovery configuration server.
Set up thereplication target.
Configure areplication policy, andenable replication.
Set up an Azure account
Get a MicrosoftAzure account.
You can start with afree trial.
Learn aboutSite Recovery pricing, and getpricing details.
Find out whichregions are supportedfor Site Recovery.
Verify Azure account permissions
Make sure your Azure account has permissions for replication of VMs to Azure.
Review thepermissionsyou need to replicate machines to Azure.
Verify and modifyAzure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)permissions.
Set up an Azure network
Set up anAzure network.
Azure VMs are placed in this network when they're created after failover.
The network should be in the same region as the Recovery Services vault
Set up an Azure storage account
Set up anAzure storage account.
Site Recovery replicates on-premises machines to Azure storage. Azure VMs are created from the storage after failover occurs.
The storage account must be in the same region as the Recovery Services vault.
Prepare an account for Mobility service installation
The Mobility service must be installed on each server you want to replicate. Site Recovery installs this service automatically when you enable replication for the server. To install automatically, you need to use theroot/adminaccount that Site Recovery will utilize to access the server.
You can use a domain or local account for Windows VMs
For Windows VMs, if you're not using a domain account, disable Remote User Access control on the local machine. To do this, in the register underHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System, add the DWORD entryLocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, with a value of 1.
To add the registry entry to disable the setting from a CLI, type:REG ADD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1.
REG ADD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1.
For Linux, the account should berooton the source Linux server.

Prepare infrastructure
it's important to prepare the infrastructure before you set up disaster recovery of physical VMware machines to Azure.
Deployment planning
In theAzure portal, go toRecovery Services vaultsand select the vault.
On the vault home page, selectEnable Site Recovery.
Navigate to the bottom of the page, and selectPrepare infrastructureunder theVMware machines to Azuresection. This opens the Prepare infrastructure pane.
In thePrepare infrastructurepane, underDeployment planningtab do the following:
Tip
If you're planning a large deployment, download the Deployment Planner for Hyper-V from the link on the page.
For this tutorial, we don't need the Deployment Planner. InDeployment planning completed?, selectI will do it later.
SelectNext.
Source settings
On theSource settingstab, do the following:
Select if your machines are virtual or physical in theAre your machines virtualized?option. For this tutorial, selectNo.
UnderConfiguration Server, specify the server you want to use. If you don't have a configuration server ready, you can use theAdd Configuration Serveroption.
On theAdd Serverpane, do the following:If youâre enabling protection for virtual machines, then download the Configuration server virtual machine template.Learn more.If youâre enabling protection for physical machines, then download the Site Recovery Unified Setup installation file. You will also need to download the vault registration key. You need it when you run Unified Setup. The key is valid for five days after you generate it.Learn more.

Register the configuration server in the vault
Do the following before you start:
On the configuration server machine, make sure that the system clock is synchronized with aTime Server. It should match. If it's 15 minutes in front or behind, setup might fail.
Make sure the machine can access these URLs based on your environment:
login.microsoftonline.com
login.microsoftonline.us
*.backup.windowsazure.com
*.backup.windowsazure.us
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.us
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net
dc.services.visualstudio.com
dc.services.visualstudio.com
time.windows.com
time.nist.gov
IP address-based firewall rules should allow communication to all of the Azure URLs that are listed above over HTTPS (443) port. To simplify and limit the IP Ranges, it's recommended that URL filtering is done.
Commercial IPs- Allow theAzure Datacenter IP Ranges, and the HTTPS (443) port. Allow IP address ranges for the Azure region of your subscription to support the Microsoft Entra ID, Backup, Replication, and Storage URLs.
Government IPs- Allow theAzure Government Datacenter IP Ranges, and the HTTPS (443) port for all USGov Regions (Virginia, Texas, Arizona, and Iowa) to support Microsoft Entra ID, Backup, Replication, and Storage URLs.
Run Unified Setup as a Local Administrator, to install the configuration server. The process server and the master target server are also installed by default on the configuration server.
Run the Unified Setup installation file.
Run the Unified Setup installation file.
InBefore You Begin, selectInstall the configuration server and process server.

InNetwork Selection, first select the NIC that the in-built process server uses for discovery and push installation of mobility service on source machines, and then select the NIC that Configuration Server uses for connectivity with Azure. Port 9443 is the default port used for sending and receiving replication traffic, but you can modify this port number to suit your environment's requirements. In addition to the port 9443, we also open port 443, which is used by a web server to orchestrate replication operations. Do not use port 443 for sending or receiving replication traffic.
