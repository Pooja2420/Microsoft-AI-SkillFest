Azure Red Hat OpenShift is a managed OpenShift service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. This article shows you how to deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster using either Azure CLI or the Azure portal.
Azure CLI
Azure portal
Before you begin
Ensure you're using Azure CLI version 2.67.0 or higher. Useaz --versionto find the version of Azure CLI you have installed. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure CLI.
az --version
Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription doesn't meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, seeStandard quota: Increase limits by VM series.
For example, to check the current subscription quota of the smallest supported virtual machine family SKU "Standard DSv3":LOCATION=eastus
az vm list-usage -l $LOCATION \
--query "[?contains(name.value, 'standardDSv3Family')]" \
-o table
For example, to check the current subscription quota of the smallest supported virtual machine family SKU "Standard DSv3":
LOCATION=eastus
az vm list-usage -l $LOCATION \
--query "[?contains(name.value, 'standardDSv3Family')]" \
-o table
LOCATION=eastus
az vm list-usage -l $LOCATION \
--query "[?contains(name.value, 'standardDSv3Family')]" \
-o table
Verify your permissions
In this article, you'll create a resource group which contains the virtual network for the cluster. To do this, you'll need Contributor and User Access Administrator permissions or Owner permissions, either directly on the virtual network or on the resource group or subscription containing it.
You'll also need sufficient Microsoft Entra permissions (either a member user of the tenant, or a guest assigned with roleApplication administrator) for the tooling to create an application and service principal on your behalf for the cluster. SeeMember and guestsandAssign administrator and non-administrator roles to users with Microsoft Entra IDfor more details.
Register the resource providers
If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, specify the relevant subscription ID:az account set --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION ID>
If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, specify the relevant subscription ID:

Get a Red Hat pull secret (optional)
Note
ARO pull secret doesn't change the cost of the RH OpenShift license for ARO.
A Red Hat pull secret enables your cluster to access Red Hat container registries, along with other content such as operators fromOperatorHub. This step is optional but recommended. If you decide to add the pull secret later, followthis guidance. The fieldcloud.openshift.comis removed from your secret even if your pull-secret contains that field. This field enables an extra monitoring feature, which sends data to RedHat and is thus disabled by default. To enable this feature, seehttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/support/remote_health_monitoring/enabling-remote-health-reporting.html.
cloud.openshift.com
Navigate to your Red Hat OpenShift cluster manager portaland sign-in.You'll need to log in to your Red Hat account or create a new Red Hat account with your business email and accept the terms and conditions.

If you're copying your pull secret or referencing it in other scripts, your pull secret should be formatted as a valid JSON string.
Prepare a custom domain for your cluster (optional)
When running theaz aro createcommand, you can specify a custom domain for your cluster by using the--domain foo.example.comparameter.
az aro create
--domain foo.example.com
Note
Although adding a domain name is optional when creating a cluster through Azure CLI, a domain name (or a prefix used as part of the auto-generated DNS name for OpenShift console and API servers) is needed when adding a cluster through the portal. SeeQuickstart: Deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster using the Azure portalfor more information.
If you provide a custom domain for your cluster, note the following points:
After creating your cluster, you must create two DNS A records in your DNS server for the--domainspecified:api- pointing to the api server IP address*.apps- pointing to the ingress IP addressRetrieve these values by executing the following command after cluster creation:az aro show -n -g --query '{api:apiserverProfile.ip, ingress:ingressProfiles[0].ip}'.
After creating your cluster, you must create two DNS A records in your DNS server for the--domainspecified:
--domain
api- pointing to the api server IP address
*.apps- pointing to the ingress IP address
Retrieve these values by executing the following command after cluster creation:az aro show -n -g --query '{api:apiserverProfile.ip, ingress:ingressProfiles[0].ip}'.
az aro show -n -g --query '{api:apiserverProfile.ip, ingress:ingressProfiles[0].ip}'
The OpenShift console will be available at a URL such ashttps://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com, instead of the built-in domainhttps://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io.
The OpenShift console will be available at a URL such ashttps://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com, instead of the built-in domainhttps://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io.
https://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com
https://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io
By default, OpenShift uses self-signed certificates for all of the routes created on custom domains*.apps.example.com.  If you choose to use custom DNS after connecting to the cluster, you will need to follow the OpenShift documentation toconfigure a custom CA for your ingress controllerand acustom CA for your API server.

Create a virtual network containing two empty subnets
Next, you'll create a virtual network containing two empty subnets. If you have existing virtual network that meets your needs, you can skip this step.

Create a resource group.An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you're asked to specify a location. This location is where resource group metadata is stored, and it is also where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation. Create a resource group using theaz group createcommand.NoteAzure Red Hat OpenShift is not available in all regions where an Azure resource group can be created. SeeAvailable regionsfor information on where Azure Red Hat OpenShift is supported.az group create \
  --name $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --location $LOCATIONThe following example output shows the resource group created successfully:{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/aro-rg",

Create a virtual network.Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters running OpenShift 4 require a virtual network with two empty subnets, for the master and worker nodes. You can either create a new virtual network for this, or use an existing virtual network.Create a new virtual network in the same resource group you created earlier:az network vnet create \
   --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
   --name aro-vnet \
   --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/22The following example output shows the virtual network created successfully:{

  }
}
Create a virtual network.
Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters running OpenShift 4 require a virtual network with two empty subnets, for the master and worker nodes. You can either create a new virtual network for this, or use an existing virtual network.
Create a new virtual network in the same resource group you created earlier:
az network vnet create \
   --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
   --name aro-vnet \
   --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/22
az network vnet create \
   --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
   --name aro-vnet \
   --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/22
The following example output shows the virtual network created successfully:
{
  "newVNet": {

  }
}
Add an empty subnet for the master nodes.az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name master-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/23
Add an empty subnet for the master nodes.
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name master-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/23
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name master-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/23
Add an empty subnet for the worker nodes.az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name worker-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/23
Add an empty subnet for the worker nodes.
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name worker-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/23
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --vnet-name aro-vnet \
  --name worker-subnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/23
Create the cluster
Run the following command to create a cluster. If you choose to use either of the following options, modify the command accordingly:
Optionally, you canpass your Red Hat pull secret, which enables your cluster to access Red Hat container registries along with other content. Add the--pull-secret @pull-secret.txtargument to your command.
--pull-secret @pull-secret.txt
Optionally, you canuse a custom domain. Add the--domain foo.example.comargument to your command, replacingfoo.example.comwith your own custom domain.
--domain foo.example.com
foo.example.com
Note
The maximum number of worker nodes definable at creation time is 50. You can scale out up to 250 nodes after the cluster is created.
az aro create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name $CLUSTER \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet
az aro create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name $CLUSTER \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet
After executing theaz aro createcommand, it normally takes about 45 minutes to create a cluster.
az aro create
If you are looking to deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster with more than 100 worker nodes please see theDeploy a large Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster
You can select to use a specific version of ARO when creating your cluster. First, use the CLI to query for available ARO versions:
az aro get-versions --location <region>
az aro get-versions --location <region>
Once you've chosen the version, specify it using the--versionparameter in theaz aro createcommand:
--version
az aro create
az aro create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name $CLUSTER \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet \
  --version <x.y.z>
az aro create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name $CLUSTER \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet \
  --version <x.y.z>
