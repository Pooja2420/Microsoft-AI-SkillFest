Virtual WAN network design considerations
Azure Virtual WANis a Microsoft-managed solution that provides end-to-end, global, and dynamic transit connectivity by default. Virtual WAN hubs eliminate the need to manually configure network connectivity. For example, you don't need to manage user-defined routes (UDR) or network virtual appliances (NVAs) to enable global transit connectivity.
Azure Virtual WAN simplifies end-to-end network connectivity in Azure, and to Azure from on-premises, by creating ahub-and-spoke network architecture. The architecture easily scales to support multiple Azure regions and on-premises locations (any-to-any connectivity) as shown in the following figure:

The Microsoft-managed routing function that's a part of every virtual hub enables the transit connectivity between virtual networks in Standard Virtual WAN. Each hub supports an aggregate throughput of up to 50 Gbps for VNet-to-VNet traffic.

ExpressRoute Standard or Premium circuits, in locations supported by Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach, can connect to a Virtual WAN ExpressRoute gateway. And they have all the Virtual WAN transit capabilities (VPN-to-VPN, VPN, and ExpressRoute transit). ExpressRoute Standard or Premium circuits that are in locations not supported by Global Reach can connect to Azure resources, but can't use Virtual WAN transit capabilities.

Virtual WAN network design recommendations
We recommend Virtual WAN for new large or global network deployments in Azure where you need global transit connectivity across Azure regions and on-premises locations. That way, you don't have to manually set up transitive routing for Azure networking.
The following figure shows a sample global enterprise deployment with datacenters spread across Europe and the United States. The deployment contains many branch offices within both regions. The environment is globally connected via Azure Virtual WAN andExpressRoute Global Reach.

Customers can connect on-premises devices to the NVA in the hub and also use the same appliance to inspect all North-South, East-West, and Internet-bound traffic.
