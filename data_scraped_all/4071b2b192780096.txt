Inputs
PathtoPublish-Path to publishstring. Required. Default value:$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory).
PathtoPublish
string
$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
Specifies the folder or file path to publish. This can be a fully qualified path or a path relative to the root of the repository. Wildcards are not supported.Variablesare supported. Example:$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory). For more information, seeArtifacts in pipelines - overview.
$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
ArtifactName-Artifact namestring. Required. Default value:drop.
ArtifactName
string
drop
Specifies the name of the artifact to create in the publish location. The following special characters are not allowed:+,%,{,}
+
%
{
}
publishLocation-Artifact publish locationInput alias:ArtifactType.string. Required. Allowed values:Container(Azure Pipelines),FilePath(A file share). Default value:Container.
publishLocation
ArtifactType
string
Container
FilePath
Container
Specifies whether to store the artifact in Azure Pipelines (Container), or to copy it to a file share (FilePath) that must be accessible from the build agent. The input alias:ArtifactTypeis an alternative name forpublishLocationand can be used interchangeably. For more information, seeArtifacts in Azure Pipelines.
ArtifactType
publishLocation
MaxArtifactSize-Max Artifact Sizestring. Default value:0.
MaxArtifactSize
string
0
Maximum limit on the size of artifacts to be published in bytes. Put 0 if you don't want to set any limit.
TargetPath-File share pathstring. Required whenArtifactType = FilePath.
TargetPath
string
ArtifactType = FilePath
Specifies the path to the file share where you want to copy the files. The path must be a fully qualified path or a valid path relative to the root directory of your repository. Publishing artifacts from a Linux or macOS agent to a file share is not supported. Example:\\my\share\$(Build.DefinitionName)\$(Build.BuildNumber).
\\my\share\$(Build.DefinitionName)\$(Build.BuildNumber)
Parallel-Parallel copyboolean. Optional. Use whenArtifactType = FilePath. Default value:false.
Parallel
boolean
ArtifactType = FilePath
false
Specifies whether to copy files in parallel using multiple threads for greater potential throughput. If this setting is not enabled, a single thread will be used.
ParallelCount-Parallel countstring. Optional. Use whenArtifactType = FilePath && Parallel = true. Default value:8.
ParallelCount
string
ArtifactType = FilePath && Parallel = true
8
Specifies the degree of parallelism (the number of threads) used to perform the copy. The value must be at least 1 and not greater than 128. Choose a value based on CPU capabilities of the build agent.
StoreAsTar-Tar the artifact before uploadingboolean. Default value:false.
StoreAsTar
boolean
false
Adds all files from the publish path to a tar archive before uploading. This allows you to preserve the UNIX file permissions. UseextractTarsoption of theDownloadBuildArtifactstask to extract the downloaded items automatically. This setting is ignored on Windows agents.
extractTars
FileCopyOptions-File copy optionsstring. Optional. Use whenArtifactType = FilePath.
FileCopyOptions
string
ArtifactType = FilePath
Passes additional options to the Robocopy command. For example, the recursive minimatch pattern**/*.
**/*
Task control options
All tasks have control options in addition to their task inputs. For more information, seeControl options and common task properties.
Output variables
None.
Remarks
Note
You cannot useBin,App_Dataand other folder names reserved by IIS as an Artifact name because this content is not served in response to Web requests. Please seeASP.NET Web Project Folder Structurefor more details.
