In this article
This article uses the Azure Blob Storage inventory feature and Azure Synapse to calculate the blob count and total size of blobs per container. These values are useful when optimizing blob usage per container.
Prerequisites
Enable inventory reports
The first step in this method is toenable inventory reportson your storage account. You may have to wait up to 24 hours after enabling inventory reports for your first report to be generated.
When you have an inventory report to analyze, grant yourself read access to the container where the report CSV file resides by assigning yourself theStorage Blob Data Readerrole. Be sure to use the email address of the account you're using to run the report. To learn how to assign an Azure role to a user with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), follow the instructions provided inAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
Note
To calculate the blob size from the inventory report, make sure to include theContent-Lengthschema field in your rule definition.
Create an Azure Synapse workspace
Next,create an Azure Synapse workspacewhere you will execute a SQL query to report the inventory results.
Create the SQL query
After you create your Azure Synapse workspace, do the following steps.
Navigate tohttps://web.azuresynapse.net.

Run the SQL query
Follow the below steps:
Add the following SQL query in your Azure Synapse workspace toread the inventory CSV file.For thebulkparameter, use the URL of the inventory report CSV file that you want to analyze.SELECT LEFT([Name], CHARINDEX('/', [Name]) - 1) AS Container,
        COUNT(*) As TotalBlobCount,
        SUM([Content-Length]) As TotalBlobSize
FROM OPENROWSET(
    bulk '<URL to your inventory CSV file>',
    format='csv', parser_version='2.0', header_row=true
) AS Source
GROUP BY LEFT([Name], CHARINDEX('/', [Name]) - 1)
