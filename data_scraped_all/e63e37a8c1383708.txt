You can view all routes of your Virtual WAN hub in the Azure portal. This article walks you through the steps to view effective routes. For more information about virtual hub routing, seeAbout virtual hub routing.
Select connections or route tables
Navigate to your virtual hub. In the left pane, selectEffective Routes.
From the dropdown, you can selectRoute Table. If you don't see a Route Table option, this means that you don't have a custom or default route table set up in this virtual hub.
View output
The page output shows the following fields:
Prefix: Address prefix known to the current entity (learned from the virtual hub router)
Next hop type: Can be Virtual Network Connection, VPN_S2S_Gateway, ExpressRouteGateway, Remote Hub, or Azure Firewall.
Next hop: This is the link to the resource ID of the next hop, or simply shows On-link to imply the current hub.
Origin: Resource ID of the routing source.
AS Path: BGP Attribute AS (autonomous system) path lists all the AS numbers that need to be traversed to reach the location where the prefix that the path is attached to, is advertised from.
Example
The values in the following example table imply that the virtual hub connection or route table has learned the route of 10.2.0.0/24 (a branch prefix). It has learned the route due to theVPN Next hop typeVPN_S2S_Gateway withNext hopVPN Gateway resource ID.Route Originpoints to the resource ID of the originating VPN gateway/Route table/Connection.AS Pathindicates the AS Path for the branch.
Use the scroll bar at the bottom of the table to view the 'AS Path'.

Considerations:
If you see 0.0.0.0/0 in theGet Effective Routesoutput, it implies the route exists in one of the route tables. However, if this route was set up for internet, an additional flag"enableInternetSecurity": trueis required on the connection. The effective route on the VM NIC won't show the route if the "enableInternetSecurity" flag on the connection is "false".

ThePropagate Default Routefield is seen in Azure Virtual WAN portal when you edit a virtual network connection, a VPN connection, or an ExpressRoute connection. This field indicates theenableInternetSecurityflag, which is always by default "false" for ExpressRoute and VPN connections, but "true" for virtual network connections.

When you view effective routes on a VM NIC, if you see the next hop as 'Virtual Network Gateway', that implies the Virtual hub router when the VM is in a spoke connected to a Virtual WAN hub.
