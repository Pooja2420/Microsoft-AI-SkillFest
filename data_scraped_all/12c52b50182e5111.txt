As a user who is assigned any of the limited administrator directory roles, you can use the Microsoft Entra admin center to invite B2B collaboration users. You can invite guest users to the directory, to a group, or to an application. After you invite a user through any of these methods, the invited user's account is added to Microsoft Entra ID, with a user type ofGuest. The guest user must then redeem their invitation to access resources. An invitation of a user doesn't expire.
After you add a guest user to the directory, you can either send the guest user a direct link to a shared app, or the guest user can select the redemption URL in the invitation email. For more information about the redemption process, seeB2B collaboration invitation redemption.
Important
You should follow the steps inHow-to: Add your organization's privacy info in Microsoft Entra IDto add the URL of your organization's privacy statement. As part of the first time invitation redemption process, an invited user must consent to your privacy terms to continue.
Instructions in this topic provide the basic steps to invite an external user. To learn about all of the properties and settings that you can include when you invite an external user, seeHow to create and delete a user.
Prerequisites
Make sure your organization's external collaboration settings are configured such that you're allowed to invite guests. By default, all users and admins can invite guests. But your organization's external collaboration policies might be configured to prevent certain types of users or admins from inviting guests. To find out how to view and set these policies, seeEnable B2B external collaboration and manage who can invite guests.
