This quickstart shows you how to create a Service Bus namespace and a queue using theAzure portal. It also shows you how to get authorization credentials that a client application can use to send/receive messages to/from the queue.
What are Service Bus queues?
Service Bus queues support abrokered messagingcommunication model. When you use queues, components of a distributed application don't communicate directly with each other; instead they exchange messages via a queue, which acts as an intermediary (broker). A message producer (sender) hands off a message to the queue and then continues its processing. Asynchronously, a message consumer (receiver) pulls the message from the queue and processes it. The producer doesn't have to wait for a reply from the consumer in order to continue to process and send further messages. Queues offerFirst In, First Out (FIFO)message delivery to one or more competing consumers. That is, messages are typically received and processed by the receivers in the order in which they were added to the queue, and each message is received and processed by only one message consumer.

Service Bus queues are a general-purpose technology that can be used for a wide variety of scenarios:
Communication between web and worker roles in a multi-tier Azure application.
Communication between on-premises apps and Azure-hosted apps in a hybrid solution.
Communication between components of a distributed application running on-premises in different organizations or departments of an organization.
Using queues enables you to scale your applications more easily, and enable more resiliency to your architecture.
Prerequisites
To complete this quickstart, make sure you have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create a namespace in the Azure portal
To begin using Service Bus messaging entities in Azure, you must first create a namespace with a name that is unique across Azure. A namespace provides a scoping container for Service Bus resources (queues, topics, etc.) within your application.
To create a namespace:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate to theAll servicespage.
Navigate to theAll servicespage.
On the left navigation bar, selectIntegrationfrom the list of categories, hover the mouse overService Bus, and then select+button on the Service Bus tile.

In theBasicstag of theCreate namespacepage, follow these steps:ForSubscription, choose an Azure subscription in which to create the namespace.ForResource group, choose an existing resource group, or create a new one.Enter aname for the namespace. The namespace name should adhere to the following naming conventions:The name must be unique across Azure. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available.The name length is at least 6 and at most 50 characters.The name can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens-.The name must start with a letter and end with a letter or number.The name doesn't end with-sbor-mgmt.ForLocation, choose the region in which your namespace should be hosted.ForPricing tier, select the pricing tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium) for the namespace. For this quickstart, selectStandard.If you selectPremiumtier, select whether you can enablegeo-replicationfor the namespace. The Geo-Replication feature ensures that the metadata and data of a namespace are continuously replicated from a primary region to one or more secondary regions.ImportantIf you want to usetopics and subscriptions, choose either Standard or Premium. Topics/subscriptions aren't supported in the Basic pricing tier.If you selected thePremiumpricing tier, specify the number ofmessaging units. The premium tier provides resource isolation at the CPU and memory level so that each workload runs in isolation. This resource container is called a messaging unit. A premium namespace has at least one messaging unit. You can select 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 messaging units for each Service Bus Premium namespace. For more information, seeService Bus Premium Messaging.SelectReview + createat the bottom of the page.On theReview + createpage, review settings, and selectCreate.
