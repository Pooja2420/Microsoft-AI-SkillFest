In this tutorial, you create a hub and spoke network topology using Azure Virtual Network Manager. You then deploy a virtual network gateway in the hub virtual network to allow resources in the spoke virtual networks to communicate with remote networks using VPN. Also, you configure a security configuration to block outbound network traffic to the internet on ports 80 and 443. Last, you verify that configurations were applied correctly by looking at the virtual network and virtual machine settings.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create multiple virtual networks.
Deploy a virtual network gateway.
Create a hub and spoke network topology.
Create a security configuration blocking traffic on port 80 and 443.
Verify configurations were applied.

Prerequisite
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Before you can complete steps in this tutorial, you must firstcreate an Azure Virtual Network Managerinstance. The instance needs to included theConnectivityandSecurity adminfeatures. This tutorial used a Virtual Network Manager instance namedvnm-learn-eastus-001.
Create virtual networks
This procedure walks you through creating three virtual networks that will be connected using the hub and spoke network topology.

Clean up resources
If you no longer need the Azure Virtual Network Manager, you need to make sure all of following is true before you can delete the resource:
There are no deployments of configurations to any region.
All configurations have been deleted.
All network groups have been deleted.
Use theremove components checklistto make sure no child resources are still available before deleting the resource group.
