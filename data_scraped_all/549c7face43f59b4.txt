Managing access to specific features in Azure DevOps can be crucial for maintaining the right balance of openness and security. Whether you're looking to grant or restrict access to certain functionalities for a group of users, understanding the flexibility beyond the standard permissions provided by built-in security groups is key.
If you're new to the permissions and groups landscape, seeGet started with permissions, access, and security groups. This article covers the essentials of permission states and how they inherit.
Tip
The structure of your project in Azure DevOps plays a pivotal role in determining the granularity of permissions at an object level, such as repositories and area paths. This structure is the foundation that allows you to fine-tune access controls, enabling you to specifically delineate which areas are accessible or restricted. For more information, seeAbout projects and scaling your organization.
Prerequisites
Use security groups
For optimal maintenance, we recommend using the default security groups or establishingcustom security groups to manage permissions. The permission settings for theProject AdministratorsandProject Collection Administratorsgroups are fixed by design and can't be altered. However, you have the flexibility to modify permissions for all other groups.
Managing permissions for a few users individually might seem feasible, but custom security groups provide a more organized approach. They streamline the oversight of roles and their associated permissions, ensuring clarity and ease of management design and can't be altered. But, you have the flexibility to modify permissions for all other groups.
Delegate tasks to specific roles
As an administrator or organization owner, delegating administrative tasks to team members who oversee specific areas is a strategic approach. The primary built-in roles equipped with predefined permissions and role assignments include:
Readers:Have read-only access to the project.
Contributors:Can contribute to the project by adding or modifying content.
Team Administrator:Manage team-related settings and permissions.
Project Administrators:Have administrative rights over the project.
Project Collection Administrators:Oversee the entire project collection and have the highest level of permissions.
These roles facilitate the distribution of responsibilities and streamline the management of project areas.
For for more information, seeDefault permissions and accessandChange project collection-level permissions.
To delegate tasks to other members within your organization, consider creating a custom security group and then granting permissions as indicated in the following table.

In addition to assigning permissions to individuals, you can manage permissions for various objects within Azure DevOps. These objects include:
Git repositories
Git branches
TFVC repositories
Build and release pipelines
Wikis.
These links provide detailed steps and guidelines for setting up and managing permissions effectively for the respective areas in Azure DevOps.

Limit user visibility
Warning
Consider the following limitations when using this preview feature:
The limited visibility features described in this section apply only to interactions through the web portal. With the REST APIs orazure devopsCLI commands, project members can access the restricted data.
azure devops
Users in the limited group can only select users who are explicitly added to Azure DevOps and not users who have access through Microsoft Entra group membership.
Guest users who are members in the limited group with default access in Microsoft Entra ID, can't search for users with the people picker.
Organizations and projects
By default, users added to an organization can view all organization and project information and settings. You can restrict specific users, such as Stakeholders, Microsoft Entra users, or members of a particular security group, with theLimit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectspreview feature for the organization. Once the featuregets turned on, any user or group thatgets added to theProject-Scoped Usersgroupis restricted in the following ways:
Access is confined to only the projects to which they're explicitly added.
Views displaying lists of users, projects, billing details, usage data, and more accessed throughOrganization settingsare restricted.
The set of people or groups that appear in people-picker search selections and the ability to@mentionpeople is limited.
Identity search and selection
With Microsoft Entra ID, you can use people pickers to search for any user or group in your organization, not just the ones in your current project. People pickers support the following Azure DevOps functions:
Selection of a user identity from a work tracking identity field such asAssigned To
Selection of a user or group using@mentionin a work item discussion or rich-text field, a pull request discussion, commit comments, or changeset or shelveset comments
Selection of a user or group using@mentionfrom a wiki page
As shown in the following image, start entering a user or security group name into a people picker box until you find a match.

Users and groups who are added to theProject-Scoped Usersgroup can only see and select users and groups in the project they're connected to from a people picker.
Turn on the preview feature and add users to the security group
Do the following steps to turn on the preview feature and add users and group to the Project-Scoped Users group:

All security groups in Azure DevOps are considered organization-level entities, even if they only have permissions for a specific project. This means that security groups get managed at the organization level.
From the web portal, the visibility of some security groups might be restricted based on the user's permissions. However, you can still discover the names of all security groups within an organization by using theazure devopsCLI tool or the REST APIs. For more information, seeAdd and manage security groups.
Restrict access to view or modify objects
Azure DevOps is designed to allow all authorized users to view all defined objects within the system. However, you can tailor access to resources by setting the permission state toDeny.
You can set permissions for members who belong to a custom security group or for individual users. For more information, seeRequest an increase in permission levels.
