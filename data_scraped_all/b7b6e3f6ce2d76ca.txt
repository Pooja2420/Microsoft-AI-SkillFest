This article describes how to manage capacity by adding a node (often called scale-out) to your Azure Local instance. In this article, each server is referred to as a node.
About add nodes
You can easily scale the compute and storage at the same time on Azure Local by adding nodes to an existing system. Your Azure Local instance supports a maximum of 16 nodes.
Each new physical node that you add to your system must closely match the rest of the nodes in terms of CPU type, memory, number of drives, and the type and size of the drives.
You can dynamically scale your Azure Local instance from 1 to 16 nodes. In response to the scaling, the orchestrator (also known as Lifecycle Manager) adjusts the drive resiliency, network configuration including the on-premises agents such as orchestrator agents, and Arc registration. The dynamic scaling may require the network architecture change from connected without a switch to connected via a network switch.
Important
In this release, you can only add one node at any given time. You can however add multiple nodes sequentially so that the storage pool is rebalanced only once.
It is not possible to permanently remove a node from a system.
Add node workflow
The following flow diagram shows the overall process to add a node:

To add a node, follow these high-level steps:
Install the operating system, drivers, and firmware on the new node that you plan to add. For more information, seeInstall OS.
Add the prepared node via theAdd-serverPowerShell cmdlet.
Add-server
When adding a node to the system, the system validates that the new incoming node meets the CPU, memory, and storage (drives) requirements before it actually adds the node.
Once the node is added, the system is also validated to ensure that it's functioning normally. Next, the storage pool is automatically rebalanced. Storage rebalance is a low priority task that doesn't impact actual workloads. The rebalance can run for multiple days depending on number of the nodes and the storage used.
Note
If you deployed your Azure Local instance using custom storage IPs, you must manually assign IPs to the storage network adapters after the node is added.
Supported scenarios
For adding a node, the following scale-out scenarios are supported:
When upgrading a system from two to three nodes, the storage resiliency level is changed from a two-way mirror to a three-way mirror.
Resiliency settings
In this release, for add node operation, specific tasks aren't performed on the workload volumes created after the deployment.
For add node operation, the resiliency settings are updated for the required infrastructure volumes and the workload volumes created during the deployment. The settings remain unchanged for other workload volumes that you created after the deployment (since the intentional resiliency settings of these volumes aren't known and you may just want a 2-way mirror volume regardless of the system scale).
However, the default resiliency settings are updated at the storage pool level and so any new workload volumes that you created after the deployment will inherit the resiliency settings.
Hardware requirements
When adding a node, the system validates the hardware of the new, incoming node and ensures that the node meets the hardware requirements before it's added to the system.
Prerequisites
Before you add a node, you would need to complete the hardware and software prerequisites.
Make sure to complete the following prerequisites:
The first step is to acquire new Azure Local hardware from your original OEM. Always refer to your OEM-provided documentation when adding new node hardware for use in your system.
Place the new physical node in the predetermined location, for example, a rack, and cable it appropriately.
Enable and adjust physical switch ports as applicable in your network environment.
Make sure to complete the following prerequisites:

Add a node
This section describes how to add a node using PowerShell, monitor the status of theAdd-Serveroperation and troubleshoot, if there are any issues.

Make sure that you have reviewed and completed theprerequisites.
On the new node that you plan to add, follow these steps.
Install the operating system and required drivers on the new node that you plan to add. Follow the steps inInstall the Azure Stack HCI Operating System, version 23H2.NoteFor versions 2503 and later, you'll need to use the OS image of the same solution as that running on the existing cluster. To get the OS image, contact Microsoft Support or OEM Support.

Register the node with Arc. Follow the steps inRegister with Arc and set up permissions.NoteYou must use the same parameters as the existing node to register with Arc. For example: Resource Group name, Region, Subscription, and Tenant.

On a node that already exists on your system, follow these steps:
Sign in with the domain user credentials (AzureStaclLCMUser or another user with equivalent permissions) that you provided during the deployment of the system.

If you are running a version prior to 2405.3, you must run the following command on the new node to clean up conflicting files:Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:SystemDrive\NugetStore" -Exclude Microsoft.AzureStack.Solution.LCMControllerWinService*,Microsoft.AzureStack.Role.Deployment.Service* | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
If you are running a version prior to 2405.3, you must run the following command on the new node to clean up conflicting files:

Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:SystemDrive\NugetStore" -Exclude Microsoft.AzureStack.Solution.LCMControllerWinService*,Microsoft.AzureStack.Role.Deployment.Service* | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
Run the following command to add the new incoming node using a local adminsitrator credential for the new node:$HostIpv4 = "<IPv 4 for the new node>"
$Cred = Get-Credential 
Add-Server -Name "<Name of the new node>" -HostIpv4 $HostIpv4 -LocalAdminCredential $Cred

After the operation is complete, the background storage rebalancing job will continue to run. Wait for the storage rebalance job to complete. To verify the progress of this storage rebalancing job, use the following cmdlet:Get-VirtualDisk|Get-StorageJobIf the storage rebalance job is complete, the cmdlet won't return an output.

To rerun the failed operation, use the following cmdlet:Add-Server -Rerun
To rerun the failed operation, use the following cmdlet:
Add-Server -Rerun

If you encounter an issue during the add node operation and need help from Microsoft Support, you can follow the steps inCollect diagnostic logs for Azure Local (preview)to collect and send the diagnostic logs to Microsoft.
You might need to provide diagnostic logs from the new node that's to be added to the cluster. Make sure you run theSend-DiagnosticDatacmdlet from the new node.
