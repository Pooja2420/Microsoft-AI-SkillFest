Configuring Reliable Actors--KVSActorStateProvider

You can modify the default configuration of KVSActorStateProvider by changing the settings.xml file that is generated in the Microsoft Visual Studio package root under the Config folder for the specified actor.
The Azure Service Fabric runtime looks for predefined section names in the settings.xml file and consumes the configuration values while creating the underlying runtime components.
Note
Donotdelete or modify the section names of the following configurations in the settings.xml file that is generated in the Visual Studio solution.
Replicator security configuration
Replicator security configurations are used to secure the communication channel that is used during replication. This means that services cannot see each other's replication traffic, ensuring that the data that is made highly available is also secure.
By default, an empty security configuration section prevents replication security.
Important
On Linux nodes, certificates must be PEM-formatted. To learn more about locating and configuring certificates for Linux, seeConfigure certificates on Linux.

Replicator configuration
Replicator configurations configure the replicator that is responsible for making the Actor State Provider state highly reliable.
The default configuration is generated by the Visual Studio template and should suffice. This section talks about additional configurations that are available to tune the replicator.

Store configuration
Store configurations are used to configure the local store that is used to persist the state that is being replicated.
The default configuration is generated by the Visual Studio template and should suffice. This section talks about additional configurations that are available to tune the local store.

Remarks
The BatchAcknowledgementInterval parameter controls replication latency. A value of '0' results in the lowest possible latency, at the cost of throughput (as more acknowledgement messages must be sent and processed, each containing fewer acknowledgements).
The larger the value for BatchAcknowledgementInterval, the higher the overall replication throughput, at the cost of higher operation latency. This directly translates to the latency of transaction commits.
