Monitor and collect diagnostic data for workflows in Azure Logic Apps

Applies to:Azure Logic Apps (Consumption + Standard)
To get richer data for debugging and diagnosing your workflows in Azure Logic Apps, you can log workflow runtime data and events, such as trigger events, run events, and action events, that you can send to aLog Analytics workspace, Azurestorage account, Azureevent hub, another partner destination, or all these destinations when you set up and useAzure Monitor Logs.
Note
Azure Monitor Resource Logs aren't 100% lossless. Resource Logs are based on a store and forward architecture designed to affordably move
petabytes of data per day at scale. This capability includes built-in redundancy and retries across the platform, but doesn't provide
transactional guarantees. Transactional monitoring might reduce the reliability and performance of the monitored service.
Also, transient logging errors must halt the upstream service when unable to confirm log delivery.
Whenever the Azure Monitor team can confirm a persistent source of data loss, the team considers resolution and prevention its highest priority.
However, small data losses might still happen due to temporary, non-repeating service issues distributed across Azure, and not all can be caught.
This how-to guide shows how to complete the following tasks, based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard logic app resource.

Azure Logic Apps now sends telemetry about your workflow runs to your Log Analytics workspace.
Note
After you enable diagnostics settings, diagnostics data might not flow for up to 30 minutes to the logs
at the specified destination, such as Log Analytics, storage account, or event hub. This delay means that
diagnostics data from this time period might not exist for you to review. Completed events andtracked propertiesmight not appear in your Log Analytics workspace for 10-15 minutes.

Sample queries
In your Log Analytics workspace's query pane, you can enter your own queries to find specific data, for example:
Select all events for a specific workflow run ID:LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
| where RunId == "08585258189921908774209033046CU00"
Select all events for a specific workflow run ID:

List all exceptions:LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
| where Error != ""
| sort by StartTime desc
List all exceptions:
LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
| where Error != ""
| sort by StartTime desc

Identify actions that have experienced retries:LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
| where RetryHistory != ""
| sort by StartTime desc
Identify actions that have experienced retries:
LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
| where RetryHistory != ""

Send diagnostic data to Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs
Along with Azure Monitor Logs, you can send the collected data to other destinations, for example:
Archive Azure resource logs to storage account
Stream Azure platform logs to Azure Event Hubs
You can then get real-time monitoring by using telemetry and analytics from other services, such asAzure Stream AnalyticsandPower BI, for example:
Stream data from Event Hubs to Stream Analytics
Analyze streaming data with Stream Analytics and create a real-time analytics dashboard in Power BI
Note
Retention periods apply only when you use a storage account.


Include custom properties in telemetry
In your workflow, triggers and actions have the capability for you to add the following custom properties so that their values appear along with the emitted telemetry in your Log Analytics workspace.
Custom tracking ID
Most triggers have aCustom Tracking Idproperty where you can specify a tracking ID using an expression. You can use this expression to get data from the received message payload or to generate unique values, for example:
If you don't specify this custom tracking ID, Azure automatically generates this ID and correlates events across a workflow run, including any nested workflows that are called from the parent workflow. You can manually specify this ID in a trigger by passing ax-ms-client-tracking-idheader with your custom ID value in the trigger request. You can use a Request trigger, HTTP trigger, or webhook-based trigger.
x-ms-client-tracking-id
Consumption
Standard


Tracked properties
Actions have aTracked Propertiessection where you can specify a custom property name and value by entering an expression or hardcoded value to track specific inputs or outputs, for example:
Consumption
Standard


Tracked properties can track only a single action's inputs and outputs, but you can use thecorrelationproperties of events to correlate across actions in a workflow run.
correlation
Tracked properties can only reference the parameters, inputs, and outputs for its own trigger or action.
Tracked properties aren't allowed on a trigger or action that has secure inputs, secure outputs, or both. They're also not allowed to reference another trigger or action that has secure inputs, secure outputs, or both.
The following examples show where custom properties appear in your Log Analytics workspace:
