Azure NetApp Files provides metrics on allocated storage, actual storage usage, volume I/OPS, and latency. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain a better understanding on the usage pattern and volume performance of your NetApp accounts.
Definitions
Understanding the terminology related to performance and capacity in Azure NetApp Files is essential to understanding the metrics available:
Capacity pool: A capacity pool is how capacity is billed in Azure NetApp Files. Capacity pools contain volume.
Volume quota: The amount of capacity provisioned to an Azure NetApp Files volume. Volume quota is directly tied to automatic Quality of Service (QoS), which impacts the volume performance. For more information, seeQoS types for capacity pools.
Throughput: The amount of data transmitted across the wire (read/write/other) between Azure NetApp Files and the client. Throughput in Azure NetApp Files is measured in bytes per second.
Latency: Latency is the amount of time for a storage operation to complete within storage from the time it arrives to the time it's processed and is ready to be sent back to the client. Latency in Azure NetApp Files is measured in milliseconds (ms).
About storage performance operation metrics
An operation in Azure NetApp Files is defined assomethingthat happens during a client/server conversation. For instance, when a client requests a file to be read from Azure NetApp Files, read and other operations are sent and received between the client and server.
When monitoring the Azure NetApp Files volume, read and write operations are self-explanatory. Also included in the metrics is a metric calledOther IOPS, meaning any operation that isn't a read or write.Other IOPSencompasses operations such as metadata, which is present alongside most read and write operations.
The following types of metadata operations are included in theOther IOPSmetric:

Throughput limit reachedThroughput limit reached is a boolean metric that denotes the volume is hitting its QoS limits. If the metric displays 1, the volume has reached its throughput, and throughput for this volume will be throttled. The value 0 means this limit hasn't yet been reached.NoteThe Throughput limit reached metrics is collected every 5 minutes. If the limit has been reached in the five-minute window, it means the limit has been reached in that window.If the volume is hitting the throughput limit, it's not sized appropriately for the application's demands. To resolve throughput issues:Resize the volume:Increase the volume size to allocate more throughput to the volume so it's not throttled.Modify the service level:The Premium and Ultra service levels in Azure NetApp Files cater to workloads with higher throughput requirements.Moving the volume to a capacity pool in a higher service levelautomatically increases these limits for the volume.Change the workloads/application:Consider repurposing the volume and delegating a different volume with a larger size and/or in a higher service level to meet your application requirements. If it's an NFS volume, consider changing mount options to reduce data flow if your application supports those changes.

Volume replication metrics
Note
Network transfer size (for example, theVolume replication total transfermetrics) might differ from the source or destination volumes of a cross-region replication. This behavior is a result of efficient replication engine being used to minimize the network transfer cost.
Volume replication metrics are currently populated for replication destination volumes and not the source of the replication relationship.
Is volume replication status healthyThe condition of the replication relationship. A healthy state is denoted by1. An unhealthy state is denoted by0.

Volume replication lag timeLag time is the actual amount of time the replication lags behind the source. It indicates the age of the replicated data in the destination volume relative to the source volume.
Note
When assessing the health status of the volume replication, consider the volume replication lag time. If the lag time is greater than the replication schedule, the replication volume won't catch up to the source. To resolve this issue, adjust the replication speed or the replication schedule.
