In Azure SignalR Service, you can use a managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID to:
Obtain access tokens.
Access secrets in Azure Key Vault.
The service supports only one managed identity. You can create either a system-assigned or a user-assigned identity. A system-assigned identity is dedicated to your Azure SignalR Service instance and is deleted when you delete the instance. A user-assigned identity is managed independently of your Azure SignalR Service resource.
This article shows you how to create a managed identity for Azure SignalR Service and how to use it in serverless scenarios.
Prerequisites
To use a managed identity, you must have the following items:
An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
An Azure SignalR Service resource.
Upstream resources that you want to access, such as an Azure Key Vault resource.
An Azure Functions app (function app).
Add a managed identity to Azure SignalR Service
You can add a managed identity to Azure SignalR Service in the Azure portal or the Azure CLI. This article shows you how to add a managed identity to Azure SignalR Service in the Azure portal.
Add a system-assigned identity
To add a system-assigned managed identity to your Azure SignalR Service instance:
In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure SignalR Service instance.
In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure SignalR Service instance.
SelectIdentity.
SelectIdentity.
On theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOn.
On theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOn.

SelectSave.

SelectYesto confirm the change.
SelectYesto confirm the change.
Add a user-assigned identity
To add a user-assigned identity to your Azure SignalR Service instance, you need to create the identity and then add it to the service.
Create a user-assigned managed identity resource according tothese instructions.

In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure SignalR Service instance.

SelectIdentity.

On theUser assignedtab, selectAdd.
On theUser assignedtab, selectAdd.
On theUser assigned managed identitiesdropdown menu, select the identity.
On theUser assigned managed identitiesdropdown menu, select the identity.

SelectAdd.
SelectAdd.
Use a managed identity in serverless scenarios
Azure SignalR Service is a fully managed service. It uses a managed identity to obtain an access token. In serverless scenarios, the service adds the access token into theAuthorizationheader in an upstream request.

Enable managed identity authentication in upstream settings
After you add asystem-assigned identityoruser-assigned identityto your Azure SignalR Service instance, you can enable managed identity authentication in the upstream endpoint settings:
In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure SignalR Service instance.

In the managed identity authentication settings, forAudience in the issued token, you can specify the targetresource. Theresourcewill become anaudclaim in the obtained access token, which can be used as a part of validation in your upstream endpoints. The resource can be in one of the following formats:Application (client) ID of the service principal.When using Application (client) ID, the application has to be in the same tenant that the Azure SignalR resource is in. If your application is in a different tenant, please follow these steps:Convert single-tenant app to multitenant on Microsoft Entra IDto convert your application to a multitenant application.Create an enterprise application from a multitenant application in Microsoft Entra IDto provision your application in the current tenant.Then you'll be able to find the enterprise application by clicking the "Or select from existing applications".Application ID URI of the service principal.ImportantUsing empty resource actually acquire a token targets to Microsoft Graph. As today, Microsoft Graph enables token encryption so it's not available for application to authenticate the token other than Microsoft Graph. In common practice, you should always create a service principal to represent your upstream target. And set theApplication IDorApplication ID URIof the service principal you've created.

You can easily set access validation for a function app without code changes by using the Azure portal:
In the Azure portal, go to the function app.
In the Azure portal, go to the function app.
SelectAuthenticationfrom the menu.
SelectAuthenticationfrom the menu.
SelectAdd identity provider.
SelectAdd identity provider.
On theBasicstab, in theIdentity providerdropdown list, selectMicrosoft.
On theBasicstab, in theIdentity providerdropdown list, selectMicrosoft.
InAction to take when request is not authenticated, selectLog in with Microsoft Entra ID.
InAction to take when request is not authenticated, selectLog in with Microsoft Entra ID.
The option to create a new registration is selected by default. You can change the name of the registration. For more information on enabling a Microsoft Entra provider, seeConfigure your App Service or Azure Functions app to use a Microsoft Entra ID sign-in.

After you configure these settings, the function app will reject requests without an access token in the header.
Validate access tokens
If you're not using WebApp or Azure Function, you can also validate the token.
The token in theAuthorizationheader is aMicrosoft identity platform access token.
Authorization
To validate access tokens, your app should also validate the audience and the signing tokens. These tokens need to be validated against the values in the OpenID discovery document. For an example, see thetenant-independent version of the document.
The Microsoft Entra middleware has built-in capabilities for validating access tokens. You can browse through theMicrosoft identity platform code samplesto find one in the language of your choice.
Libraries and code samples that show how to handle token validation are available. Several open-source partner libraries are also available for JSON Web Token (JWT) validation. There's at least one option for almost every platform and language. For more information about Microsoft Entra authentication libraries and code samples, seeMicrosoft identity platform authentication libraries.
Use a managed identity for a Key Vault reference
Azure SignalR Service can access Key Vault to get secrets by using the managed identity.
Add asystem-assigned identityoruser-assigned identityto your Azure SignalR Service instance.
Grant secret read permission for the managed identity in the access policies in Key Vault. SeeAssign a Key Vault access policy by using the Azure portal.
Currently, you can use this feature toreference a secret in the upstream URL pattern.
