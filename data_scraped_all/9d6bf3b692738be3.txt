Azure DNS is a hosted DNS management and name resolution service. You can use it to create public DNS names for other applications and services that you deploy in Azure. Creating a name for an Azure service in your custom domain is simple. You just add a record of the correct type for your service.
For dynamically allocated IP addresses, you can create a DNS CNAME record that maps to the DNS name that Azure created for your service. DNS standards prevent you from using a CNAME record for the zone apex. You can use an alias record instead. For more information, seeTutorial: Configure an alias record to refer to an Azure Public IP address.
For statically allocated IP addresses, you can create a DNS A record by using any name, which includes anaked domainname at the zone apex.
The following table outlines the supported record types you can use for various Azure services. As the table shows, Azure DNS supports only DNS records for Internet-facing network resources. Azure DNS can't be used for name resolution of internal, private addresses.
