Code coverage helps you determine the proportion of your project's code that is
actually being tested by tests such as unit tests. To increase your confidence
of the code changes, and guard effectively against bugs, your tests should
exercise - or cover - a large proportion of your code.
Reviewing the code coverage result helps to identify code path(s) that are not
covered by the tests. This information is important to improve the test collateral
over time by reducing the test debt.
Example
To view an example of publishing code coverage results for your choice of language,
see theEcosystemssection of the Pipelines topics. For example, collect and publish
code coverage forJavaScriptusing Istanbul.
View results
The code coverage summary can be viewed on theSummarytab on the pipeline run summary.

The results can be viewed and downloaded on theCode coveragetab.

Note
In a multi-stage YAML pipeline, the code coverage results are only available after the completion of the entire pipeline.
This means that you may have to separate the build stage into a pipeline of its own if you want to review the
code coverage results prior to deploying to production.
Note
Merging code coverage results from multipletest runsis
limited to .NET and .NET Core at present. This will be supported for other formats in a future release.
Artifacts
The code coverage artifacts published during the build can be viewed under theSummarytab on the pipeline run summary.

If you use theVisual Studio Testtask to collect coverage for .NET and .NET Core apps, the artifact contains.coveragefiles that can be downloaded and used for further analysis in Visual Studio.

If you publish code coverage using Cobertura or JaCoCo coverage formats, the code coverage artifact contains
an HTML file that can be viewed offline for further analysis.

Note
For .NET and .NET Core, the link to download the artifact is available by choosing the code coverage milestone in the build summary.
Tasks
Publish Code Coverage Resultspublishes code coverage results to Azure Pipelines or TFS,
which were produced by a build inCoberturaorJaCoCoformat.
Built-in tasks such asVisual Studio Test,.NET Core,Ant,Maven,Gulp,Grunt, andGradleprovide the option to publish code coverage data to the pipeline.
