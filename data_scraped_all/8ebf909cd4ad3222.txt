This article describes how to back up SAP HANA databases that are running on Azure VMs to an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault.
SAP HANA databases are critical workloads that require a low recovery-point objective (RPO) and long-term retention. You can back up SAP HANA databases running on Azure virtual machines (VMs) by usingAzure Backup.
Note
See theSAP HANA backup support matrixto know more about the supported configurations and scenarios.
Prerequisites
Refer to theprerequisitesand theWhat the pre-registration script doessections to set up the database for backup.
Establish network connectivity
For all operations, an SAP HANA database running on an Azure VM requires connectivity to the Azure Backup service, Azure Storage, and Microsoft Entra ID. This can be achieved by using private endpoints or by allowing access to the required public IP addresses or FQDNs. Not allowing proper connectivity to the required Azure services might lead to failure in operations like database discovery, configuring backup, performing backups, and restoring data.
The following table lists the various alternatives you can use for establishing connectivity:
Azure Storage:*.blob.core.windows.net,*.queue.core.windows.net,*.blob.storage.azure.net
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.queue.core.windows.net
*.blob.storage.azure.net
Microsoft Entra ID: Allow access to FQDNs mentioned in sections 56 and 59 ofMicrosoft 365 Common and Office Online.
Azure Backup service:.backup.windowsazure.com
.backup.windowsazure.com
More details around using these options are shared below:
Private endpoints allow you to connect securely from servers inside a virtual network to your Recovery Services vault. The private endpoint uses an IP from the VNET address space for your vault. The network traffic between your resources inside the virtual network and the vault travels over your virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network. This eliminates exposure from the public internet. Read more on private endpoints for Azure Backuphere.
Note
Private endpoints are supported for Azure Backup and Azure storage. Microsoft Entra ID has support private end-points in private preview. Until they are generally available, Azure backup supports setting up proxy for Microsoft Entra ID so that no outbound connectivity is required for HANA VMs. For more information, see theproxy support section.
If you use Network Security Groups (NSG), use theAzureBackupservice tag to allow outbound access to Azure Backup. In addition to the Azure Backup tag, you also need to allow connectivity for authentication and data transfer by creating similarNSG rulesfor Microsoft Entra ID (AzureActiveDirectory) and Azure Storage(Storage).  The following steps describe the process to create a rule for the Azure Backup tag:
InAll Services, go toNetwork security groupsand select the network security group.

SelectAddto save the newly created outbound security rule.
SelectAddto save the newly created outbound security rule.
You can similarly create NSG outbound security rules for Azure Storage and Microsoft Entra ID. For more information on service tags, seethis article.
If you're using Azure Firewall, create an application rule by using theAzureBackupAzure Firewall FQDN tag. This allows all outbound access to Azure Backup.
Note
Azure Backup currently doesn't support theTLS inspection enabledApplication Ruleon Azure Firewall.
If you choose to allow access service IPs, refer to the IP ranges in the JSON file availablehere. You'll need to allow access to IPs corresponding to Azure Backup, Azure Storage, and Microsoft Entra ID.
You can also use the following FQDNs to allow access to the required services from your servers:
*.backup.windowsazure.com
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.queue.core.windows.net
*.blob.storage.azure.net
*.login.microsoft.com
Note
Currently, we only support HTTP Proxy for Microsoft Entra traffic for SAP HANA. If you need to remove outbound connectivity requirements (for Azure Backup and Azure Storage traffic) for database backups via Azure Backup in HANA VMs, use other options, such as private endpoints.

Go to the "opt/msawb/bin" folder
Go to the "opt/msawb/bin" folder
Create a new JSON file named "ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json"
Create a new JSON file named "ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json"
Add a key-value pair to the JSON file as follows:{
    "UseProxyForAAD":true,
    "UseProxyForAzureBackup":false,
    "UseProxyForAzureStorage":false,
    "ProxyServerAddress":"http://xx.yy.zz.mm:port"
}
Add a key-value pair to the JSON file as follows:

    "UseProxyForAAD":true,
    "UseProxyForAzureBackup":false,
    "UseProxyForAzureStorage":false,
    "ProxyServerAddress":"http://xx.yy.zz.mm:port"
}
Change the permissions and ownership of the file as follows:chmod 750 ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json
chown root:msawb ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json
Change the permissions and ownership of the file as follows:
chmod 750 ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json
chown root:msawb ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json
chmod 750 ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json

Create a backup policy
A backup policy defines when backups are taken, and how long they're retained.
A policy is created at the vault level.
Multiple vaults can use the same backup policy, but you must apply the backup policy to each vault.
Note
Azure Backup doesnât automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes when backing up an SAP HANA database running in an Azure VM.
Modify the policy manually as needed.
Specify the policy settings as follows:
InPolicy name, enter a name for the new policy.

Note
Each log backup is chained to the previous full backup to form a recovery chain. This full backup will be retained until the retention of the last log backup has expired. This might mean that the full backup is retained for an extra period to make sure all the logs can be recovered. Let's assume a user has a weekly full backup, daily differential and 2 hour logs. All of them are retained for 30 days. But, the weekly full can be really cleaned up/deleted only after the next full backup is available, that is, after 30 + 7 days. For example, a weekly full backup happens on Nov 16th. According to the retention policy, it should be retained until Dec 16th. The last log backup for this full happens before the next scheduled full, on Nov 22nd. Until this log is available until Dec 22nd, the Nov 16th full can't be deleted. So, the Nov 16th full is retained until Dec 22nd.

Review backup status
Azure Backup periodically synchronizes the datasource between the extension installed on the VM and Azure Backup service, and shows the backup status in the Azure portal. The following table lists the (four) backup status for a datasource:
Generally, synchronization occursevery hour. However, at the extension level, Azure Backup polls every5 minutesto check for any changes in the status of the latest backup compared to the previous one. For example, if the previous backup is successful but the latest backup has failed, Azure Backup syncs that information to the service to update the backup status in the Azure portal accordingly toHealthyorUnhealthy.
If no data sync occurs to the Azure Backup service for more than2 hours, Azure Backup shows the backup status asNotReachable. This scenario might occur if the VM is shut down for an extended period or there's a network connectivity issue on the VM, causing the synchronization to cease. Once the VM is operational again and the extension services restart, the data sync operation to the service resumes, and the backup status changes toHealthyorUnhealthybased on the status of the last backup.
