Azure Monitor offers the following solutions for monitoring your networks:
Network Performance Monitor to:Monitor the health of your network.
Monitor the health of your network.
Azure Application Gateway analytics to review:Application Gateway logs.Application Gateway metrics.

Network Performance Monitor
TheNetwork Performance Monitormanagement solution is a network monitoring solution that monitors the health, availability, and reachability of networks. It's used to monitor connectivity between:
Public cloud and on-premises.
Datacenters and user locations like branch offices.
Subnets that host various tiers of a multi-tiered application.
For more information, seeNetwork Performance Monitor.
Application Gateway analytics
Enable diagnostics to direct the diagnostics to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor.
Consume the detailed summary for your resource by using the workbook template for Application Gateway.
If diagnostic logs aren't enabled for Application Gateway, only the default metric data would be populated within the workbook.
Review Azure networking data collection details
The Application Gateway analytics and the network security group analytics management solutions collect diagnostics logs directly from Application Gateway and network security groups. It isn't necessary to write the logs to Azure Blob Storage, and no agent is required for data collection.
The following table shows data collection methods and other details about how data is collected for Application Gateway analytics and the network security group analytics.
Enable Application Gateway diagnostics in the portal
In the Azure portal, go to the Application Gateway resource to monitor.

The following PowerShell script provides an example of how to enable resource logging for application gateways:
$workspaceId = "/subscriptions/d2e37fee-1234-40b2-5678-0b2199de3b50/resourcegroups/oi-default-east-us/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/rollingbaskets"

$gateway = Get-AzApplicationGateway -Name 'ContosoGateway'

Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId $gateway.ResourceId  -WorkspaceId $workspaceId -Enabled $true
$workspaceId = "/subscriptions/d2e37fee-1234-40b2-5678-0b2199de3b50/resourcegroups/oi-default-east-us/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/rollingbaskets"

$gateway = Get-AzApplicationGateway -Name 'ContosoGateway'

Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId $gateway.ResourceId  -WorkspaceId $workspaceId -Enabled $true
Application insights can be accessed via theInsightstab in your Application Gateway resource.

TheView detailed metricstab opens the pre-populated workbook that summarizes the data from your Application Gateway resource.

New capabilities with an Azure Monitor Network Insights workbook
Note
No other costs are associated with an Azure Monitor Network Insights workbook. The Log Analytics workspace will continue to be billed per usage.
The Network Insights workbook allows you to take advantage of the latest capabilities of Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, including:
Centralized console for monitoring and troubleshooting with bothmetricand log data.
Flexible canvas to support creation of custom-richvisualizations.
Ability to consume andshare workbook templateswith a wider community.
For more information about the capabilities of the new workbook solution, seeWorkbooks overview.
Migrate from the Azure Gateway analytics solution to Azure Monitor workbooks
Note
We recommend the Azure Monitor Network Insights workbook solution for accessing metric and log analytics for your Application Gateway resources.
Ensure thatdiagnostics settings are enabledto store logs in a Log Analytics workspace. If it's already configured, the Azure Monitor Network Insights workbook will be able to consume data from the same location. No more changes are required.NoteAll past data is already available within the workbook from the point when diagnostic settings were originally enabled. No data transfer is required.

Access thedefault insights workbookfor your Application Gateway resource. All existing insights supported by the Application Gateway analytics solution will be already present in the workbook. You can add customvisualizationsbased on metric and log data.

Troubleshooting
Follow the steps here to troubleshoot Azure Diagnostics.
Troubleshoot Azure Diagnostics
If you receive the following error message, the Microsoft.Insights resource provider isn't registered:
Failed to update diagnostics for 'resource'. {"code":"Forbidden","message":"Please register the subscription 'subscription id' with Microsoft.Insights."}
Failed to update diagnostics for 'resource'. {"code":"Forbidden","message":"Please register the subscription 'subscription id' with Microsoft.Insights."}
To register the resource provider, perform the following steps in the Azure portal:
In the navigation pane on the left, selectSubscriptions.
Select the subscription identified in the error message.
SelectResource providers.
Find themicrosoft.insightsprovider.
Select theRegisterlink.

After the Microsoft.Insights resource provider is registered, retry configuring the diagnostics.
In PowerShell, if you receive the following error message, you must update your version of PowerShell:
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'WorkspaceId'.
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'WorkspaceId'.
To update your version of Azure PowerShell, follow the instructions inInstall Azure PowerShell.
