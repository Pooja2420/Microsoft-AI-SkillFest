Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standardServer Message Block (SMB) protocolorNetwork File System (NFS) protocol. Both NFS and SMB protocols are supported on Azure virtual machines (VMs) running Linux. This tutorial shows you how to create an Azure file share using the NFS protocol and connect it to a Linux VM.
In this tutorial, you will:
Create a storage account
Deploy a Linux VM
Create an NFS file share
Connect to your VM
Mount the file share to your VM
Applies to
Getting started
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create a storage account
Before you can work with an NFS file share, you have to create a storage account for SSD file shares.
On the Azure portal menu, selectAll services. In the list of resources, typeStorage Accounts. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. SelectStorage Accounts.
On theStorage Accountswindow that appears, choose+ Create.
On theBasicstab, select the subscription in which to create the storage account.
Under theResource groupfield, selectCreate newto create a new resource group to use for this tutorial.
Enter a name for your storage account. The name you choose must be unique across Azure. The name also must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and may include only numbers and lowercase letters.
Select a region for your storage account, or use the default region. Azure supports NFS file shares in all the same regions that support SSD file shares.
Select thePremiumperformance tier to store your data on solid-state drives (SSD). UnderPremium account type, selectFile shares.
Leave replication set to its default value ofLocally redundant storage (LRS).
SelectReview + Createto review your storage account settings and create the account.
When you see theValidation passednotification appear, selectCreate. You should see a notification that deployment is in progress.
The following image shows the settings on theBasicstab for a new storage account:

Deploy an Azure VM running Linux
Next, create an Azure VM running Linux to represent the on-premises server. When you create the VM, a virtual network will be created for you. The NFS protocol can only be used from a machine inside of a virtual network.

In theBasicstab, underProject details, make sure the correct subscription and resource group are selected. UnderInstance details, typemyVMfor theVirtual machine name, and select the same region as your storage account. Choose your Linux distribution for yourImage. Leave the other defaults. The default size and pricing is only shown as an example. Size availability and pricing are dependent on your region and subscription.

Create an NFS Azure file share
Now you're ready to create an NFS file share and provide network-level security for your NFS traffic.

Set up a private endpoint or service endpoint
Next, set up a private endpoint for your storage account. This gives your storage account a private IP address from within the address space of your virtual network. Standarddata processing ratesfor private endpoints apply. If you don't require a static IP address, you can use a service endpoint instead. There's no extra charge for using service endpoints.
Select the file shareqsfileshare. You should see a dialog that saysConnect to this NFS share from Linux. UnderNetwork configuration, selectReview options

Disable secure transfer
Azure Files doesn't currently support encryption-in-transit with the NFS protocol and relies instead on network-level security. Therefore, you'll need to disable secure transfer.

You can use the SSH key you created the next time you create a VM in Azure. Just select theUse a key stored in AzureforSSH public key sourcethe next time you create a VM. You already have the private key on your computer, so you won't need to download anything.
Mount the NFS share
Now that you've created an NFS share, you have to mount it on your Linux client. Using Azure Storage Explorer isn't supported for NFS Azure file shares, either standalone or from within the Azure portal. To view the files in the share, you must mount the share.

Clean up resources
When you're done, delete the resource group. Deleting the resource group deletes the storage account, the Azure file share, and any other resources that you deployed inside the resource group.
SelectHomeand thenResource groups.
Select the resource group you created for this tutorial.
SelectDelete resource group. A window opens and displays a warning about the resources that will be deleted with the resource group.
Enter the name of the resource group, and then selectDelete.
