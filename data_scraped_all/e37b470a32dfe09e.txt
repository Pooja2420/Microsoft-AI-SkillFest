By default, IoT Hub's hostnames map to a public endpoint with a publicly routable IP address over the internet. Different customers share this IoT Hub public endpoint, and IoT devices in wide-area networks and on-premises networks can all access it.

Some IoT Hub features, includingmessage routing,file upload, andbulk device import/export, also require connectivity from IoT Hub to a customer-owned Azure resource over its public endpoint. These connectivity paths make up the egress traffic from IoT Hub to customer resources.
You might want to restrict connectivity to your Azure resources (including IoT Hub) through a VNet that you own and operate for several reasons, including:
Introducing network isolation for your IoT hub by preventing connectivity exposure to the public internet.

This article describes how to achieve these goals usingAzure Private Linkfor ingress connectivity to IoT Hub and using trusted Microsoft services exception for egress connectivity from IoT Hub to other Azure resources.
Ingress connectivity to IoT Hub using Azure Private Link
A private endpoint is a private IP address allocated inside a customer-owned VNet through which an Azure resource is reachable. With Azure Private Link, you can set up a private endpoint for your IoT hub to allow services inside your VNet to reach IoT Hub without requiring traffic to be sent to IoT Hub's public endpoint. Similarly, your on-premises devices can useVirtual Private Network (VPN)orExpressRoutepeering to gain connectivity to your VNet and your IoT hub (via its private endpoint). As a result, you can restrict or completely block off connectivity to your IoT hub's public endpoints by usingIoT Hub IP filterorthe public network access toggle. This approach keeps connectivity to your hub using the private endpoint for devices. The main focus of this setup is for devices inside an on-premises network. This setup isn't advised for devices deployed in a wide-area network.

Before proceeding ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
You'vecreated an Azure VNetwith a subnet in which the private endpoint will be created.

Set up a private endpoint for IoT Hub ingress
Private endpoint works for IoT Hub device APIs (like device-to-cloud messages) and service APIs (like creating and updating devices).

Built-in Event Hubs compatible endpoint
Thebuilt-in Event Hubs compatible endpointcan also be accessed over private endpoint. When private link is configured, you should see another private endpoint connection for the built-in endpoint. It's the one withservicebus.windows.netin the FQDN.
servicebus.windows.net

IoT Hub'sIP filtercan optionally control public access to the built-in endpoint.
To completely block public network access to your IoT hub,turn off public network accessor use IP filter to block all IP and select the option to apply rules to the built-in endpoint.
Pricing for Private Link

Egress connectivity from IoT Hub to other Azure resources
IoT Hub can connect to your Azure blob storage, event hub, service bus resources formessage routing,file upload, andbulk device import/exportover the resources' public endpoint. Binding your resource to a VNet blocks connectivity to the resource by default. As a result, this configuration prevents IoT hubs from sending data to your resources. To fix this issue, enable connectivity from your IoT Hub resource to your storage account, event hub, or service bus resources via thetrusted Microsoft serviceoption.
To allow other services to find your IoT hub as a trusted Microsoft service, your hub must use a managed identity. Once a managed identity is provisioned, grant permission to your hub's managed identity to access your custom endpoint. Follow the articleManaged identities support in IoT Hubto provision a managed identity with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permission, and add the custom endpoint to your IoT hub. Make sure you turn on the trusted Microsoft first party exception to allow your IoT hubs access to the custom endpoint if you have the firewall configurations in place.
Pricing for trusted Microsoft service option
Trusted Microsoft first party services exception feature is free of charge. Charges for the provisioned storage accounts, event hubs, or service bus resources apply separately.
