Back up SAP HANA database instance snapshots on Azure VMs

This article describes how to back up SAP HANA database instances that are running on Azure VMs to an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault.
Azure Backup now performs an SAP HANA storage snapshot-based backup of an entire database instance. Backup combines an Azure managed disk full or incremental snapshot with HANA snapshot commands to provide instant HANA backup and restore.
Note
Currently, the snapshots are stored on your storage account/operational tier, and isn't stored in Recovery Services vault. Thus, the vault features, such as Cross-region restore,Cross-subscription restore, and security capabilities, aren't supported.
Original Location Restore (OLR) isn't supported.
HANA System Replication (HSR)) isn't supported.
For pricing, as per SAP advisory, you must do a weekly full backup + logs streaming/Backint based backup so that the existing protected instance fee and storage cost are applied. For snapshot backup, the snapshot data created by Azure Backup is saved in your storage account and incurs snapshot storage charges. Thus, in addition to streaming/Backint backup charges, you're charged for per GB data stored in your snapshots, which is charged separately. Learn more aboutSnapshot pricingandStreaming/Backint based backup pricing.
For more information about the supported configurations and scenarios, seeSAP HANA backup support matrix.
Before you start
Policy
According to SAP, it's mandatory to run a weekly full backup of all databases within an instance. Currently, logs are also mandatory for a database when you're creating a policy. With snapshots happening daily, we donât see a need for incremental or differential backups in the database policy. Therefore, all databases in the database instance, which is required to be protected by a snapshot, should have a database policy of onlyweekly fulls + logs ONLY, along with daily snapshots at an instance level.
Important
As per SAP advisory, we recommend you to configureDatabase via Backintwithweekly fulls + log backup onlypolicy before configuringDB Instance via Snapshotbackup. Ifweekly fulls + logs backup only using Backint based backupisn't enabled, snapshot backup configuration will fail.
Because the policy doesnât call for differential or incremental backups, we donotrecommend that you trigger on-demand differential backups from any client.
To summarize the backup policy:
Always protect all databases within an instance with a database policy before you apply daily snapshots to the database instance.
Make sure that all database policies have onlyWeekly fulls + logsand no differential/incremental backups.
Donottrigger on-demand Backint-based streaming differential or incremental backups for these databases.
Permissions required for backup
You must assign the required permissions to the Azure Backup service, which resides on a HANA virtual machine (VM), to take snapshots of the managed disks and place them in a user-specified resource group that's mentioned in the policy. To do so, you can use the system-assigned managed identity of the source VM.
The following table lists the resource, permissions, and scope.
When you're assigning permissions, consider the following:
The credentials that are used should have permissions to grant roles to other resources and should be either Owner or User Access Administrator, as mentioned in thesteps for assigning user roles.
The credentials that are used should have permissions to grant roles to other resources and should be either Owner or User Access Administrator, as mentioned in thesteps for assigning user roles.
During backup configuration, you can use the Azure portal to assign the previously mentioned permissions, except Disk Snapshot Contributor to the Backup Management Service principal for the snapshot resource group. You need to manually assign this permission.

We recommend that younotchange the resource groups after they're given or assigned to Azure Backup, because it makes it easier to handle the permissions.

Create a Recovery Services vault
A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points that are created over time, and it provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies.
To create a Recovery Services vault:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forBusiness Continuity Center, and then go to theBusiness Continuity Centerdashboard.

On theRecovery Services vaultpane, enter the following values:Subscription: Select the subscription to use. If you're a member of only one subscription, you'll see that name. If you're not sure which subscription to use, use the default subscription. There are multiple choices only if your work or school account is associated with more than one Azure subscription.Resource group: Use an existing resource group or create a new one. To view a list of available resource groups in your subscription, selectUse existing, and then select a resource in the dropdown list. To create a new resource group, selectCreate new, and then enter the name. For more information about resource groups, seeAzure Resource Manager overview.Vault name: Enter a friendly name to identify the vault. The name must be unique to the Azure subscription. Specify a name that has at least 2 but not more than 50 characters. The name must start with a letter and consist only of letters, numbers, and hyphens.Region: Select the geographic region for the vault. For you to create a vault to help protect any data source, the vaultmustbe in the same region as the data source.ImportantIf you're not sure of the location of your data source, close the window. Go to the list of your resources in the portal. If you have data sources in multiple regions, create a Recovery Services vault for each region. Create the vault in the first location before you create a vault in another location. There's no need to specify storage accounts to store the backup data. The Recovery Services vault and Azure Backup handle that automatically.

Note
Azure Backup now supports immutable vaults that help you ensure that recovery points once created can't be deleted before their expiry as per the backup policy. You can make the immutability irreversible for maximum protection to your backup data from various threats, including ransomware attacks and malicious actors.Learn more.
