Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port.
Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. So if/imagesis in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. If/videois in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos.
/images
/video

This type of routing is known as application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing. Azure Application Gateway can do URL-based routing and more.
Note
Azure provides a suite of fully managed load-balancing solutions for your scenarios.
If you're looking to do DNS based global routing and donothave requirements for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol termination ("SSL offload"), per-HTTP/HTTPS request or application-layer processing, reviewTraffic Manager.
If you need to optimize global routing of your web traffic and optimize top-tier end-user performance and reliability through quick global failover, seeFront Door.
To do transport layer load balancing, reviewLoad Balancer.
Your end-to-end scenarios may benefit from combining these solutions as needed.
For an Azure load-balancing options comparison, seeOverview of load-balancing options in Azure.
