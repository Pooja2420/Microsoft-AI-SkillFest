Azure Monitor collects and aggregates metrics and logs from your system to monitor availability, performance, and resilience, and notify you of issues affecting your system. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, or client libraries to set up and view monitoring data.
Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. This article describes the types of monitoring data you can collect for this service and ways to analyze that data.
Collect data with Azure Monitor
This table describes how you can collect data to monitor your service, and what you can do with the data once collected:
For the list of all of the data supported by Azure Monitor, see:

Built in monitoring for Azure DDoS Protection
Azure DDoS Protection offers in-depth insights and visualizations of attack patterns through DDoS Attack Analytics. It provides customers with comprehensive visibility into attack traffic and mitigation actions via reports and flow logs. During a DDoS attack, detailed metrics are available through Azure Monitor, which also allows alert configurations based on these metrics.
You can view and configure Azure DDoS protection telemetry.
Telemetry for an attack is provided through Azure Monitor in real time. Whilemitigation triggersfor TCP SYN, TCP & UDP are available during peace-time, other telemetry is available only when a public IP address has been under mitigation.
You can view DDoS telemetry for a protected public IP address through three different resource types: DDoS protection plan, virtual network, and public IP address.
Logging can be further integrated withMicrosoft Sentinel, Splunk (Azure Event Hubs), OMS Log Analytics, and Azure Storage for advanced analysis via the Azure Monitor Diagnostics interface.
For more information on metrics, seeMonitoring Azure DDoS Protectionfor details on DDoS Protection monitoring logs.

Note
When you change DDoS IP protection fromenabledtodisabled, telemetry for the public IP resource isn't available.
View DDoS mitigation policies
Azure DDoS Protection uses three automatically adjusted mitigation policies (TCP SYN, TCP, and UDP) for each public IP address of the resource being protected. This approach applies to any virtual network with DDoS protection enabled.
You can see the policy limits within your public IP address metrics by choosing theInbound SYN packets to trigger DDoS mitigation,Inbound TCP packets to trigger DDoS mitigation, andInbound UDP packets to trigger DDoS mitigationmetrics. Make sure to set the aggregation type toMax.

View peace time traffic telemetry
It's important to keep an eye on the metrics for TCP SYN, UDP, and TCP detection triggers. These metrics help you know when DDoS protection starts. Make sure these triggers reflect the normal traffic levels when there's no attack.
You can make a chart for the public IP address resource. In this chart, include the Packet Count and SYN Count metrics. The Packet count includes both TCP and UDP Packets. This shows you the sum of traffic.

Note
To make a fair comparison, you need to convert the data to packets-per-second. You can do this conversion by dividing the number you see by 60, as the data represents the number of packets, bytes, or SYN packets collected over 60 seconds. For example, if you have 91,000 packets collected over 60 seconds, divide 91,000 by 60 to get approximately 1,500 packets-per-second (pps).
Validate and test
To simulate a DDoS attack to validate DDoS protection telemetry, seeValidate DDoS detection.
Use Azure Monitor tools to analyze the data
These Azure Monitor tools are available in the Azure portal to help you analyze monitoring data:
Some Azure services have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal. These dashboards are calledinsights, and you can find them in theInsightssection of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

Use Azure Monitor alerts to notify you of issues
Azure Monitor alertsallow you to identify and address issues in your system, and proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data before your customers notice them. You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There aredifferent types of Azure Monitor alertsdepending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. SeeChoosing the right type of alert rule.

For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, seeSample log alert queries.
Implementing alerts at scale
For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region.Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines at scale.
