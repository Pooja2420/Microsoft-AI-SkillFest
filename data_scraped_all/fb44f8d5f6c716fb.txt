Managed DevOps Pools agents can be configured to run in an isolated virtual network, or into an existing virtual network. This article describes how to configure your Managed DevOps Pool to run agents in your virtual network.
Adding agents to your own virtual network
You may want to add agents from Managed DevOps Pools to your own virtual network for scenarios such as:
Your CI/CD Agents need to access resources that are only available in your company network through a service like Express Route
Your CI/CD Agents need to access resources that are isolated to private endpoints
You want to network isolate your CI/CD infrastructure by bringing your own VNet with company specific firewall rules
Any other unique use cases that can't be achieved by out-of-box Managed DevOps Pools networking related features
You can add your pool's agents to your virtual network using the following steps.
Create or bring your virtual network and subnet
Delegate the subnet to Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools
Associate the subnet with your Managed DevOps Pool
The previous steps delegate the subnet for exclusive access by the pool and the subnet can't be used by other pools or resources.
In order to connect multiple pools to the same virtual network, multiple subnets can be used, each delegated and associated with their own pool.
Create or bring your virtual network and subnet
The subnet must have enough address space to accommodate the max pool size of the pool you want to associate (include the 5 IP address Azure reserves in the subnet).
If you're using Express Route, you need to temporary drop or change the management lock on the resource group to allow writes.
Important
The Managed DevOps Pool and virtual network must be in the same region, or you'll get an error similar to the following when you try to create the pool or update the network configuration.Virtual network MDPVN is in region eastus, but pool mdpnonprodsub is in region australiaeast. These must be in the same region.
Virtual network MDPVN is in region eastus, but pool mdpnonprodsub is in region australiaeast. These must be in the same region.
Grant Reader and Network Contributor access to DevOpsInfrastructure service principal
Ensure the DevOpsInfrastructure principal has the following access on the virtual network:
ReaderandNetwork Contributor
Reader
Network Contributor
Or add the following permission to a custom role:Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/*/readMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/actionMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/validate/actionMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/writeMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/delete

Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/write
Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/delete
Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/delete
Make a custom role for theService Association Linkaccess. An example role can be created at the resource group or subscription level in the Access Control tab, as shown in the following example.

To check the DevOpsInfrastructure principal access
ChooseAccess control (IAM)for the virtual network, and chooseCheck access.
ChooseAccess control (IAM)for the virtual network, and chooseCheck access.

Search forDevOpsInfrastructureand select it.
Search forDevOpsInfrastructureand select it.

VerifyReaderaccess. Verify thatMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action,Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/validate/actionandMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/writeaccess is assigned. Your custom role should appear here.

Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/validate/action
Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/serviceAssociationLinks/write

IfDevOpsInfrastructuredoesn't have those permissions, add them by choosingAccess control (IAM)for the virtual network, and chooseGrant access to this resourceand add them.

Delegate the subnet to Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools
The subnet needs to be delegated to theMicrosoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/poolsto be used.
Open the subnet properties in the Portal and selectMicrosoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/poolsunder the Subnet Delegation section and chooseSave.
Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools
Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools

This delegates the subnet for exclusive access for the pool and the subnet can't be used by other pools or resources. In order to connect multiple pools to the same virtual network, multiple subnets must be used, each delegated and associated with their own pool. More information on subnet delegation can be foundhere.
Once the subnet is delegated toMicrosoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools, the pool can be updated to use the subnet.
Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools
Associate the subnet with your Managed DevOps Pool
Azure portal
ARM template
Azure CLI
If you're creating a new pool, go to theNetworkingtab. To update an existing pool, go toSettings>Networking, and chooseAgents injected into existing virtual network,Configure.

Choose theSubscription,Virtual Network, andSubnetyou delegated toMicrosoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools, and chooseOk.
Choose theSubscription,Virtual Network, andSubnetyou delegated toMicrosoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools, and chooseOk.
Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools

Once the network update completes, newly created resource in the pool will use the delegated subnet.
If you are using ARM templates, add anetworkProfileproperty if it doesn't already exist, then add asubnetIdproperty undernetworkProfilewith the resource ID of your subnet.

        }
        ...
    }
}
Networking is configured using thenetworkProfileproperty in thefabricProfilesection whencreatingorupdatinga pool. For an isolated network, omit thenetworkProfileproperty when creating a pool.

Restricting outbound connectivity
If you have systems in place on your network (NSG, Firewall etc.) which restrict outbound connectivity, you need to ensure that the following domains can be accessed, otherwise your Managed DevOps Pool will not be functional.
All of them are HTTPS, unless otherwise stated.

Azure related endpoints:
Azure VMs may route traffic to certain Azure features through your subnet. For these requests, you have the option of routing requests through Azure directly, or enabling access through your network.Configuring Azure traffic to run through Service EndpointsRouting traffic through Azure directly avoids adding throughput to your NSGs or Firewalls, and does not require that you allowlist the domains listed in the following option.For example, using thedata diskfeature will involve network calls to Azure Storage. EnablingMicrosoft.Storageservice endpoint on your network will route traffic directly through Azure, avoiding your network rules and reducing load.If you want to avoid routing traffic through Service Endpoints, these are the domains to allowlist for specific features.md-*.blob.storage.azure.net- Required toconfigure a data disk

If you configure your Azure DevOps Pipeline to run inside of a container, you need to also allowlist the source of the container image (Docker or ACR).
Configure the Azure DevOps Agent to run behind a Proxy
If you configured a proxy service on your image and want your workloads running on your Managed DevOps pool to run behind this proxy, you must add the following environment variables on your image.
VSTS_AGENT_INPUT_PROXYURL- The URL of the configured proxy to run behind
VSTS_AGENT_INPUT_PROXYURL
VSTS_AGENT_INPUT_PROXYUSERNAME- The username needed to use the proxy
VSTS_AGENT_INPUT_PROXYUSERNAME
VSTS_AGENT_INPUT_PROXYPASSWORD- The password to use the proxy.
VSTS_AGENT_INPUT_PROXYPASSWORD
For Windows, these environment variables should be system environment variables, and for Linux these variables should be in the/etc/environmentfile. Setting these system variables incorrectly or without a configured proxy service on the image causes provisioning of new agents to fail with network connectivity issues.
If you are migrating from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents and are already using the proxy environment variables on your image, as described inAzure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents- Customizing Pipeline Agent Configuration, no changes should be required.
