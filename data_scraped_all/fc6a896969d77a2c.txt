Get started with Azure DDoS Network Protection by using the Azure portal.
A DDoS protection plan defines a set of virtual networks that have DDoS Network Protection enabled, across subscriptions. You can configure one DDoS protection plan for your organization and link virtual networks from multiple subscriptions under a single Microsoft Entra tenant to the same plan.
In this QuickStart, you create a DDoS protection plan and link it to a virtual network.

Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Sign in to theAzure portal. Ensure that your account is assigned to thenetwork contributorrole or to acustom rolethat is assigned the appropriate actions listed in the how-to guide onPermissions.

Note
Although DDoS Protection Plan resources needs to be associated with a region, users can enable DDoS protection on Virtual Networks in different regions and across multiple subscriptions under a single Microsoft Entra tenant.

Note
You cannot move a virtual network to another resource group or subscription when DDoS Protection is enabled for the virtual network. If you need to move a virtual network with DDoS Protection enabled, disable DDoS Protection first, move the virtual network, and then enable DDoS Protection. After the move, the auto-tuned policy thresholds for all the protected public IP addresses in the virtual network are reset.
Enable for an existing virtual network
Create a DDoS protection plan by completing the steps inCreate a DDoS protection plan, if you don't have an existing DDoS protection plan.
Enter the name of the virtual network in theSearch resources, services, and docsbox at the top of the Azure portal. When it appears in the search results, select it.
UnderSettings, selectDDoS protection.
SelectEnable. UnderDDoS protection plan, choose an existing plan or the one you created in step 1, then selectSave. The plan can be in the same or a different subscription than the virtual network, but both must be associated with the same Microsoft Entra tenant.
Add Virtual Networks to an existing DDoS protection plan
You can also enable the DDoS protection plan for an existing virtual network from the DDoS Protection plan itself. This is useful if you have multiple virtual networks to protect with the same plan.
Search forDDoS protection plansin theSearch resources, services, and docs boxat the top of the Azure portal. When it appears, select it.
Select the desired DDoS protection plan from the list.
UnderSettings, selectProtected resources.
SelectAdd, choose the subscription, resource group, and virtual network, then selectAddagain.
Configure an Azure DDoS Protection Plan using Azure Firewall Manager
Azure Firewall Manager is a platform to manage and protect your network resources at scale. You can associate your virtual networks with a DDoS protection plan within Azure Firewall Manager. SeeConfigure an Azure DDoS Protection Plan using Azure Firewall Manager.
Enable DDoS protection for all virtual networks
Thisbuilt-in policydetects virtual networks within a defined scope that don't have DDoS Network Protection enabled. It can then optionally create a remediation task to enable protection for the virtual network. SeeAzure Policy built-in definitions for Azure DDoS Network Protectionfor full list of built-in policies.
View protected resources
First, check the details of your DDoS protection plan:
Search forDDoS protection plansin theSearch resources, services, and docs boxat the top of the Azure portal. When it appears, select it.
Select your DDoS protection plan from the list.
UnderSettings, selectProtected resources.
In theProtected resourcespage, you can view the resources that are protected by this DDoS protection plan.
Disable for a virtual network:
You can disable DDoS protection for a virtual network while keeping it enabled on other virtual networks. To disable DDoS protection for a virtual network, follow these steps.
Search forVirtual Networkin theSearch resources, services, and docs boxat the top of the Azure portal. When it appears, select it.
UnderSettings, selectDDoS Protection.
SelectDisableforDDoS Network Protection.
Note
Disabling DDoS protection for a virtual network won't delete the protection plan. You'll still incur costs if you only disable DDoS protection without deleting the plan. To avoid unnecessary charges, you need to delete the DDoS protection plan resource. SeeClean up resources.
Clean up resources
You can keep your resources for the next tutorial. If no longer needed, delete theMyResourceGroupused in this example. When you delete the resource group, you also delete the DDoS protection plan and all its related resources. If you don't intend to use this DDoS protection plan, you should remove resources to avoid unnecessary charges.
Warning
This action is irreversible.
In the Azure portal, search for and selectResource groups, or selectResource groupsfrom the Azure portal menu.
In the Azure portal, search for and selectResource groups, or selectResource groupsfrom the Azure portal menu.

Select the resource group, then selectDelete resource group.
Type the resource group name to verify, and then selectDelete.
Type the resource group name to verify, and then selectDelete.
Note
To delete a DDoS protection plan, first dissociate all virtual networks from it.
