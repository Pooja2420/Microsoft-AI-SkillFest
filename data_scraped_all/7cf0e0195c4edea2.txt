Configure Connection Monitor for Azure ExpressRoute

This article guides you through configuring a Connection Monitor extension to monitor ExpressRoute. Connection Monitor is a cloud-based network monitoring solution that tracks connectivity between Azure cloud deployments and on-premises locations (such as branch offices). It's part of Azure Monitor logs and allows you to monitor network connectivity for both private and Microsoft peering connections. By configuring Connection Monitor for ExpressRoute, you can identify and resolve network issues.
Note
This article was recently updated to use the term Azure Monitor logs instead of Log Analytics. Log data is still stored in a Log Analytics workspace and is still collected and analyzed by the same Log Analytics service. We are updating the terminology to better reflect the role oflogs in Azure Monitor. SeeAzure Monitor terminology changesfor details.
With Connection Monitor for ExpressRoute, you can:
Monitor loss and latency across various VNets and set alerts.
Monitor all network paths, including redundant ones.
Troubleshoot transient and point-in-time network issues that are difficult to replicate.
Identify specific network segments responsible for degraded performance.
Workflow
Monitoring agents are installed on multiple servers, both on-premises and in Azure. These agents communicate by sending TCP handshake packets, allowing Azure to map the network topology and traffic paths.
Create a Log Analytics workspace.
Install and configure software agents (not required for Microsoft Peering only):Install monitoring agents on on-premises servers and Azure VMs (for private peering).Configure settings on monitoring agent servers to allow communication (for example, open firewall ports).
Install monitoring agents on on-premises servers and Azure VMs (for private peering).
Configure settings on monitoring agent servers to allow communication (for example, open firewall ports).
Configure network security group (NSG) rules to allow communication between monitoring agents on Azure VMs and on-premises agents.
Enable Network Watcher on your subscription.
Set up monitoring by creating connection monitors with test groups to monitor source and destination endpoints across your network.
If you're already using Network Performance Monitor (deprecated) or Connection Monitor and have a Log Analytics workspace in a supported region, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and start from step 3.
Create a workspace
Create a workspace in the subscription that has the VNets linked to the ExpressRoute circuit.
Sign in to theAzure portal. From the subscription with the virtual networks connected to your ExpressRoute circuit, select+ Create a resource. Search forLog Analytics Workspace, then selectCreate.NoteYou can create a new workspace or use an existing one. If using an existing workspace, ensure it's been migrated to the new query language.More information...

Configure monitoring solution
Complete the Azure PowerShell script by replacing the values for$SubscriptionId,$location,$resourceGroup, and$workspaceName. Then run the script to configure the monitoring solution.
$subscriptionId = "Subscription ID should come here"
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

$location = "Workspace location should come here"
$resourceGroup = "Resource group name should come here"
$workspaceName = "Workspace name should come here"

$solution = @{
    Location          = $location
    Properties        = @{
        workspaceResourceId
        workspaceResourceId = "/subscriptions/$($subscriptionId)/resourcegroups/$($resourceGroup)/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/$($workspaceName)"
    }
    Plan              = @{
        Name          = "NetworkMonitoring($($workspaceName))" 
        Publisher     = "Microsoft"
        Product       = "OMSGallery/NetworkMonitoring"
        PromotionCode = ""
    }
    ResourceName      = "NetworkMonitoring($($workspaceName))" 
    ResourceType      = "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions" 
    ResourceGroupName = $resourceGroup
}

New-AzResource @solution -Force
$subscriptionId = "Subscription ID should come here"
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

$location = "Workspace location should come here"
$resourceGroup = "Resource group name should come here"
$workspaceName = "Workspace name should come here"

$solution = @{
    Location          = $location
    Properties        = @{
        workspaceResourceId
        workspaceResourceId = "/subscriptions/$($subscriptionId)/resourcegroups/$($resourceGroup)/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/$($workspaceName)"
    }
    Plan              = @{
        Name          = "NetworkMonitoring($($workspaceName))" 
        Publisher     = "Microsoft"
        Product       = "OMSGallery/NetworkMonitoring"
        PromotionCode = ""
    }
    ResourceName      = "NetworkMonitoring($($workspaceName))" 
    ResourceType      = "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions" 
    ResourceGroupName = $resourceGroup
}

New-AzResource @solution -Force
Once you configure the monitoring solution, proceed to install and configure the monitoring agents on your servers.
Install and configure agents on-premises
Download the agent setup file
Navigate to theLog Analytics workspaceand selectAgents managementunderSettings. Download the agent that corresponds to your machine's operating system.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other on-premises machines you wish to monitor.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other on-premises machines you wish to monitor.
Install Network Watcher agent on each monitoring server
If creating a new Azure VM for monitoring connectivity, you can install the Network Watcher agent during VM creation.
If using an existing VM, install the Network Agent separately forLinuxandWindows.
Open firewall ports on monitoring agent servers
Ensure firewall rules allow TCP or ICMP packets between source and destination servers for connection monitoring.
Run theEnableRulesPowerShell script (downloaded earlier) in a PowerShell window with administrative privileges. This script creates the necessary registry keys and Windows Firewall rules.
Note
The script configures Windows Firewall rules only on the server where it's bring run. Ensure network firewalls allow traffic for the TCP port used by Connection Monitor.
Change port numbers manually:
Navigate to /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/npm_state.
Open the npmdregistry file.
Change the value for Port NumberPortNumber:<port of your choice>. Ensure the same port number is used across all agents in a workspace.
PortNumber:<port of your choice>
Configure Network Security Group rules
To monitor servers in Azure, configure NSG rules to allow TCP or ICMP traffic from Connection Monitor. The default port is8084.
For more information about NSG, see the tutorial onfiltering network traffic.
Note
Ensure agents are installed (both on-premises and Azure) and run the PowerShell script before proceeding.
Enable Network Watcher
Ensure Network Watcher is enabled for your subscription. For more information, seeEnable Network Watcher.
