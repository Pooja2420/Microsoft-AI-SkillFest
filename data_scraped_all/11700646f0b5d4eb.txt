Azure VMware Solution doesn't allow you to manage your private cloud with your on-premises vCenter Server. Instead, you need to connect to the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server instance through a jump box.
In this tutorial, learn how to create a jump box in the resource group that you created in theprevious tutorialand sign in to the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server. This jump box is a Windows virtual machine (VM) on the same virtual network you created.  It provides access to both vCenter Server and the NSX Manager.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a Windows VM to access the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server
Sign in to vCenter Server from this VM
Create a new Windows virtual machine
In the resource group, selectAdd, search forMicrosoft Windows 10, and select it. Then selectCreate.
In the resource group, selectAdd, search forMicrosoft Windows 10, and select it. Then selectCreate.

Enter the required information in the fields, and then selectReview + create.For more information on the fields, see the following table.FieldValueSubscriptionValue is prepopulated with the Subscription belonging to the Resource Group.Resource groupValue is prepopulated for the current Resource Group, which you created in the preceding tutorial.Virtual machine nameEnter a unique name for the VM.RegionSelect the geographical location of the VM.Availability optionsLeave the default value selected.ImageSelect the VM image.SizeLeave the default size value.Authentication typeSelectPassword.UsernameEnter the user name for logging on to the VM.PasswordEnter the password for logging on to the VM.Confirm passwordEnter the password for logging on to the VM.Public inbound portsSelectNone.To control access to the VM only when you want to access it, useJIT access.To securely access the jump box server from the internet without exposing any network port, use anAzure Bastion.

Connect to the vCenter Server of your private cloud
From the jump box, sign in to vSphere Client with VMware vCenter Server SSO using a cloudadmin username and verify that the user interface displays successfully.
