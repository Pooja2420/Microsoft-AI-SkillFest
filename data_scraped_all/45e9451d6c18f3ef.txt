Azure NetApp Files is an enterprise storage service that offers an ideal landing zone component in Azure to accelerate and simplify the migration of various workload categories. Azure NetApp Files provides a high-performance, scalable, and secure storage service for running mission-critical applications and workloads in Azure.
For businesses looking to migrate their applications and workloads to Azure, Azure NetApp Files provides a seamless experience for migrating Windows Apps and SQL server, Linux OSS Apps and Databases, and SAP on Azure. Azure NetApp Files' integration with Azure services makes the migration process easy, enabling users to move their workloads from on-premises to the cloud with minimal effort.
In addition to migration, Azure NetApp Files provides a platform for running specialized workloads in High-Performance Computing (HPC) like Analytics, Oil and Gas, and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). These specialized workloads require high-performance computing resources, and Azure NetApp Filesâ scalable and high-performance file storage solution provides the ideal platform for running these workloads in Azure. Azure NetApp Files also supports running Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) with Azure Virtual Desktop and Citrix, as well as Azure VMware Solution with guest OS mounts and datastores.
Azure NetApp Filesâ integration with Azure native services like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Batch, and Azure Machine Learning provides users with a seamless experience and enables them to leverage the full power of Azure's cloud-native services. This integration allows businesses to run their workloads in a scalable, secure, and highly performant environment, providing them with the confidence they need to run mission-critical workloads in the cloud.
The following diagram depicts the categorization of reference architectures, blueprints and solutions on this page as laid out in the above introduction:
