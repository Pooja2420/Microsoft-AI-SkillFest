AzAcSnap 11 (Build: 1BA0C3*)
AzAcSnap 11 is being released with the following fixes and improvements:
Features moved to GA (generally available):Microsoft SQL Server 2022 on Windows.
Microsoft SQL Server 2022 on Windows.
Dependency updates:Updated to .NET 8List of supported operation systems.NET 8 - Supported OS versions.Azure SDK updated to Track 2 (latest security and performance improvements).

List of supported operation systems.NET 8 - Supported OS versions.
Azure SDK updated to Track 2 (latest security and performance improvements).
Fixes and Improvements:(NEW) Configurable Data Volume Backup Attempts:This feature allows you to set the number of times the system will try to perform a data volume backup. It's useful for databases where locking issues might occur. By default, the system will try 3 times, but you can set it to any number from 1. You can configure this by adding theDATA_BACKUP_ATTEMPTSvariable to the.azacsnaprcfile or as an environment variable.  Currently, this feature is only available for Microsoft SQL Server.  For details on configuration refer to theglobal override settings to control AzAcSnap behavior.Backup (-c backup) changes:Storage snapshot retention management moved to after database taken out of "backup-mode" to reduce time the database is in a "backup-enabled" state.

AzAcSnap 7 (Build: 1A8FDFF)
AzAcSnap 7 is being released with the following fixes and improvements:
Fixes and Improvements:Backup (-c backup) changes:Shorten suffix added to the snapshot name. The previous 26 character suffix of "YYYY-MM-DDThhhhss-nnnnnnnZ" was too long. The suffix is now an 11 character hex-decimal based on the ten-thousandths of a second since the Unix epoch to avoid naming collisions, for example, F2D212540D5.Increased validation when creating snapshots to avoid failures on snapshot creation retry.Time out when executing AzAcSnap mechanism to disable/enable backint (autoDisableEnableBackint=true) now aligns with other SAP HANA related operation time-out values.Azure Backup now allows third party snapshot-based backups without impact to streaming backups (also known as "backint"). Therefore, AzAcSnap "backint" detection logic is reordered to allow for future deprecation of this feature. By default this setting is disabled (autoDisableEnableBackint=false). For customers who relied on this feature to take snapshots with AzAcSnap and use Azure Backup, keeping this value as true means AzAcSnap 7 continues to disable/enable backint. As this setting is no longer necessary for Azure Backup, we recommend testing AzAcSnap backups with the value ofautoDisableEnableBackint=false, and then if successful make the same change in your production deployment.Restore (-c restore) changes:Ability to create a custom suffix for Volume clones created when using-c restore --restore snaptovoleither:via the command-line with--clonesuffix <custom suffix>.interactively when running the command without the--forceoption.When doing a--restore snaptovolon ANF, then Volume Clone inherits the new "NetworkFeatures" setting from the Source Volume.Can now do a restore if there are no Data Volumes configured.

AzAcSnap 6 (Build: 1A5F0B8)
Important
AzAcSnap 6 brings a new release model for AzAcSnap and includes fully supported GA features and Preview features in a single release.
Since AzAcSnap v5.0 was released as GA in April 2021, there has been eight releases of AzAcSnap across two branches. Our goal with the new release model is to align with how Azure components are released. This change allows moving features from Preview to GA (without having to move an entire branch), and introduce new Preview features (without having to create a new branch). From AzAcSnap 6, we have a single branch with fully supported GA features and Preview features (which are subject to Microsoft's Preview Ts&Cs). Itâs important to note customers can't accidentally use Preview features, and must enable them with the--previewcommand line option. Therefore the next release will be AzAcSnap 7, which could include; patches (if necessary) for GA features, current Preview features moving to GA, or new Preview features.
--preview
AzAcSnap 6 is being released with the following fixes and improvements:
Features moved to GA (generally available):Oracle Database support.Backint integration to work with Azure Backup.RunBefore/RunAfter command line options to execute custom shell scripts and commands before or after taking storage snapshots.
Oracle Database support.
Backint integration to work with Azure Backup.
RunBefore/RunAfter command line options to execute custom shell scripts and commands before or after taking storage snapshots.
Features in Preview:Azure Key Vault to store Service Principal content.Azure Managed Disk as an alternate storage back-end.
Azure Key Vault to store Service Principal content.
Azure Managed Disk as an alternate storage back-end.
ANF Client API Version updated to 2021-10-01.

AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220203.77807)
AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220203.77807) is released with the following fixes and improvements:
Minor update to resolve STDOUT buffer limitations. Now the list of Oracle table files put into archive-mode is sent to an external file rather than output in the main AzAcSnap log file. The external file is in the same location and basename as the log file, but with a ".protected-tables" extension (output filename detailed in the AzAcSnap log file). It's overwritten each timeazacsnapruns.

AzAcSnap v5.0.2 (Build: 20210827.19086) - Patch update to v5.0.1
AzAcSnap v5.0.2 (Build: 20210827.19086) is provided as a patch update to the v5.0 branch with the following fixes and improvements:
Ignoressh255 exit codes. In some cases thesshcommand, which is used to communicate with storage on Azure Large Instance, would emit an exit code of 255 when there were no errors or execution failures (referman ssh"EXIT STATUS") - then AzAcSnap would trap this exit code as a failure and abort. With this update extra verification is done to validate correct execution, this validation includes parsingsshSTDOUT and STDERR for errors in addition to traditional exit code checks.
ssh
ssh
man ssh
ssh
Fix the installer's check for the location of the hdbuserstore. The installer would search the filesystem for an incorrect source directory for the hdbuserstore location for the user running the install - the installer now searches for~/.hdb. This fix is applicable to systems (for example, Azure Large Instance) where the hdbuserstore was preconfigured for therootuser before installingazacsnap.
~/.hdb
root
azacsnap
Installer now shows the version it will install/extract (if the installer is run without any arguments).

AzAcSnap v5.0.1 (Build: 20210524.14837) - Patch update to v5.0
AzAcSnap v5.0.1 (Build: 20210524.14837) is provided as a patch update to the v5.0 branch with the following fixes and improvements:
Improved exit code handling. In some cases AzAcSnap would emit an exit code of 0 (zero), even after an execution failure when the exit code should be non-zero. Exit codes should now only be zero on successfully runningazacsnapto completion and non-zero if there's any failure.
azacsnap
AzAcSnap's internal error handling is extended to capture and emit the exit code of the external commands run by AzAcSnap.
April-2021
AzAcSnap v5.0 (Build: 20210421.6349) - GA Released (21-April-2021)
AzAcSnap v5.0 (Build: 20210421.6349) is now Generally Available and for this build had the following fixes and improvements:
The hdbsql retry time-out (to wait for a response from SAP HANA) is automatically set to half of the "savePointAbortWaitSeconds" to avoid race conditions. The setting for "savePointAbortWaitSeconds" can be modified directly in the JSON configuration file and must be a minimum of 600 seconds.
March-2021
AzAcSnap v5.0 Preview (Build: 20210318.30771)
AzAcSnap v5.0 Preview (Build: 20210318.30771) is released with the following fixes and improvements:
Removed the need to add the AZACSNAP user into the SAP HANA Tenant DBs, see theEnable communication with databasesection.
Fix to allow arestorewith volumes configured with Manual QOS.
Added mutex control to throttle SSH connections for Azure Large Instance.
Fix installer for handling path names with spaces and other related issues.
