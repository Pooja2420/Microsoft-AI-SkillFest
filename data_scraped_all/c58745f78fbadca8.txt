You can selectQuotaunder Settings of Azure NetApp Files to display the current and default quota sizes for the region.
For example:

Request regional capacity quota increase
You cansubmit a support requestfor an increase of a regional capacity quota without incurring extra cost. The support request you submit is sent to the Azure capacity management team for processing. You typically receive a response within two business days. The Azure capacity management team might contact you if you have a large request.
A regional capacity quota increase doesn't incur a billing increase. Billing is still based on the provisioned capacity pools.
For example, if you currently have 25 TiB of provisioned capacity, you can request a quota increase to 35 TiB.  Within two business days, your quota increase is applied to the requested region. When the quota increase is applied, you still pay for only the current provisioned capacity (25 TiB). But when you actually provision the additional 10 TiB, you're billed for 35 TiB.
