An Azure API Management service instance can scale automatically based on a set of rules. This behavior can be enabled and configured throughAzure Monitor autoscale.
The article walks through the process of configuring autoscale and suggests optimal configuration of autoscale rules.
Note
In service tiers that support multiple scale units, you can alsomanually scaleyour API Management instance.
An API Management service in theConsumptiontier scales automatically based on the traffic - without any additional configuration needed.
Currently, autoscale is not supported for theworkspace gatewayin API Management workspaces.
Important
Changes to your API Management service's infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration.
While the service is updating, other service infrastructure changes can't be made. However, you can configure APIs, products, policies, and user settings. The service will not experience gateway downtime (except in the Developer tier).
Prerequisites
To follow the steps from this article, you must:
Have an active Azure subscription.
Have an Azure API Management instance. For more information, seeCreate an Azure API Management instance.
Understand the concept ofcapacityof an API Management instance.
Understandmanual scalingof an API Management instance, including cost consequences.
Azure API Management autoscale limitations
Certain limitations and consequences of scaling decisions need to be considered before configuring autoscale behavior.
Thepricing tierof your API Management instance determines themaximum number of unitsyou may scale to. For example, theStandard tiercan be scaled to 4 units. You can add any number of units to thePremiumtier.
If the service is locked by another operation, the scaling request will fail and retry automatically.
If your service instance is deployed in multiple regions (locations), only units in thePrimary locationcan be autoscaled with Azure Monitor autoscale. Units in other locations can only be scaled manually.
If your service instance is configured withavailability zonesin thePrimary location, be aware of the number of zones when configuring autoscaling. The number of API Management units in autoscale rules and limits must be a multiple of the number of zones.
Enable and configure autoscale for an API Management instance
Follow these steps to configure autoscale for an Azure API Management service:
Sign in to theAzure portal, and navigate to your API Management instance.

Define a new scale-out rule.For example, a scale-out rule could trigger addition of 1 API Management unit, when the average capacity metric over the previous 30 minutes exceeds 70%.

For considerations on setting this threshold, seeUsing capacity for scaling decisions.Duration (in minutes)30The timespan to average the capacity metric over is specific to usage patterns. The longer the duration, the smoother the reaction will be. Intermittent spikes will have less effect on the scale-out decision. However, it will also delay the scale-out trigger.Time grain statisticAverageActionOperationIncrease count byInstance count1Scale out the Azure API Management instance by 1 unit.Cool down (minutes)60In most cases, the cool down period of 60 minutes prevents from triggering many scale-outs.
