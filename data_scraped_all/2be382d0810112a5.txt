Important
Azure Stack HCI is now part of Azure Local.Learn more.
This article provides an overview of the Azure Arc gateway for Azure Local. The Arc gateway can be enabled on new deployments of Azure Local running software version 2408 and later. This article also describes how to create and delete the Arc gateway resource in Azure.
You can use the Arc gateway to significantly reduce the number of required endpoints needed to deploy and manage Azure Local instances. When you create the Arc gateway, you can connect to and use it for new deployments of Azure Local.
Important
This feature is currently in PREVIEW.
See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
How it works
The Arc gateway works by introducing the following components:
Arc gateway resourceâ¯â An Azure resource that acts as a common entry point for Azure traffic. This gateway resource has a specific domain or URL that you can use. When you create the Arc gateway resource, this domain or URL is a part of the success response.

Arc proxyâ¯â A new component that is added to the Arc Agentry. This component runs as a service (Called  theAzure Arc Proxy) and works as a forward proxy for the Azure Arc agents and extensions. The gateway router doesn't need any configuration from your side. This router is part of the Arc core agentry and runs within the context of an Arc-enabled resource.

When you integrate the Arc gateway with version 2411 of Azure Local deployments, each machine gets Arc proxy along with other Arc Agents.
When Arc gateway is used, thehttpandhttpstraffic flow changes as follows:
Traffic flow for Azure Local host operating system components
OS proxy settings are used to route all HTTPS host traffic through Arc proxy.

From Arc proxy, the traffic is forwarded to Arc gateway.
From Arc proxy, the traffic is forwarded to Arc gateway.
Based on the configuration in the Arc gateway, if allowed, the traffic is sent to target services. If not allowed, Arc proxy redirects this traffic to the enterprise proxy (or direct outbound if no proxy set). Arc proxy automatically determines the right path for the endpoint.

The routable IP (failover clustered IP resource as of now) is used to forward the traffic through Arc proxy running on the Azure Local host machines.

Once the traffic reaches Arc proxy, the remaining flow takes the same path as described. If traffic to the target service is allowed, it is sent to Arc gateway. If not, it is sent to the enterprise proxy (or direct outbound if no proxy set). For AKS specifically, this path is used for downloading docker images for Arc Agentry and Arc Extension Pods.

Traffic flow for Azure Local VMs
Httpandhttpstraffic are forwarded to the enterprise proxy. Arc proxy inside an Azure Local VM enabled by Arc is not yet supported in this version.
Traffic flows are illustrated in the following diagram:

Supported and unsupported scenarios
You can use the Arc gateway in the following scenario for Azure Local versions 2411.1 or later:
Enable Arc gateway during deployment of new Azure Local instances running versions 2411.1 or later.
The Arc gateway resource must be created on the same subscription where you are planning to deploy your Azure Local instance.
Unsupported scenarios for Azure Local include:
Enabling Arc gateway after deployment is not supported.
Azure Local endpoints not redirected
The endpoints from the table are required and must be allowlisted in your proxy or firewall to deploy the Azure Local instance:

Restrictions and limitations
Consider the following limitations of Arc gateway in this release:
TLS terminating proxies aren't supported with the Arc gateway preview.
Use of ExpressRoute, Site-to-Site VPN, or Private Endpoints in addition to the Arc gateway (preview) isn't supported.
Create the Arc gateway resource in Azure
You can create an Arc gateway resource using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.
Portal
CLI
PowerShell
Sign in toAzure portal.
Go to theAzure Arc > Azure Arc gatewaypage, then selectCreate.
Select the subscription where you are planning to deploy your Azure Local instance.
ForName, enter the name for the Arc gateway resource.
ForLocation, enter the region where the Arc gateway resource should live. An Arc gateway resource is used by any Arc-enabled resource in the same Azure tenant.
SelectNext.
On theTagspage, specify one or more custom tags to support your standards.
SelectReview & Create.
Review your details, and then selectCreate.
The gateway creation process takes nine to 10 minutes to complete.
Add the arc gateway extension to your Azure CLI:az extension add -n arcgateway
Add the arc gateway extension to your Azure CLI:
az extension add -n arcgateway
az extension add -n arcgateway
On a machine with access to Azure, run the following commands to create your Arc gateway resource:az arcgateway create --name [gateway name] --resource-group [resource group] --location [location]The gateway creation process takes 9-10 minutes to complete.
On a machine with access to Azure, run the following commands to create your Arc gateway resource:
az arcgateway create --name [gateway name] --resource-group [resource group] --location [location]
az arcgateway create --name [gateway name] --resource-group [resource group] --location [location]
The gateway creation process takes 9-10 minutes to complete.
On a machine with access to Azure, run the following PowerShell command to create your Arc gateway resource:
New-AzArcgateway 
-name <gateway name> 
-resource-group <resource group> 
-location <region> 
-subscription <subscription name or id> 
-gateway-type public  
-allowed-features *
New-AzArcgateway 
-name <gateway name> 
-resource-group <resource group> 
-location <region> 
-subscription <subscription name or id> 
-gateway-type public  
-allowed-features *
The gateway creation process takes 9-10 minutes to complete.
Detach or change the Arc gateway association from the machine
To detach the gateway resource from your Arc-enabled server, set the gateway resource ID tonull. To attach your Arc-enabled server to another Arc gateway resource just update the name and resource ID with the new Arc gateway information:
null
az arcgateway settings update --resource-group <Resource Group> --subscription <subscription name> --base-provider Microsoft.HybridCompute --base-resource-type machines --base-resource-name <Arc-enabled server name> --gateway-resource-id "
az arcgateway settings update --resource-group <Resource Group> --subscription <subscription name> --base-provider Microsoft.HybridCompute --base-resource-type machines --base-resource-name <Arc-enabled server name> --gateway-resource-id "
Delete the Arc gateway resource
Before deleting an Arc gateway resource, ensure that no machines are attached. To delete the gateway resource, run the following command:
az arcgateway delete --resource group <resource group name> --gateway-name <gateway resource name>
az arcgateway delete --resource group <resource group name> --gateway-name <gateway resource name>
This operation can take a couple of minutes.
