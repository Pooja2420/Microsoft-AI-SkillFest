This article contains all the monitoring reference information for this service.
SeeMonitor Azure Functionsfor details on the data you can collect for Azure Functions and how to use it.
SeeMonitor executions in Azure Functionsfor details on using Application Insights to collect and analyze log data from individual functions in your function app.
Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list ofall platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor.
For information on metric retention, seeAzure Monitor Metrics overview.
Hosting plans that allow your apps to scale dynamically support extra Functions-specific metrics:
Consumption plan
Flex Consumption plan
These metrics are used specifically whenestimating Consumption plan costs.
These metrics are used to estimate the costs associated withon demandandalways readymeters used for billing in a [Flex Consumption plan]:
OnDemandFunctionExecutionCount / 10
AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionCount / 10
OnDemandFunctionExecutionUnits / 1,024,000
AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionUnits / 1,024,000
AlwaysReadyUnits / 1,024,000
In this table, all execution units are calculated by multiplying the fixed instance memory size, such as 2,048 MB or 4,096 MB, by total execution times, in milliseconds.
Supported metrics for Microsoft.Web/sites
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Web/sites resource type. Most of these metrics apply to both function app and web apps, which both run on App Service.
Note
These metrics aren't available when your function app runs on Linux in aConsumption plan.
All columns might not be present in every table.
Some columns might be beyond the viewing area of the page. SelectExpand tableto view all available columns.
Table headings
Category- The metrics group or classification.
Metric- The metric display name as it appears in the Azure portal.
Name in REST API- The metric name as referred to in theREST API.
Unit- Unit of measure.
Aggregation- The defaultaggregationtype. Valid values: Average (Avg), Minimum (Min), Maximum (Max), Total (Sum), Count.
Dimensions-Dimensionsavailable for the metric.
Time Grains-Intervalsat which the metric is sampled. For example,PT1Mindicates that the metric is sampled every minute,PT30Mevery 30 minutes,PT1Hevery hour, and so on.
PT1M
PT30M
PT1H
DS Export- Whether the metric is exportable to Azure Monitor Logs via diagnostic settings. For information on exporting metrics, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
