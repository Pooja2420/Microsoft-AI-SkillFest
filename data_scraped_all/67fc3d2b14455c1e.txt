Azure Pipelines
Add Azure Pipelines from the GitHub Marketplace
A newAzure Pipelinesappin the GitHub Marketplaceexpands integration with GitHub repositories and streamlines parallel job purchases.
Previously, you could enable continuous integration with GitHub repositories through OAuth authentication. Using OAuth, Azure Pipelines usesan individual's GitHub identityto fetch code and update build status on GitHub. However, since the members of your team may change over time, it can be less-desirable to use an individualâs GitHub identity and permissions. By installing the Azure Pipelines app, you can authorizethe appto perform actions instead.
Also, when you use the app, build results are made available in GitHubâs newChecksfeature with a detailed view of build, test, and code coverage results.
To get started, install the appfrom the GitHub Marketplaceinto your GitHub account or organization. You can also purchase additional parallel jobs with an existing GitHub payment account instead of a separate Azure account. Pricing is the same either way.

Build open source projects with Azure Pipelines for free
Azure Pipelines provides cloud-hosted pipelines for Linux, macOS, and Windows with unlimited minutes and 10 free parallel jobs for open source.
See thebuild public repositoriesandparallel jobsdocumentation for more information.
Configure builds using YAML
Important
To use this capability, you must have theBuild YAML pipelinespreview featureenabled on your organization.
YAML-based build pipelines are now broadly available. Automate your continuous integration pipeline using aYAML file checked into the repositoryalongside the rest of your code. It's easy to get started with a single-job build. As your needs grow, easily scale out usingmultiple jobs,external templates, andmatrix execution.
Create YAML build pipelines using the new wizard
Important
To use this capability, you must have theNew YAML pipeline creation experiencepreview featureenabled on your profile or organization.
A new wizard simplifies this process of creating YAML-based build pipelines with GitHub and Azure Repos. Once you choose a repository to build, a pipeline will automatically be created if it contains a YAML file. Otherwise, Azure Pipelines will analyze your repository and recommend a YAML-based template for building your project. Just clickSave and runto create a pull request for the suggested YAML and run the first build. Continuous integration and pull request triggers will be enabled automatically.

Manage build pipelines using the new Builds page
Important
To use this capability, you must have theNew builds hubpreview featureenabled on your profile or organization.
We are making several improvements and rolling out a new version of theBuildspage. This new version combines the directory of all your build pipelines and the list of current builds so that you can quickly navigate across your project's builds to see their status. It also includes a preview of test analytics for the selected pipeline.

Rebuild GitHub pull request builds
When you submit a pull request to your GitHub repository, the pull request build could fail due to an intermittent failure, such as a package registry being unavailable or a flaky test. In these cases, you would want to run the build one more time. Currently, this requires you to push another artificial update to the pull request. Now, in thenewBuildspageyou can simply select the failed build and queue another one.
This gesture to rebuild will only be available for pull request builds to start with. We are looking into making a similar feature available for all failed builds.
New build status badge URL
Build badges embedded into the homepage of a repository are a common way to show the health of the repository. We added new URLs to help you construct build badges. The new URLs allow users to publish a per-branch status and can take users to the latest build of the selected branch. You can get the Markdown for the new status badge URL by selecting theStatus badgemenu action in thenewBuildspage. For backward compatibility, we will continue to honor the older build badge URLs.
Leverage even more tools on Microsoft-hosted Linux agents
In this update, several build, test, and deployment tools have been added to theMicrosoft-hosted Linux agents, which removes the need to install them yourself during a build or release.
Erlang/OTP
Firefox
Haskell
Heroku CLI
ImageMagick
Mercurial
Microsoft SQL Server Client Tools
MySQL Server
PhantomJS
Pollinate
PyPy2 and PyPy3
rebar
rsync
ShellCheck
Sphinx
Terraform
Xvfb
Track GitHub commits and associated issues in releases
Knowing the changes that are getting deployed with a release is important to track improvements to the app. Now you can get the list of commits made in GitHub repos and the associated GitHub issues that are being deployed with a release.

Manage build and deployment completion emails better using improved formatting
Build and deployment completion emails have been updated to be more filterable by email rules. Now the subject line includes more relevant information at a glance, the body contains more details, and their styling has been refreshed with the latest brand.
Elements of the new format are:
[Build result] [pipeline name] - [repository:branch] - [project name] - [commit]
[Build result] [pipeline name] - [repository:branch] - [project name] - [commit]
[Deployment result] [pipeline name] > [release name] : [stage name]
[Deployment result] [pipeline name] > [release name] : [stage name]
Here are a few examples:
[Build succeeded] IdentityService.CI - MyRepo:master - MyProject - d3b90b80
[Build succeeded] IdentityService.CI - MyRepo:master - MyProject - d3b90b80
[Deployment succeeded] New release pipeline > NotificationSpecialRelease-1 : Stage 1
[Deployment succeeded] New release pipeline > NotificationSpecialRelease-1 : Stage 1
Follow the new unified Azure Pipelines terminology
Throughout builds and releases, different terms have been used historically for similar concepts. In other cases, meanings of terms were vague. For example, telling the difference between anagent pooland anagent queue.
Terminology has been unified in Azure Pipelines to clarify its concepts. You'll now see the following unified terms:
See theConceptsdocumentation for more information.
Marketplace
Leverage the latest extension categories
As an extension contributor you will notice that extension categories have been aligned to match the renamed Azure DevOps Services in theMarketplace. Although the previous categories have been automatically mapped to the new ones, we recommend switching to the new categories by updating your extension's manifest. See theManifestdocumentation for more information.
Administration
Switch existing organizations to use the new domain name URL
Although we've moved to the newdev.azure.comdomain name as the URL for new organizations, you'll be able to continue accessing your organization using thevisualstudio.comdomain, as usual. If you'd like to change your URL to be based ondev.azure.com, an organization administrator (Project Collection Administrator) can change this from the organization settings page. Although adopting the new domain name won't redirect every request, any request to the root URL of the organization and links from many email and web-based links will change.
dev.azure.com
visualstudio.com
dev.azure.com

We will make the move to the new URL gradually based on customer feedback. It will start as opt-in, then later we will make it the default for organizations. We have yet to set a timeline for deliberately moving organizations away from thevisualstudio.comdomain.
visualstudio.com
Important
To ensure your organization works with any existing firewall or IP restrictions, ensure that the appropriate domain names and IP addresses are allowed. See thisagent Q&A sectionfor more information.
Add Stakeholder users to save on Azure Pipelines license costs
Important
To use this capability, you must have theFree access to Pipelines for Stakeholderspreview featureenabled on your organization.
Good news! If you are only using the Azure Pipelines service, you do not have to pay for users anymore through Basic licenses. All features of Azure Pipelines are available for free to all users. As you add more users to your project, let them remain as Stakeholders for free, and they will be able to create, view, update, and approve pipelines, provided they have the appropriate permissions. Here are some additional notes on this licensing change:
You only pay for additional parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines. Users are unlimited.
All access to Azure Pipelines features is still governed through a security and permissions model.
If you use other Azure DevOps Services, you still have to pay a per-user license for those services after the free limits.
In existing organizations, Stakeholders do not get the free Azure Pipelines benefit by default. Your organization administrator (Project Collection Administrator) has to explicitly enable this preview feature. Enabling this preview feature will change the behavior of what Stakeholders can do. Currently, they cannot manage builds or releases. But, once the preview feature is enabled, there is no difference between Basic users and Stakeholders in Azure Pipelines. It is for this reason that the choice of allowing Stakeholders to be treated as free Azure Pipelines users is left to your administrator.
See theProvide Stakeholders access to edit build and release pipelinesdocumentation for more information.
