In this article
This article lists the endpoints, ports, and protocols required for Azure Arc-enabled services and features.
Generally, connectivity requirements include these principles:
All connections are TCP unless otherwise specified.
All HTTP connections use HTTPS and SSL/TLS with officially signed and verifiable certificates.
All connections are outbound unless otherwise specified.
To use a proxy, verify that the agents and the machine performing the onboarding process meet the network requirements in this article.
Tip
For the Azure public cloud, you can reduce the number of required endpoints by using the Azure Arc gateway forArc-enabled serversorArc-enabled Kubernetes.
Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes endpoints
Connectivity to the Arc Kubernetes-based endpoints is required for all Kubernetes-based Arc offerings, including:
Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes
Azure Container Apps on Azure Arc
Azure Arc-enabled Machine Learning
Azure Arc-enabled data services (direct connectivity mode only)
Azure Cloud
Azure Government
Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet

Azure Arc-enabled data services
This section describes requirements specific to Azure Arc-enabled data services, in addition to the Arc-enabled Kubernetes endpoints listed above.
arcdataservicesrow1.azurecr.io
*.ods.opinsights.azure.com
*.oms.opinsights.azure.com
*.monitoring.azure.com

1Requirement depends on deployment mode:
For direct mode, the controller pod on the Kubernetes cluster needs to have outbound connectivity to the endpoints to send the logs, metrics, inventory, and billing information to Azure Monitor/Data Processing Service.
For indirect mode, the machine that runsaz arcdata dc uploadneeds to have the outbound connectivity to Azure Monitor and Data Processing Service.
az arcdata dc upload

Azure Monitor APIs
Connectivity from Azure Data Studio to the Kubernetes API server uses the Kubernetes authentication and encryption that you have established.  Each user that is using Azure Data Studio or CLI must have an authenticated connection to the Kubernetes API to perform many of the actions related to Azure Arc-enabled data services.
For more information, seeConnectivity modes and requirements.
Azure Arc-enabled servers
Connectivity to Arc-enabled server endpoints is required for:
SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc
SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere*
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere*
Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager*
Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager*
Azure Arc-enabled Azure Stack (HCI)**Only required for guest management enabled.
Azure Arc-enabled Azure Stack (HCI)*
*Only required for guest management enabled.
Azure Arc-enabled server endpoints are required for all server based Arc offerings.
Networking configuration
The Azure Connected Machine agent for Linux and Windows communicates outbound securely to Azure Arc over TCP port 443. By default, the agent uses the default route to the internet to reach Azure services. You can optionallyconfigure the agent to use a proxy serverif your network requires it. Proxy servers don't make the Connected Machine agent more secure because the traffic is already encrypted.
To further secure your network connectivity to Azure Arc, instead of using public networks and proxy servers, you can implement anAzure Arc Private Link Scope.
Note
Azure Arc-enabled servers does not support using aLog Analytics gatewayas a proxy for the Connected Machine agent. At the same time, Azure Monitor Agent supports Log Analytics gateway.
If outbound connectivity is restricted by your firewall or proxy server, make sure the URLs and Service Tags listed below are not blocked.
Service tags
Be sure to allow access to the following Service Tags:
AzureActiveDirectory
AzureTrafficManager
AzureResourceManager
AzureArcInfrastructure
Storage
WindowsAdminCenter (ifusing Windows Admin Center to manage Arc-enabled servers)
For a list of IP addresses for each service tag/region, see the JSON fileAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags â Public Cloud. Microsoft publishes weekly updates containing each Azure Service and the IP ranges it uses. This information in the JSON file is the current point-in-time list of the IP ranges that correspond to each service tag. The IP addresses are subject to change. If IP address ranges are required for your firewall configuration, then theAzureCloudService Tag should be used to allow access to all Azure services. Do not disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs, allow them as you would other Internet traffic.
If you filter traffic to the AzureArcInfrastructure service tag, you must allow traffic to the full service tag range. The ranges advertised for individual regions, for example AzureArcInfrastructure.AustraliaEast, do not include the IP ranges used by global components of the service. The specific IP address resolved for these endpoints may change over time within the documented ranges, so just using a lookup tool to identify the current IP address for a given endpoint and allowing access to that will not be sufficient to ensure reliable access.
For more information, seeVirtual network service tags.
URLs
The table below lists the URLs that must be available in order to install and use the Connected Machine agent.
Azure Cloud
Azure Government
Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet
Note
When configuring the Azure connected machine agent to communicate with Azure through a private link, some endpoints must still be accessed through the internet. ThePrivate link capablecolumn in the following table shows which endpoints can be configured with a private endpoint. If the column showsPublicfor an endpoint, you must still allow access to that endpoint through your organization's firewall and/or proxy server for the agent to function. Network traffic is routed through private endpoint if a private link scope is assigned.

Transport Layer Security 1.2 protocol
To ensure the security of data in transit to Azure, we strongly encourage you to configure machine to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. Older versions of TLS/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) have been found to be vulnerable and while they still currently work to allow backwards compatibility, they arenot recommended.
The SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc endpoints located at *.<region>.arcdataservices.com only support TLS 1.2 and 1.3. Only Windows Server 2012 R2 and higher have support for TLS 1.2. SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc telemetry endpoint is not supported for Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2.
Subset of endpoints for ESU only
If you're using Azure Arc-enabled servers only for Extended Security Updates for either or both of the following products:
Windows Server 2012
SQL Server 2012
You can enable the following subset of endpoints:
