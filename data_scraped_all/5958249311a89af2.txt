When a user requests your content, the content is served to users in all locations. You might want to restrict access to your content by country/region.
With thegeo-filteringfeature, you can create rules on specific paths on your CDN endpoint. You can set the rules to allow or block content in selected countries/regions.
Important
Azure CDN Standard from Microsoftprofiles do not support path-based geo-filtering.
Standard profiles
These instructions are for andAzure CDN Standard from Edgioprofiles.
ForAzure CDN Premium from Edgioprofiles, you must use theManageportal to activate geo-filtering. For more information, seeAzure CDN Premium from Edgio profiles.
Define the directory path
To access the geo-filtering feature, select your CDN endpoint within the portal, then selectGeo-filteringunder SETTINGS in the left-hand menu.

From thePATHbox, specify the relative path to the location to which users are allowed or denied access.
You can apply geo-filtering for all your files with a forward slash (/) or select specific folders by specifying directory paths (for example,/pictures/). You can also apply geo-filtering to a single file (for example/pictures/city.png). Multiple rules are allowed. After you enter a rule, a blank row appears for you to enter the next rule.
For example, all of the following directory path filters are valid:
/
/Photos/
/Photos/Strasbourg/
/Photos/Strasbourg/city.png
Define the type of action
From theACTIONlist, selectAlloworBlock:
Allow:Only users from the specified countries/regions are allowed access to assets requested from the recursive path.
Allow:Only users from the specified countries/regions are allowed access to assets requested from the recursive path.
Block:Users from the specified countries/regions are denied access to the assets requested from the recursive path. If no other country/region filtering options have been configured for that location, then all other users are allowed access.
Block:Users from the specified countries/regions are denied access to the assets requested from the recursive path. If no other country/region filtering options have been configured for that location, then all other users are allowed access.
For example, a geo-filtering rule for blocking the path/Photos/Strasbourg/filters the following files:
http://<endpoint>.azureedge.net/Photos/Strasbourg/1000.jpghttp://<endpoint>.azureedge.net/Photos/Strasbourg/Cathedral/1000.jpg
Define the countries/regions
From theCOUNTRY/REGION CODESlist, select the countries/regions that you want to block or allow for the path.
After you have finished selecting the countries/regions, selectSaveto activate the new geo-filtering rule.

Clean up resources
To delete a rule, select it from the list on theGeo-filteringpage, then chooseDelete.

The geo-filtering configuration associated with the relative path is applied recursively to that path.
The geo-filtering configuration associated with the relative path is applied recursively to that path.
Only one rule can be applied to the same relative path. That is, you can't create multiple country/region filters that point to the same relative path. However, because country/region filters are recursive, a folder can have multiple country/region filters. In other words, a subfolder of a previously configured folder can be assigned a different country/region filter.
