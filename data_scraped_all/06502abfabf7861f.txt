Azure Load Balancer supports two distribution modes for distributing traffic to your applications:
Hash-based
Source IP affinity
To learn more about the different distribution modes supported by Azure Load Balancer, seeAzure Load Balancer distribution modes.
In this article, you learn how to configure the distribution mode for your Azure Load Balancer.
Configure distribution mode
Azure portal
PowerShell
CLI
You can change the configuration of the distribution mode by modifying the load-balancing rule in the portal.
Sign in to the Azure portal and locate the resource group containing the load balancer you wish to change by clicking onResource Groups.
In the load balancer overview screen, selectLoad-balancing rulesunderSettings.
In the load-balancing rules screen, select the load-balancing rule that you wish to change the distribution mode.
Under the rule, the distribution mode is changed by changing theSession persistencedrop-down box.
The following options are available:
None (hash-based)- Specifies that successive requests from the same client can be handled by any virtual machine.
Client IP (two-tuple: source IP and destination IP)- Specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address are handled by the same virtual machine.
Client IP and protocol (three-tuple: source IP, destination IP, and protocol type)- Specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination are handled by the same virtual machine.
Choose the distribution mode and then selectSave.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Use PowerShell to change the load-balancer distribution settings on an existing load-balancing rule. The following command updates the distribution mode:
$lb = Get-AzLoadBalancer -Name MyLoadBalancer -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroupLB
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].LoadDistribution = 'default'
Set-AzLoadBalancer -LoadBalancer $lb
$lb = Get-AzLoadBalancer -Name MyLoadBalancer -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroupLB
$lb.LoadBalancingRules[0].LoadDistribution = 'default'
Set-AzLoadBalancer -LoadBalancer $lb
Set the value of theLoadDistributionelement for the type of load balancing required.

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use.

Use Azure CLI to change the load-balancer distribution settings on an existing load-balancing rule. The following command updates the distribution mode:
az network lb rule update \
    --lb-name myLoadBalancer \
    --load-distribution Default \
    --name myHTTPRule \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupLB
az network lb rule update \
    --lb-name myLoadBalancer \
    --load-distribution Default \
    --name myHTTPRule \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupLB
Set the value of--load-distributionfor the type of load balancing required.
