This article provides a high-level overview of the workflows for service provisioning and routing configuration for ExpressRoute circuits.
Workflow steps
1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met. For a complete list, seePrerequisites and checklist.
An Azure subscription is created.
Physical connectivity is established with the ExpressRoute partner or configured via ExpressRoute Direct. ReviewLocations and partnersfor details.
2. Order connectivity or configure ExpressRoute Direct
Order connectivity from the service provider or configure ExpressRoute Direct.
Order connectivity from the service provider. Contact your provider for details.
Select the ExpressRoute partner
Select the peering location
Select the bandwidth
Select the billing model
Choose standard or premium add-on
View available ExpressRoute Direct capacity.
Reserve ports by creating the ExpressRoute Direct resource in your Azure subscription.
Request and receive the Letter of Authorization and order the physical cross connections.
Enable admin state and monitor usingAzure Monitor.
3. Create an ExpressRoute circuit
Verify readiness with the ExpressRoute partner. FollowCreate an ExpressRoute circuitto create your circuit.
Ensure physical link and admin state are enabled. FollowHow to configure ExpressRoute Direct. UseCreate an ExpressRoute circuitto create your circuit.
4. Service provider provisions connectivity
For the ExpressRoute partner model:
Provide the service key (s-key) to the provider.
Provide additional information (for example, VLAN ID).
If the provider manages to route, provide necessary details.
Verify provisioning using PowerShell, the Azure portal, or CLI.
5. Configure routing domains
Configure routing domains. If the provider manages Layer 3 configuration, they handle routing. Otherwise, followRouting requirementsandRouting configuration.
Enable private peering for VMs and cloud services within the Azure virtual network.
IPv4 subnets:Peering subnet for path 1 (/30)Peering subnet for path 2 (/30)
Peering subnet for path 1 (/30)
Peering subnet for path 2 (/30)
IPv6 subnets (optional):Peering subnet for path 1 (/126)Peering subnet for path 2 (/126)
Peering subnet for path 1 (/126)
Peering subnet for path 2 (/126)
VLAN ID for peering
ASN for peering
ExpressRoute ASN = 12076
MD5 Hash (Optional)
Enable this peering for Microsoft online services and Azure PaaS services. Ensure separate proxy/edge for ExpressRoute and Internet to avoid asymmetric routing.
IPv4 subnets:Peering subnet for path 1 (/30) - public IPPeering subnet for path 2 (/30) - public IP
Peering subnet for path 1 (/30) - public IP
Peering subnet for path 2 (/30) - public IP
IPv6 subnets (optional):Peering subnet for path 1 (/126) - public IPPeering subnet for path 2 (/126) - public IP
Peering subnet for path 1 (/126) - public IP
Peering subnet for path 2 (/126) - public IP
VLAN ID for peering
ASN for peering
Advertised prefixes - public IP prefixes
Customer ASN (optional if different from peering ASN)
RIR / IRR for IP and ASN validation
ExpressRoute ASN = 12076
MD5 Hash (Optional)
6. Start using the ExpressRoute circuit
Link Azure virtual networks to your ExpressRoute circuit for on-premises connectivity. SeeLink a virtual network to a circuit.
Connect to Azure and Microsoft cloud services through Microsoft peering.
ExpressRoute partner circuit provisioning states
ExpressRoute partner circuits have two states:
ServiceProviderProvisioningState: State on the provider's side (NotProvisioned,Provisioning,Provisioned). Must beProvisionedto configure peering.
Status: Microsoft's provisioning state, set to Enabled when the circuit is created.
Possible states of an ExpressRoute circuit
At creation time
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
Status                           : Enabled
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
Status                           : Enabled
During provisioning
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioning
Status                           : Enabled
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioning
Status                           : Enabled
After provisioning
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
Status                           : Enabled
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
Status                           : Enabled
During deprovisioning
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
Status                           : Enabled
ServiceProviderProvisioningState : NotProvisioned
Status                           : Enabled
Important
A circuit can't be deleted when the ServiceProviderProvisioningState is Provisioning or Provisioned. The provider must deprovision the circuit first. Microsoft continues billing until the circuit is deleted in Azure.
Routing session configuration state
The BGP provisioning state must be enabled for private or Microsoft peering. Check the BGP session state, especially for Microsoft peering. The advertised public prefixes state must beconfiguredfor routing to work.
If the advertised public prefixes state isvalidation needed, the BGP session isn't enabled.
Important
If the advertised public prefixes state ismanual validation, open a support ticket withMicrosoft supportand provide evidence of IP address ownership and associated ASN.
