The ECasv5-series and ECadsv5-series areconfidential VMsfor use in Confidential Computing.
These confidential VMs use AMD's third-Generation EPYCTM7763v processor in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 256 MB L3 cache. This processor can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. Both series offer Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). SEV-SNP provides hardware-isolated VMs that protect data from other VMs, the hypervisor, and host management code. Confidential VMs offer hardware-based VM memory encryption. These series also offer OS disk pre-encryption before VM provisioning with different key management solutions.
These VM series also offer a combination of vCPUs and memory to meet the requirements of most memory-intensive enterprise applications.
ECasv5-series
ECasv5-series VMs offer a combination of vCPU and memory for memory-intensive enterprise applications. These VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads where you don't need a local temp disk. For more information, see theFAQ for Azure VM sizes with no local temporary disk.
This series supports Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. Billing for disk storage and VMs is separate. To estimate your costs, use thePricing Calculator.
Note
There are somepricing differences based on your encryption settingsfor confidential VMs.

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toReadOnlyorReadWrite.  For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toNone.

Expected network bandwidthis the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth.Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines. To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
