APPLIES TO: Standard v2 | Premium v2
This article guides you through the process of configuringvirtual network integrationfor your Standard v2 or Premium v2 (preview) Azure API Management instance. With virtual network integration, your instance can make outbound requests to APIs that are isolated in a single connected virtual network or any peered virtual network, as long as network connectivity is properly configured.
When an API Management instance is integrated with a virtual network for outbound requests, the gateway and developer portal endpoints remain publicly accessible. The API Management instance can reach both public and network-isolated backend services.

If you want to inject a Premium v2 (preview) API Management instance into a virtual network to isolate both inbound and outbound traffic, seeInject a Premium v2 instance into a virtual network.
Important
Outbound virtual network integration described in this article is available only for API Management instances in the Standard v2 and Premium v2 tiers. For networking options in the different tiers, seeUse a virtual network with Azure API Management.
You can enable virtual network integration when you create an API Management instance in the Standard v2 or Premium v2 tier, or after the instance is created.
Currently, you can't switch between virtual network injection and virtual network integration for a Premium v2 instance.
Prerequisites
An Azure API Management instance in theStandard v2 or Premium v2pricing tier
(Optional) For testing, a sample backend API hosted within a different subnet in the virtual network. For example, seeTutorial: Establish Azure Functions private site access.
A virtual network with a subnet where your API Management backend APIs are hosted. See the following sections for requirements and recommendations for the virtual network and subnet.
Network location
The virtual network must be in the same region and Azure subscription as the API Management instance.
Dedicated subnet
The subnet used for virtual network integration can only be used by a single API Management instance. It can't be shared with another Azure resource.
Subnet size
Minimum: /27 (32 addresses)
Recommended: /24 (256 addresses) - to accommodate scaling of API Management instance
Network security group
A network security group must be associated with the subnet. Configure any network security group rules that you need for the gateway to access your API backends. To set up a network security group, seeCreate a network security group.
Subnet delegation
The subnet needs to be delegated to theMicrosoft.Web/serverFarmsservice.

Note
You might need to register theMicrosoft.Web/serverFarmsresource provider in the subscription so that you can delegate the subnet to the service.
Microsoft.Web/serverFarms
For more information about configuring subnet delegation, seeAdd or remove a subnet delegation.
Permissions
You must have at least the following role-based access control permissions on the subnet or at a higher level to configure virtual network integration:
Configure virtual network integration
This section guides you through the process to configure external virtual network integration for an existing Azure API Management instance. You can also configure virtual network integration when you create a new API Management instance.
In theAzure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.
In the left menu, underDeployment + Infrastructure, selectNetwork>Edit.
On theNetwork configurationpage, underOutbound features, selectEnablevirtual network integration.
Select the virtual network and the delegated subnet that you want to integrate.
SelectSave. The virtual network is integrated.
(Optional) Test virtual network integration
If you have an API hosted in the virtual network, you can import it to your Management instance and test the virtual network integration. For basic steps, seeImport and publish an API.
