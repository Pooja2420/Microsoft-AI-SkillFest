Suppose you are an IT administrator who is managing your organization's restricted network. You want to enable the network connection between Azure Synapse Analytics Studio and a workstation within this restricted network. This article shows you how.
Prerequisites
Azure subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree Azure accountbefore you begin.
Azure Synapse Analytics workspace: You can create one from Azure Synapse Analytics. You need the workspace name in step 4.
A restricted network: The IT admin maintains the restricted network for the organization, and has permission to configure the network policy. You need the virtual network name and its subnet in step 3.
Step 1: Add network outbound security rules to the restricted network
You'll need to add four network outbound security rules with four service tags.
AzureResourceManager
AzureFrontDoor.Frontend
AzureActiveDirectory
AzureMonitor (This type of rule is optional. Add it only when you want to share the data with Microsoft.)
The following screenshot shows details for the Azure Resource Manager outbound rule.

When you're creating the other three rules, replace the value ofDestination service tagwithAzureFrontDoor.Frontend,AzureActiveDirectory, orAzureMonitorfrom the list.
For more information, seeService tags overview.
Step 2: Create private link hubs
Next, create private link hubs from the Azure portal. To find this in the portal, search forAzure Synapse Analytics (private link hubs), and then fill in the required information to create it.

Step 3: Create a private endpoint for your Synapse Studio
To access the Azure Synapse Analytics Studio, you must create a private endpoint from the Azure portal. To find this in the portal, search forPrivate Link. In thePrivate Link Center, selectCreate private endpoint, and then fill in the required information to create it.
Note
Ensure that theRegionvalue is the same as the one where your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace is.

On theResourcetab, choose the private link hub, which you created in step 2.

On theConfigurationtab:
ForVirtual network, select the restricted virtual network name.
ForSubnet, select the subnet of the restricted virtual network.
ForIntegrate with private DNS zone, selectYes.

After the private link endpoint is created, you can access the sign-in page of the web tool for Azure Synapse Analytics Studio. However, you aren't able to access the resources inside your workspace yet. For that, you need to complete the next step.
Step 4: Create private endpoints for your workspace resource
To access the resources inside your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace resource, you need to create the following:
At least one private link endpoint with aTarget sub-resourcetype ofDev.
Two other optional private link endpoints with types ofSqlorSqlOnDemand, depending on what resources in the workspace you want to access.
Creating these is similar to how you create the endpoint in the previous step.
On theResourcetab:
ForResource type, selectMicrosoft.Synapse/workspaces.
ForResource, select the workspace name that you created previously.
ForTarget sub-resource, select the endpoint type:Sqlis for SQL query execution in SQL pool.SqlOnDemandis for SQL built-in query execution.Devis for accessing everything else inside Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces. You need to create at least one private link endpoint of this type.
Sqlis for SQL query execution in SQL pool.
SqlOnDemandis for SQL built-in query execution.
Devis for accessing everything else inside Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces. You need to create at least one private link endpoint of this type.

Step 5: Create private endpoints for workspace linked storage
To access the linked storage with the storage explorer in Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, you must create one private endpoint. The steps for this are similar to those of step 3.
On theResourcetab:
ForResource type, selectMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts.
ForResource, select the storage account name that you created previously.
ForTarget sub-resource, select the endpoint type:blobis for Azure Blob Storage.dfsis for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
blobis for Azure Blob Storage.
dfsis for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

Now, you can access the linked storage resource. Within your virtual network, in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, you can use the storage explorer to access the linked storage resource.
You can enable a managed virtual network for your workspace, as shown in this screenshot:

If you want your notebook to access the linked storage resources under a certain storage account, add managed private endpoints under your Azure Synapse Analytics Studio. The storage account name should be the one your notebook needs to access. For more information, seeCreate a managed private endpoint to your data source.
After you create this endpoint, the approval state shows a status ofPending. Request approval from the owner of this storage account, in thePrivate endpoint connectionstab of this storage account in the Azure portal. After it's approved, your notebook can access the linked storage resources under this storage account.
Now, all set. You can access your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace resource.
Step 6: Allow URL through firewall
Following URLs must be accessible from client browser after enabling Azure Synapse private link hub.
Required for auth:
login.microsoftonline.com
login.microsoftonline.com
aadcdn.msauth.net
aadcdn.msauth.net
msauth.net
msauth.net
msftauth.net
msftauth.net
graph.microsoft.com
graph.microsoft.com
login.live.com, though this may be different based on account type.
login.live.com
Required for workspace/pool management:
management.azure.com
management.azure.com
{workspaceName}.[dev|sql].azuresynapse.net
{workspaceName}.[dev|sql].azuresynapse.net
{workspaceName}-ondemand.sql.azuresynapse.net
{workspaceName}-ondemand.sql.azuresynapse.net
Required for Synapse notebook authoring:
aznb.azuresandbox.ms
aznb.azuresandbox.ms
Required for access control and identity searching:
graph.windows.net
graph.windows.net
Appendix: DNS registration for private endpoint
If the "Integrate with private DNS zone" is not enabled during the private endpoint creation as screenshot below, you must create the "Private DNS zone" for each of your private endpoints.
To find thePrivate DNS zonein the portal, search forPrivate DNS zone. In thePrivate DNS zone, fill in the required information below to create it.
ForName, input the private DNS zone dedicated name for specific private endpoint as below:privatelink.azuresynapse.netis for the private endpoint of accessing Azure Synapse Analytics Studio gateway. See this type of private endpoint creation in step 3.privatelink.sql.azuresynapse.netis for this type of private endpoint of sql query execution in SQL pool and built-in pool. See the endpoint creation in step 4.privatelink.dev.azuresynapse.netis for this type of private endpoint of accessing everything else inside Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces. See this type of private endpoint creation in step 4.privatelink.dfs.core.windows.netis for the private endpoint of accessing workspace linked Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
