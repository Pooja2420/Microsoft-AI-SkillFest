Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource
After the sign-in workflow, right-click the Azure OpenAI item in Azure Explorer and selectCreate Azure OpenAI Service.

In theCreate Azure OpenAI Servicedialog box, specify the following information and then selectOK:Name: A descriptive name for your Azure OpenAI Service resource, such asMyOpenAIResource. This name is also your custom domain name in your endpoint. Your resource name can only include alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and can't start or end with a hyphen.Region: The location of your instance. Certain models are only available in specific regions. For more information, seeAzure OpenAI Service models.Sku: Standard Azure OpenAI resources are billed based on token usage. For more information, seeAzure OpenAI Service pricing.

Before you can use chat completions, you need to deploy a model. Right-click your Azure OpenAI instance, and selectCreate New Deployment. In the pop-upCreate Azure OpenAI Deploymentdialog box, specify the following information and then selectOK:Deployment Name: Choose a name carefully. The deployment name is used in your code to call the model by using the client libraries and the REST APIs.Model: Select a model. Model availability varies by region. For a list of available models per region, see theModel summary table and region availabilitysection ofAzure OpenAI Service models.

The toolkit displays a status message when the deployment is complete and ready for use.
Interact with Azure OpenAI using prompts and settings
Right-click your Azure OpenAI resource and then selectOpen in AI Playground.
Right-click your Azure OpenAI resource and then selectOpen in AI Playground.
You can start exploring OpenAI capabilities through the Azure OpenAI Studio Chat playground in IntelliJ IDEA.

To trigger the completion, you can input some text as a prompt. The model generates the completion and attempts to match your context or pattern.
To start a chat session, follow these steps:
In the chat session pane, you can start with a simple prompt like this one: "I'm interested in buying a new Surface." After you type the prompt, selectSend. You receive a response similar to the following example:Great! Which Surface model are you interested in? There are several options available such as the Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, Surface Book, Surface Go, and Surface Studio. Each one has its own unique features and specifications, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs.

Enter a follow-up question like: "Which models support GPU?" and selectSend. You receive a response similar to the following example:Most Surface models come with an integrated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), which is sufficient for basic graphics tasks such as video playback and casual gaming. However, if you're looking for more powerful graphics performance, the Surface Book 3 and the Surface Studio 2 come with dedicated GPUs. The Surface Book 3 has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU, while the Surface Studio 2 has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 GPU, depending on the configuration.

Now that you have a basic conversation, selectView codefrom the pane, and you have a replay of the code behind the entire conversation so far. You can see the code samples based on Java SDK, curl, and JSON that correspond to your chat session and settings, as shown in the following screenshot:

Clean up resources
After you're done testing out the chat playground, if you want to clean up and remove an OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Use the following steps to clean up resources:
To delete your Azure OpenAI resources, navigate to the left-handAzure Explorersidebar and locate theAzure OpenAIitem.
