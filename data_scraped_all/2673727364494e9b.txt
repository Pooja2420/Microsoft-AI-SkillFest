To automate tasks for your Office 365 Outlook account in workflows using Azure Logic Apps, you can add operations from theOffice 365 Outlook connectorto your workflow. For example, your workflow can perform the following tasks:
Get, send, and reply to email.
Schedule meetings on your calendar.
Add and edit contacts.
This guide shows how to add an Office 365 Outlook trigger or action to your workflow in Azure Logic Apps.
Note
The Office 365 Outlook connector works only with awork or school account, for example,@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com.If you have an@outlook.comor@hotmail.comaccount, use theOutlook.com connector.
To connect to Outlook with a different user account, such as a service account, seeConnect using other accounts.

Connect using other accounts
If you try connecting to Outlook by using a different account than the one currently signed in to Azure, you might getsingle sign-on (SSO)errors. This problem happens when you sign in to the Azure portal with one account, but use a different account to create the connection. The designer expects that you use the account that's signed in to the Azure portal. To resolve this problem, you have these options:
Set up the other account with theContributorrole in your logic app's resource group.In the Azure portal, open your logic app's resource group.On the resource group menu, selectAccess control (IAM).Assign theContributorrole to the other account.For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.After you set up this role, sign in to the Azure portal with the account that now has Contributor permissions. You can now use this account to create the connection to Outlook.
Set up the other account with theContributorrole in your logic app's resource group.
In the Azure portal, open your logic app's resource group.
In the Azure portal, open your logic app's resource group.
On the resource group menu, selectAccess control (IAM).
On the resource group menu, selectAccess control (IAM).
Assign theContributorrole to the other account.For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
Assign theContributorrole to the other account.
For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
After you set up this role, sign in to the Azure portal with the account that now has Contributor permissions. You can now use this account to create the connection to Outlook.
After you set up this role, sign in to the Azure portal with the account that now has Contributor permissions. You can now use this account to create the connection to Outlook.
Set up the other account so that your work or school account has "send as" permissions.If you have admin permissions, on the service account's mailbox, set up your work or school account with eitherSend asorSend on behalf ofpermissions. For more information, seeGive mailbox permissions to another user - Admin Help. You can then create the connection by using your work or school account. Now, in triggers or actions where you can specify the sender, you can use the service account's email address.For example, theSend an emailaction has an optional parameter,From (Send as), which you can add to the action and use your service account's email address as the sender. To add this parameter, follow these steps:In theSend an emailaction, open theAdd a parameterlist, and select theFrom (Send as)parameter.After the parameter appears on the action, enter the service account's email address.
