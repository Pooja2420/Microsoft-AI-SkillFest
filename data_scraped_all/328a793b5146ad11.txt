This article describes the details of operating system (OS) upgrades on HANA Large Instances (HLI), otherwise known as BareMetal Infrastructure.
Note
This article contains references to terms that Microsoft no longer uses. When the terms are removed from the software, we'll remove them from this article.
Note
Upgrading the OS is your responsibility. Microsoft operations support can guide you in key areas of the upgrade, but consult your operating system vendor as well when planning an upgrade.
During HLI provisioning, the Microsoft operations team installs the operating system.
You're required to maintain the operating system. For example, you need to do the patching, tuning, upgrading, and so on, on the HLI. Before you make major changes to the operating system, for example, upgrade SP1 to SP2, contact the Microsoft Operations team by opening a support ticket. They will consult with you. We recommend opening this ticket at least one week before the upgrade.
Include in your ticket:
Your HLI subscription ID.
Your server name.
The patch level you're planning to apply.
The date you're planning this change.
For the support matrix of the different SAP HANA versions with the different Linux versions, seeSAP Note #2235581.
Known issues
There are a couple of known issues with the upgrade:
On SKU Type II class SKU, the software foundation software (SFS) is removed during the OS upgrade. You'll need to reinstall the compatible SFS after the OS upgrade is complete.
Ethernet card drivers (ENIC and FNIC) are rolled back to an older version. You'll need to reinstall the compatible version of the drivers after the upgrade.
SAP HANA Large Instance (Type I) recommended configuration
The OS configuration can drift from the recommended settings over time. This drift can occur because of patching, system upgrades, and other changes you may make. Microsoft identifies updates needed to ensure HANA Large Instances are optimally configured for the best performance and resiliency. The following instructions outline recommendations that address network performance, system stability, and optimal HANA performance.
Compatible eNIC/fNIC driver versions
To have proper network performance and system stability, ensure the appropriate OS-specific version of eNIC and fNIC drivers are installed per the following compatibility table (This table has the latest compatible driver version). Servers are delivered to customers with compatible versions. However, drivers can get rolled back to default versions during OS/kernel patching. Ensure the appropriate driver version is running post OS/kernel patching operations.
Commands for driver upgrade and to clean old rpm packages
rpm -qa | grep enic/fnic
rpm -qa | grep enic/fnic
rpm -e <old-rpm-package>
rpm -e <old-rpm-package>
rpm -ivh <enic/fnic.rpm>
rpm -ivh <enic/fnic.rpm>
modinfo enic
modinfo fnic
modinfo enic
modinfo fnic
Upgrade OS version
Remove old rpm packages
Install compatible eNIC/fNIC drivers as per installed OS version
Reboot system
After reboot, check the eNIC/fNIC version
SuSE HLIs GRUB update failure
SAP on Azure HANA Large Instances (Type I) can be in a non-bootable state after upgrade. The following procedure fixes this issue.
Execute themultipath -llcommand.
multipath -ll
Get the logical unit number (LUN) ID or use the command:fdisk -l | grep mapper
fdisk -l | grep mapper
Update the/etc/default/grub_installdevicefile with line/dev/mapper/<LUN ID>. Example: /dev/mapper/3600a09803830372f483f495242534a56
/etc/default/grub_installdevice
/dev/mapper/<LUN ID>
Note
The LUN ID varies from server to server.
Disable Error Detection And Correction
Error Detection And Correction (EDAC) modules help detect and correct memory errors. However, the underlying HLI Type I hardware already detects and corrects memory errors. Enabling the same feature at the hardware and OS levels can cause conflicts and lead to unplanned shutdowns of the server. We recommend disabling the EDAC modules from the OS.
Check whether the EDAC modules are enabled. If an output is returned from the following command, the modules are enabled.
lsmod | grep -i edac
lsmod | grep -i edac
Disable the modules by appending the following lines to the file/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
blacklist sb_edac
blacklist edac_core
blacklist sb_edac
blacklist edac_core
A reboot is required for the changes to take place. After reboot, execute thelsmodcommand again and verify the modules aren't enabled.
lsmod
Kernel parameters
Make sure the correct settings fortransparent_hugepage,numa_balancing,processor.max_cstate,ignore_ce, andintel_idle.max_cstateare applied.
transparent_hugepage
numa_balancing
processor.max_cstate
ignore_ce
intel_idle.max_cstate
intel_idle.max_cstate=1
processor.max_cstate=1
transparent_hugepage=never
numa_balancing=disable
mce=ignore_ce
Add these parameters to theGRB_CMDLINE_LINUXline in the file/etc/default/grub:
GRB_CMDLINE_LINUX
/etc/default/grub
intel_idle.max_cstate=1 processor.max_cstate=1 transparent_hugepage=never numa_balancing=disable mce=ignore_ce
intel_idle.max_cstate=1 processor.max_cstate=1 transparent_hugepage=never numa_balancing=disable mce=ignore_ce
Create a new grub file.
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Reboot your system.
