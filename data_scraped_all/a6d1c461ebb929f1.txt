If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, seeUse and manage extensions with the Azure CLI.Runaz versionto find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, runaz upgrade.

Azure portal
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the Azure portal home page, selectCreate a resource.
UnderCategories, selectContainers>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
On theBasicstab, configure the following settings:UnderProject details:Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.Resource group: SelectCreate new, enter a resource group name, such astest-rg, and then selectOk.UnderCluster details:Kubernetes cluster name: Enter a cluster name, such asaks-cluster.Region: SelectEast US 2.
UnderProject details:Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.Resource group: SelectCreate new, enter a resource group name, such astest-rg, and then selectOk.
Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
Resource group: SelectCreate new, enter a resource group name, such astest-rg, and then selectOk.
UnderCluster details:Kubernetes cluster name: Enter a cluster name, such asaks-cluster.Region: SelectEast US 2.
Kubernetes cluster name: Enter a cluster name, such asaks-cluster.
Region: SelectEast US 2.
SelectNext>Nextto get to theNetworkingtab.
ForContainer networking, selectAzure CNI Node Subnet.
SelectReview + create>Create.
When you create an AKS cluster with Azure PowerShell, you can also configure Azure CNI networking.
UseNew-AzAksClusterto create an AKS cluster with default settings and Azure CNI networking:
## Create a resource group for the AKS cluster. ##
$rg = @{
    Name = "test-rg"
    Location = "eastus2"
}
New-AzResourceGroup @rg

$net = @{
      NetworkPlugin = "azure"
      ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
      Name = "aks-cluster"
}
New-AzAksCluster @net
## Create a resource group for the AKS cluster. ##
$rg = @{
    Name = "test-rg"
    Location = "eastus2"
}
New-AzResourceGroup @rg

$net = @{
      NetworkPlugin = "azure"
      ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
      Name = "aks-cluster"
}
New-AzAksCluster @net
When you create an AKS cluster with the Azure CLI, you can also configure Azure CNI networking.
Useaz aks createwith the--network-plugin azureargument to create a cluster withAzure CNI Node Subnet:
az aks create
--network-plugin azure
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2

az aks create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name aks-cluster \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --generate-ssh-keys
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2

az aks create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name aks-cluster \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --generate-ssh-keys
