AKS provides multiple autoupgrade channels dedicated to timely node-level OS security updates. This channel is different from cluster-level Kubernetes version upgrades and supersedes it.
Interactions between node OS autoupgrade and cluster autoupgrade
Node-level OS security updates are released at a faster rate than Kubernetes patch or minor version updates. The node OS autoupgrade channel grants you flexibility and enables a customized strategy for node-level OS security updates. Then, you can choose a separate plan for cluster-level Kubernetes versionautoupgrades.
It's best to use both cluster-levelautoupgradesand the node OS autoupgrade channel together. Scheduling can be fine-tuned by applying two separate sets ofmaintenance windows-aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedulefor the clusterautoupgradechannel andaksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedulefor the node OS autoupgrade channel.

Channels for node OS image upgrades
The selected channel determines the timing of upgrades. When making changes to node OS auto-upgrade channels, allow up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect.
Note
Once you change from one channel to another channel,a reimage is triggered leading to rolling nodes.
Node OS image auto-upgrade won't affect the cluster's Kubernetes version. Starting with API version 2023-06-01, the default for any new cluster created isNodeImage.

The following upgrade channels are available. You're allowed to choose one of these options:

Set the node OS autoupgrade channel on a new cluster using theaz aks createcommand with the--node-os-upgrade-channelparameter. The following example sets the node OS autoupgrade channel toSecurityPatch.az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --node-os-upgrade-channel SecurityPatch \
    --generate-ssh-keys

While Windows security updates are released on a monthly basis, using theUnmanagedchannel will not automatically apply these updates to Windows nodes. If you choose theUnmanagedchannel, you need to manage the reboot process for Windows nodes.

Node channel known limitations
Currently, when you set thecluster autoupgrade channeltonode-image, it also automatically sets the node OS autoupgrade channel toNodeImage. You can't change node OS autoupgrade channel value if your cluster autoupgrade channel isnode-image. In order to set the node OS autoupgrade channel value, check thecluster autoupgrade channelvalue isn'tnode-image.

Node OS planned maintenance windows
Planned maintenance for the node OS autoupgrade starts at your specified maintenance window.
Note
To ensure proper functionality, use a maintenance window of four hours or more.
For more information on Planned Maintenance, seeUse Planned Maintenance to schedule maintenance windows for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
Node OS autoupgrades FAQ
How can I check the current nodeOsUpgradeChannel value on a cluster?
Run theaz aks showcommand and check the "autoUpgradeProfile" to determine what value thenodeOsUpgradeChannelis set to:
az aks show
nodeOsUpgradeChannel
az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query "autoUpgradeProfile"
az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query "autoUpgradeProfile"
How can I monitor the status of node OS autoupgrades?
To view the status of your node OS auto upgrades, look upactivity logson your cluster. You can also look up specific upgrade-related events as mentioned inUpgrade an AKS cluster. AKS also emits upgrade-related Event Grid events. To learn more, seeAKS as an Event Grid source.
Can I change the node OS autoupgrade channel value if my cluster autoupgrade channel is set tonode-image?
node-image
No. Currently, when you set thecluster autoupgrade channeltonode-image, it also automatically sets the node OS autoupgrade channel toNodeImage. You can't change the node OS autoupgrade channel value if your cluster autoupgrade channel isnode-image. In order to be able to change the node OS autoupgrade channel values, make sure thecluster autoupgrade channelisn'tnode-image.

Why isSecurityPatchrecommended overUnmanagedchannel?
SecurityPatch
Unmanaged
On theUnmanagedchannel, AKS has no control over how and when the security updates are delivered. WithSecurityPatch, the security updates are fully tested and follow safe deployment practices.SecurityPatchalso honors maintenance windows. For more details, seeIncreased security and resiliency of Canonical workloads on Azure.

SecurityPatch
DoesSecurityPatchalways lead to a reimage of my nodes?
SecurityPatch
AKS limits reimages to only when absolutely necessary, such as certain kernel packages that may require a reimage to get fully applied.SecurityPatchis designed to minimize disruptions as much as possible. If AKS decides reimaging nodes isn't necessary, it will patch nodes live without draining pods and no VHD update is performed in such cases.
SecurityPatch
Why doesSecurityPatchchannel requires to reachsnapshot.ubuntu.comendpoint?
SecurityPatch
snapshot.ubuntu.com
With theSecurityPatchchannel, the Linux cluster nodes have to download the required security patches and updates from ubuntu snapshot service described inubuntu-snapshots-on-azure-ensuring-predictability-and-consistency-in-cloud-deployments.
SecurityPatch
How do I know if aSecurityPatchorNodeImageupgrade is applied on my node?
SecurityPatch
NodeImage
Run the following command to obtain node labels:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
Among the returned labels, you should see a line similar to the following output:
kubernetes.azure.com/node-image-version=AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202410.27.0-2024.12.01
kubernetes.azure.com/node-image-version=AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202410.27.0-2024.12.01
Here, the base node image version isAKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202410.27.0. If applicable, the security patch version typically follows. In the above example, it's2024.12.01.
AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202410.27.0
2024.12.01
The same details also be looked up in the Azure portal under the node label view:
