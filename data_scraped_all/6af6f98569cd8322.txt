This article contains all the monitoring reference information for this service.
SeeMonitor Azure Service Busfor details on the data you can collect for Service Bus and how to use it.
Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list ofall platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor.
For information on metric retention, seeAzure Monitor Metrics overview.
Supported metrics for Microsoft.ServiceBus/Namespaces
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.ServiceBus/Namespaces resource type.
All columns might not be present in every table.
Some columns might be beyond the viewing area of the page. SelectExpand tableto view all available columns.
Table headings
Category- The metrics group or classification.
Metric- The metric display name as it appears in the Azure portal.
Name in REST API- The metric name as referred to in theREST API.
Unit- Unit of measure.
Aggregation- The defaultaggregationtype. Valid values: Average (Avg), Minimum (Min), Maximum (Max), Total (Sum), Count.
Dimensions-Dimensionsavailable for the metric.
Time Grains-Intervalsat which the metric is sampled. For example,PT1Mindicates that the metric is sampled every minute,PT30Mevery 30 minutes,PT1Hevery hour, and so on.
PT1M
PT30M
PT1H
DS Export- Whether the metric is exportable to Azure Monitor Logs via diagnostic settings. For information on exporting metrics, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.

The following sections provide more detailed descriptions for metrics presented in the previous section.
Request metrics
Request metricscount the number of data and management operations requests.

MessagingErrorSubCode dimension has the following possible values:
CPU:CPU throttling
Storage:It indicates throttle because of pending checkpoint operations
Namespace:Namespace operations throttling.
Unknown:Other resource throttling.

The following two types of errors are classified asuser errors:
Client-side errors (In HTTP that would be 400 errors).
Errors that occur while processing messages, such asMessageLockLostException.
Message metrics
The following metrics aremessage metrics.
Important
Values for messages, active, dead-lettered, scheduled, completed, and abandoned messages are point-in-time values. Incoming messages that were consumed immediately after that point-in-time might not be reflected in these metrics.
Note
When a client tries to get the info about a queue or topic, the Service Bus service returns some static information such as name, last updated time, created time, and requires session or not. Some dynamic information like message counts. If the request gets throttled, the service returns the static information and empty dynamic information. That's why message counts are shown as 0 when the namespace is being throttled. This behavior is by design.
Connection metrics
The following metrics areconnection metrics.
Resource usage metrics
The followingresource metricsare available only with thepremiumtier.
The important metrics to monitor for any outages for a premium tier namespace are:CPU usage per namespaceandmemory size per namespace.Set up alertsfor these metrics using Azure Monitor.
The other metric you could monitor is:throttled requests. It shouldn't be an issue though as long as the namespace stays within its memory, CPU, and brokered connections limits. For more information, seeThrottling in Azure Service Bus Premium tier
Error metrics
The following metrics areerror metrics.
Geo-Replication metrics
The following metrics aregeo-replicationmetrics:
Metric dimensions
For information about what metric dimensions are, seeMulti-dimensional metrics.
This service has the following dimensions associated with its metrics.
EntityNameService Bus supports messaging entities under the namespace. With the Incoming Requests metric, the Entity Name dimension has a value of-NamespaceOnlyMetric-in addition to all your queues and topics. This value represents the request, which was made at the namespace level. Examples include a  request to list all queues/topics under the namespace or requests to entities that failed authentication or authorization.

Note
Azure Monitor doesn't include dimensions in the exported metrics data sent to a destination like Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Monitor Logs.

Events and operations captured in operational logs
Operational logs capture all management operations that are performed on the Azure Service Bus namespace. Data operations aren't captured, because of the high volume of data operations that are conducted on Azure Service Bus.
Note
To help you better track data operations, we recommend using client-side tracing.
The following management operations are captured in operational logs:
Note
Currently,Readoperations aren't tracked in the operational logs.

Azure Monitor Logs tables
This section lists the Azure Monitor Logs tables relevant to this service, which are available for query by Log Analytics using Kusto queries. The tables contain resource log data and possibly more depending on what is collected and routed to them.
On 30 September 2026, we'll retire support of the SBMP protocol for Azure Service Bus, so you'll no longer be able to use this protocol after 30 September 2026. Migrate to the latest Azure Service Bus SDK libraries using the AMQP protocol, which offer critical security updates and improved capabilities, before that date.
For more information, see thesupport retirement announcement.
Azure Service Bus uses Kusto tables from Azure Monitor Logs. You can query these tables with Log Analytics.
