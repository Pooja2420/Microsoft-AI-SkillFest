Allow access to Azure Service Bus namespace from specific IP addresses or ranges

By default, Service Bus namespaces are accessible from the internet as long as the request contains valid authentication and authorization. With IP firewall, inbound traffic can be restricted to a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges (inCIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)notation).
This feature is helpful in scenarios in which Azure Service Bus should be only accessible from certain well-known sites. Firewall rules enable you to configure rules to accept traffic originating from specific IPv4 addresses. For example, if you use Service Bus withAzure Express Route, you can create afirewall ruleto allow traffic from only your on-premises infrastructure IP addresses or addresses of a corporate NAT gateway.
IP firewall rules
The IP firewall rules are applied at the Service Bus namespace level. Therefore, the rules apply to all connections from clients using anysupported protocol(AMQP (5671) and HTTPS (443)). Any connection attempt from an IP address that doesn't match an allowed IP rule on the Service Bus namespace is rejected as unauthorized. The response doesn't mention the IP rule. IP filter rules are applied in order, and the first rule that matches the IP address determines the accept or reject action.
Important points
Virtual Networks are supported only in thepremiumtier of Service Bus. If upgrading to thepremiumtier isn't an option, it's possible to use IP firewall rules using theAzure portal,Azure Resource Manager templates,Azure CLI,PowerShellorREST API. We recommend that you keep the Shared Access Signature (SAS) token secure and share it with only authorized users. For information about SAS authentication, seeAuthentication and authorization.

Specifyat least one IP firewall rule or virtual network rulefor the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network. If there are no IP and virtual network rules, the namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key).

Implementing firewall rules can prevent other Azure services from interacting with Service Bus. As an exception, you can allow access to Service Bus resources from certaintrusted serviceseven when IP filtering is enabled.

Use Azure portal
When creating a namespace, you can either allow public only (from all networks) or private only (only via private endpoints) access to the namespace. Once the namespace is created, you can allow access from specific IP addresses or from specific virtual networks (using network service endpoints).
Configure public access when creating a namespace
To enable public access, selectPublic accesson theNetworkingpage of the namespace creation wizard.

After you create the namespace, selectNetworkingon the left menu of theService Bus Namespacepage. You see thatAll Networksoption is selected. You can selectSelected Networksoption and allow access from specific IP addresses or specific virtual networks. The next section provides you details on configuring IP firewall to specify the IP addresses from which the access is allowed.
Configure IP firewall for an existing namespace
This section shows you how to use the Azure portal to create IP firewall rules for a Service Bus namespace.
Navigate to yourService Bus namespacein theAzure portal.
Navigate to yourService Bus namespacein theAzure portal.
On the left menu, selectNetworkingoption underSettings.NoteYou see theNetworkingtab only forpremiumnamespaces.
On the left menu, selectNetworkingoption underSettings.

On theNetworkingpage, forPublic network access, you can set one of the three following options. ChooseSelected networksoption to allow access from only specified IP addresses.Disabled. This option disables any public access to the namespace. The namespace is accessible only throughprivate endpoints.Choose whether you want to allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass the firewall. For the list of trusted Microsoft services for Azure Service Bus, see theTrusted Microsoft servicessection.Selected networks.

ChooseDisabledif you want to restrict all traffic to this namespace overprivate endpointsonly.All networks(default). This option enables public access from all networks using an access key. If you select theAll networksoption, Service Bus accepts connections from any IP address (using the access key). This setting is equivalent to a rule that accepts the 0.0.0.0/0 IP address range.

Important
If there are no IP and virtual network rules, all the traffic flows into the namespace even if you set thedefaultActiontodeny. The namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key). Specify at least one IP rule or virtual network rule for the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network.

The default value of thedefaultActionproperty wasDenyfor API version2021-01-01-preview and earlier. However, the deny rule isn't enforced unless you set IP filters or virtual network rules. That is, if you didn't have any IP filters or virtual network rules, Service Bus treats it asAllow.
defaultAction
Deny
Allow
From API version2021-06-01-preview onwards, the default value of thedefaultActionproperty isAllow, to accurately reflect the service-side enforcement. If the default action is set toDeny, IP filters and virtual network rules are enforced. If the default action is set toAllow, IP filters and virtual network rules aren't enforced. The service remembers the rules when you turn them off and then back on again.

The API version2021-06-01-preview onwardsalso introduces a new property namedpublicNetworkAccess. If you set it toDisabled, operations are restricted to private links only. If you set it toEnabled, operations are allowed over the public internet.

Azure portal
Azure portal always uses the latest API version to get and set properties. If you previously configured your namespace using2021-01-01-preview and earlierwithdefaultActionset toDeny, and specified zero IP filters and virtual network rules, the portal would have previously checkedSelected Networkson theNetworkingpage of your namespace. Now, it checks theAll networksoption.
