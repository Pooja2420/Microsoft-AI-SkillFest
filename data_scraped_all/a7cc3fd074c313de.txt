Applies to: â Azure Cache for Redis
In this article
In this article, you learn how to create a virtual network and an Azure Cache for Redis instance with a private endpoint using the Azure portal. You also learn how to add a private endpoint to an existing Azure Cache for Redis instance.
Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to Azure Cache for Redis powered by Azure Private Link.
You can restrict public access to the private endpoint of your cache by disabling thePublicNetworkAccessflag.
PublicNetworkAccess
Important
There is apublicNetworkAccessflag which isDisabledby default.
You can set the value toDisabledorEnabled. When set to enabled, this flag allows both public and private endpoint access to the cache. When set toDisabled, it allows only private endpoint access. Neither the Enterprise nor Enterprise Flash tier supports thepublicNetworkAccessflag. For more information on how to change the value, see theFAQ.

Important
Private endpoint is supported on cache tiers Basic, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise. We recommend using private endpoint instead of VNets. Private endpoints are easy to set up or remove, are supported on all tiers, and can connect your cache to multiple different VNets at once.
When using the Basic tier, you might experience data loss when you delete and recreate a private endpoint.
Scope of availability
Prerequisites
Azure subscription -create one for free
Important
Currently, theportal-based redis consoleis not supported with private link.
Important
When using private link, you cannot export or import data to a to a storage account that has firewall enabled unless you're using a Premium tier cache withmanaged identity to authenticate to the storage account.
For more information, seeWhat if I have firewall enabled on my storage account?

How do I connect to my cache with private endpoint?
ForBasic, Standard, and Premium tiercaches, your application should connect to<cachename>.redis.cache.windows.neton port6380. A private DNS zone, named*.privatelink.redis.cache.windows.net, is automatically created in your subscription. The private DNS zone is vital for establishing the TLS connection with the private endpoint.  We recommend avoiding the use of<cachename>.privatelink.redis.cache.windows.netin configuration or connection string.
<cachename>.redis.cache.windows.net
6380
*.privatelink.redis.cache.windows.net
<cachename>.privatelink.redis.cache.windows.net
ForEnterprise and Enterprise Flashtier caches, your application should connect to<cachename>.<region>.redisenterprise.cache.azure.neton port10000. If you're using OSS clustering, then your client library also creates connections to your Redis Enterprise instance on ports 8500 - 8599 as your application needs to connect to each shard individually in OSS clustering configuration.
<cachename>.<region>.redisenterprise.cache.azure.net
10000

Private links can't be added to caches that are already usingpassive geo-replicationin the Premium tier. To add a private link to a geo-replicated cache: 1. Unlink the geo-replication. 2. Add a Private Link. 3. Last, relink the geo-replication. (Enterprise tier caches usingactive geo-replicationdon't have this restriction.)

Add a Private Link. 3. Last, relink the geo-replication. (Enterprise tier caches usingactive geo-replicationdon't have this restriction.)
How do I verify if my private endpoint is configured correctly?
Go toOverviewin the Resource menu on the portal. You see theHost namefor your cache in the working pane. Run a command likenslookup <hostname>from within the VNet that is linked to the private endpoint to verify that the command resolves to the private IP address for the cache.
nslookup <hostname>

How can I change my private endpoint to be disabled or enabled from public network access?
There's apublicNetworkAccessflag that isDisabledby default.
When set toEnabled, this flag is allows both public and private endpoint access to the cache. When set toDisabled, it allows only private endpoint access. You can set the value toDisabledorEnabledin the Azure portal or with a RESTful API PATCH request.

How can I migrate my VNet injected cache to a Private Link cache?
Refer to ourmigration guidefor different approaches on how to migrate your VNet injected caches to Private Link caches.
How can I have multiple endpoints in different virtual networks?
To have multiple private endpoints in different virtual networks, the private DNS zone must be manually configured to the multiple virtual networksbeforecreating the private endpoint. For more information, seeAzure Private Endpoint DNS configuration.
What happens if I delete all the private endpoints on my cache?
Once you delete the private endpoints on your cache, your cache instance can become unreachable until: you explicitly enable public network access, or you add another private endpoint. You can change thepublicNetworkAccessflag on either the Azure portal or through a RESTful API PATCH request. For more information on how to change the value, see theFAQ
publicNetworkAccess
Are network security groups (NSG) enabled for private endpoints?
No, they're disabled for private endpoints. While subnets containing the private endpoint can have NSG associated with it, the rules aren't effective on traffic processed by the private endpoint. You must havenetwork policies enforcement disabledto deploy private endpoints in a subnet. NSG is still enforced on other workloads hosted on the same subnet. Routes on any client subnet use an /32 prefix, changing the default routing behavior requires a similar UDR.
Control the traffic by using NSG rules for outbound traffic on source clients. Deploy individual routes with /32 prefix to override private endpoint routes. NSG Flow logs and monitoring information for outbound connections are still supported and can be used.
My private endpoint instance isn't in my VNet, so how is it associated with my VNet?
It's only linked to your VNet. Because it's not in your VNet, NSG rules don't need to be modified for dependent endpoints.
