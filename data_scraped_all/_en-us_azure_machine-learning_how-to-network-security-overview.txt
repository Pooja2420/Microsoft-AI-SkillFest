Tip
You can use Azure Machine Learningmanaged virtual networksinstead of the steps in this article. With a managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning handles the job of network isolation for your workspace and managed computes. You can also add private endpoints for resources needed by the workspace, such as Azure Storage Account. For more information, seeWorkspace managed network isolation.
Learn how to secure Azure Machine Learning workspace resources and compute environments using Azure Virtual Networks (VNets). This article uses an example scenario to show you how to configure a complete virtual network.

Prerequisites
This article assumes that you have familiarity with the following articles:
Azure Virtual Networks
IP networking
Azure Machine Learning workspace with private endpoint
Network Security Groups (NSG)
Network firewalls
Example scenario
In this section, you learn how a common network scenario is set up to secure Azure Machine Learning communication with private IP addresses.
The following table compares how services access different parts of an Azure Machine Learning network with and without a VNet:
Workspace- Create a private endpoint for your workspace. The private endpoint connects the workspace to the vnet through several private IP addresses.Public access- You can optionally enable public access for a secured workspace.
Public access- You can optionally enable public access for a secured workspace.
Associated resource- Use service endpoints or private endpoints to connect to workspace resources like Azure storage, Azure Key Vault. For Azure Container Services, use a private endpoint.Service endpointsprovide the identity of your virtual network to the Azure service. Once you enable service endpoints in your virtual network, you can add a virtual network rule to secure the Azure service resources to your virtual network. Service endpoints use public IP addresses.Private endpointsare network interfaces that securely connect you to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet.

Secure thetraining environment.
Secure theinferencing environment.
Optionally:enable studio functionality.
Configurefirewall settings.
ConfigureDNS name resolution.
Public workspace and secured resources
Important
While this is a supported configuration for Azure Machine Learning, Microsoft doesn't recommend it. The data in the Azure Storage Account behind the virtual network can be exposed on the public workspace. You should verify this configuration with your security team before using it in production.
If you want to access the workspace over the public internet while keeping all the associated resources secured in a virtual network, use the following steps:
Create anAzure Virtual Network. This network secures the resources used by the workspace.

Limitations
Securing your workspace and associated resources within a virtual network have the following limitations:
The workspace and default storage account must be in the same VNet. However, subnets within the same VNet are allowed. For example, the workspace in one subnet and storage in another.Werecommendthat the Azure Key Vault and Azure Container Registry for the workspace are also in the same VNet. However both of these resources can also be in apeeredVNet.

Secure the training environment
In this section, you learn how to secure the training environment in Azure Machine Learning. You also learn how Azure Machine Learning completes a training job to understand how the network configurations work together.
To secure the training environment, use the following steps:
Create an Azure Machine Learningcompute instance and computer cluster in the virtual network. Training jobs run on these computes.
Create an Azure Machine Learningcompute instance and computer cluster in the virtual network. Training jobs run on these computes.
If your compute cluster or compute instance uses a public IP address, you mustAllow inbound communicationso that management services can submit jobs to your compute resources.TipCompute cluster and compute instance can be created with or without a public IP address. If created with a public IP address, you get a load balancer with a public IP to accept the inbound access from Azure batch service and Azure Machine Learning service. You need to configure User Defined Routing (UDR) if you use a firewall. If created without a public IP, you get a private link service to accept the inbound access from Azure batch service and Azure Machine Learning service without a public IP.

Example training job submission
In this section, you learn how Azure Machine Learning securely communicates between services to submit a training job. This example shows you how all your configurations work together to secure communication.
The client uploads training scripts and training data to storage accounts that are secured with a service or private endpoint.

Limitations
Azure Compute Instance and Azure Compute Clusters must be in the same VNet, region, and subscription as the workspace. If the associated resources are in a different region than the workspace, you may experience additional latency.
Secure the inferencing environment
You can enable network isolation for managed online endpoints to secure the following network traffic:
Inbound scoring requests.
Outbound communication with the workspace, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Blob Storage.
For more information, seeEnable network isolation for managed online endpoints.
In this section, you learn the options available for securing an inferencing environment when using the Azure CLI extension for ML v1 or the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v1. When doing a v1 deployment, we recommend that you use Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) clusters for high-scale, production deployments.
You have two options for AKS clusters in a virtual network:
Deploy or attach a default AKS cluster to your VNet.
Attach a private AKS cluster to your VNet.
Default AKS clustershave a control plane with public IP addresses. You can add a default AKS cluster to your VNet during the deployment or attach a cluster after creation.
Private AKS clustershave a control plane, which can only be accessed through private IPs. Private AKS clusters must be attached after the cluster is created.
For detailed instructions on how to add default and private clusters, seeSecure an inferencing environment.
Regardless default AKS cluster or private AKS cluster used, if your AKS cluster is behind of VNET, your workspace and its associate resources (storage, key vault, and ACR) must have private endpoints or service endpoints in the same VNET as the AKS cluster.
The following network diagram shows a secured Azure Machine Learning workspace with a private AKS cluster attached to the virtual network.

Optional: Enable public access
You can secure the workspace behind a VNet using a private endpoint and still allow access over the public internet. The initial configuration is the same assecuring the workspace and associated resources.
After securing the workspace with a private endpoint, use the following steps to enable clients to develop remotely using either the SDK or Azure Machine Learning studio:
Enable public accessto the workspace.
Configure the Azure Storage firewallto allow communication with the IP address of clients that connect over the public internet.
Enable public accessto the workspace.
Configure the Azure Storage firewallto allow communication with the IP address of clients that connect over the public internet.
Optional: enable studio functionality
If your storage is in a VNet, you must use extra configuration steps to enable full functionality in studio. By default, the following features are disabled:
Preview data in the studio.
Visualize data in the designer.
Deploy a model in the designer.
Submit an AutoML experiment.
Start a labeling project.
To enable full studio functionality, seeUse Azure Machine Learning studio in a virtual network.
Limitations
ML-assisted data labelingdoesn't support a default storage account behind a virtual network. Instead, use a storage account other than the default for ML assisted data labeling.
Tip
As long as it is not the default storage account, the account used by data labeling can be secured behind the virtual network.
Configure firewall settings
Configure your firewall to control traffic between your Azure Machine Learning workspace resources and the public internet. While we recommend Azure Firewall, you can use other firewall products.
For more information on firewall settings, seeUse workspace behind a Firewall.
Custom DNS
If you need to use a custom DNS solution for your virtual network, you must add host records for your workspace.
For more information on the required domain names and IP addresses, seehow to use a workspace with a custom DNS server.
Microsoft Sentinel
Microsoft Sentinel is a security solution that can integrate with Azure Machine Learning. For example, using Jupyter notebooks provided through Azure Machine Learning. For more information, seeUse Jupyter notebooks to hunt for security threats.
Public access
Microsoft Sentinel can automatically create a workspace for you if you're OK with a public endpoint. In this configuration, the security operations center (SOC) analysts and system administrators connect to notebooks in your workspace through Sentinel.
For information on this process, seeCreate an Azure Machine Learning workspace from Microsoft Sentinel

Private endpoint
If you want to secure your workspace and associated resources in a VNet, you must create the Azure Machine Learning workspace first. You must also create a virtual machine 'jump box' in the same VNet as your workspace, and enable Azure Bastion connectivity to it. Similar to the public configuration, SOC analysts and administrators can connect using Microsoft Sentinel, but some operations must be performed using Azure Bastion to connect to the VM.
For more information on this configuration, seeCreate an Azure Machine Learning workspace from Microsoft Sentinel
