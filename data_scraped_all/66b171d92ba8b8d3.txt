When you host your apps or microservices in Azure Container Apps, you might not always want to publish them directly to the internet. Instead, you might want to expose them through a reverse proxy.
A reverse proxy is a service that sits in front of one or more services, intercepting and directing incoming traffic to the appropriate destination.
Reverse proxies allow you to place services in front of your apps that supports cross-cutting functionality including:
Routing
Caching
Rate limiting
Load balancing
Security layers
Request filtering
This article demonstrates how to protect your container apps using aWeb Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gatewaywith an internal Container Apps environment.
For more information on networking concepts in Container Apps, seeNetworking Environment in Azure Container Apps.
Prerequisites
Internal environment with custom VNet: Have a container app that is on an internal environment and integrated with a custom virtual network. For more information on how to create a custom virtual network integrated app, seeprovide a virtual network to an Azure Container Apps environment.

Security certificates: If you must use TLS/SSL encryption to the application gateway, a valid public certificate that's used to bind to your application gateway is required.
