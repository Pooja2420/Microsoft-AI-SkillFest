A public IP address prefix is a reserved range ofpublic IP addressesin Azure. Public IP prefixes are assigned from a pool of addresses in each Azure region.
You create a public IP address prefix in an Azure region and subscription by specifying a name and prefix size. The prefix size is the number of addresses available for use. Public IP address prefixes consist of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. In regions with Availability Zones, Public IP address prefixes can be created as zone-redundant or associated with a specific availability zone. After the public IP prefix is created, you can create public IP addresses.
Benefits
Creation of static public IP address resources from a known range. Addresses that you create using from the prefix can be assigned to any Azure resource that you can assign a standard SKU public IP address.

When you delete the individual public IPs, they'rereturnedto your reserved range for later reuse. The IP addresses in your public IP address prefix are reserved for your use until you delete your prefix.

You can see which IP addresses that are given and available within the prefix range.

Prefix sizes
The following public IP prefix sizes are available:
/28 (IPv4) or /124 (IPv6) = 16 addresses
/28 (IPv4) or /124 (IPv6) = 16 addresses
/29 (IPv4) or /125 (IPv6) = 8 addresses
/29 (IPv4) or /125 (IPv6) = 8 addresses
/30 (IPv4) or /126 (IPv6) = 4 addresses
/30 (IPv4) or /126 (IPv6) = 4 addresses
/31 (IPv4) or /127 (IPv6) = 2 addresses
/31 (IPv4) or /127 (IPv6) = 2 addresses
Prefix size is specified as a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) mask size.
Note
If you'rederiving a Public IP Prefix from a Custom IP Prefix (BYOIP range), the prefix size can be as large as the Custom IP Prefix.
There aren't limits as to how many prefixes created in a subscription. The number of ranges created can't exceed more static public IP addresses than allowed in your subscription. For more information, seeAzure limits.
Scenarios
You can associate the following resources to a static public IP address from a prefix:
The following resources utilize a public IP address prefix:
Limitations
You can't specify the set of IP addresses for the prefix (though you canspecify which IP you want from the prefix). Azure gives the IP addresses for the prefix, based on the size that you specify. Additionally, all public IP addresses created from the prefix must exist in the same Azure region and subscription as the prefix. Addresses must be assigned to resources in the same region and subscription.

You can create a prefix of up to 16 IP addresses for Microsoft owned prefixes. ReviewNetwork limits increase requestsandAzure limitsfor more information if larger prefixes are required. Also note there's no limit on the number of Public IP Prefixes per region, but the overall number of Public IP addresses per region is limited, and each public IP prefix counts against regional quota for the full count of IPs you can create from that prefix.  (For example, if you create a /29 prefix, 8 Public IPs are consumed from the quota even if no Public IPs have been generated.)

Only static public IP addresses created with the standard SKU can be assigned from the prefix's range. To learn more about public IP address SKUs, seepublic IP address.

Addresses from the range can only be assigned to Azure Resource Manager resources. Addresses can't be assigned to resources in the classic deployment model.

You can't delete a prefix if any addresses within it are assigned to public IP address resources associated to a resource. Dissociate all public IP address resources that are assigned IP addresses from the prefix first. For more information on disassociating public IP addresses, seeManage public IP addresses.

IPv6 is supported on basic public IPs withdynamicallocation only. Dynamic allocation means the IPv6 address changes if you delete and redeploy your resource in Azure.
