This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the SMB protocol of Azure NetApp Files.
Which SMB versions are supported by Azure NetApp Files?
Azure NetApp Files supports SMB 2.1 and SMB 3.1 (which includes support for SMB 3.0).
Can I use Windows Server 2025?
Windows Server 2025 currently doesn't work with the Azure NetApp Files SMB protocol.
Does Azure NetApp Files support access to âoffline filesâ on SMB volumes?
Azure NetApp Files supports 'manual' offline files, allowing users on Windows clients to manually select files to be cached locally.
Is an Active Directory connection required for SMB access?
Yes, you must create an Active Directory connection before deploying an SMB volume. The specified Domain Controllers must be accessible by the delegated subnet of Azure NetApp Files for a successful connection. SeeCreate an SMB volumefor details.
How many Active Directory connections are supported?
Azure NetApp Files now supports the ability tocreate multiple Active Directory (AD) configurations in a subscription.
You can also map multiple NetApp accounts that are under the same subscription and same region to a common AD server created in one of the NetApp accounts. SeeMap multiple NetApp accounts in the same subscription and region to an AD connection.

Does Azure NetApp Files support Microsoft Entra ID?
BothMicrosoft Entra Domain ServicesandActive Directory Domain Services (AD DS)are supported. You can use existing Active Directory domain controllers with Azure NetApp Files. Domain controllers can reside in Azure as virtual machines, or on premises via ExpressRoute or S2S VPN. Azure NetApp Files doesn't support AD join forMicrosoft Entra IDat this time.
If you're using Azure NetApp Files with Microsoft Entra Domain Services, the organizational unit path isOU=AADDC Computerswhen you configure Active Directory for your NetApp account.
OU=AADDC Computers
How do the Netlogon protocol changes in the April 2023 Windows Update affect Azure NetApp Files?
The Windows April 2023 updated included a patch for Netlogon protocol changes, which were not enforced at release.
The upgrades to the Azure NetApp File storage resource have been completed. The enforcement of settingRequireSealvalue to 2 will occur by default with the June 2023 Azure update. No action is required regarding the June 13 enforcement phase.
RequireSeal
For more information about this update, seeKB5021130: How to manage the Netlogon protocol changes related to CVE-2022-38023.
What versions of Windows Server Active Directory are supported?
Azure NetApp Files supports Windows Server 2012-2022 versions of Active Directory Domain Services.
Iâm having issues connecting to my SMB share. What should I do?
As a best practice, set the maximum tolerance for computer clock synchronization to five minutes. For more information, seeMaximum tolerance for computer clock synchronization.
Can I manageSMB Shares,Sessions, andOpen Filesthrough Microsoft Management Console (MMC)?
SMB Shares
Sessions
Open Files
Azure NetApp Files supports modifyingSMB Sharesby using MMC. However, modifying share properties has significant risk. If the users or groups assigned to the share properties are removed from the Active Directory, or if the permissions for the share become unusable, then the entire share will become inaccessible.

How can I obtain the IP address of an SMB volume via the portal?
Use theJSON Viewlink on the volume overview pane, and look for thestartIpidentifier underproperties>mountTargets.
Can Azure NetApp Files SMB volumes be accessed via a web browser such as Microsoft Edge?
No. Azure NetApp Files volumes do not support data access via web browsers.
Can an Azure NetApp Files SMB share act as a DFS Namespace (DFS-N) root?
No. However, Azure NetApp Files SMB shares can serve as a DFS Namespace (DFS-N) folder target.
To use an Azure NetApp Files SMB share as a DFS-N folder target, provide the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) mount path of the Azure NetApp Files SMB share by using theDFS Add Folder Targetprocedure.
Also refer toUse DFS-N and DFS Root Consolidation with Azure NetApp Files.
Can the SMB share permissions be changed?
Azure NetApp Files supports modifyingSMB Sharesby using Microsoft Management Console (MMC). However, modifying share properties has significant risk. If the users or groups assigned to the share properties are removed from the Active Directory, or if the permissions for the share become unusable, then the entire share will become inaccessible.
SMB Shares
SeeModify SMB share permissionsfor more information on this procedure.
Azure NetApp Files also supportsaccess-based enumerationandnon-browsable shareson SMB and dual-protocol volumes. You can enable these features during or after the creation of an SMB or dual-protocol volume.
Can I use the same share name for multiple volumes?
The same share name can be used for:
volumes deployed in different regions
volumes deployed to different availability zones within the same region
If you're using:
regional volumes (without availability zones) or
volumes within the same availability zone,
The same share name can be used, however the share name must be unique within each delegated subnet or assigned to different delegated subnets.
For more information, seeCreate an SMB volume for Azure NetApp FilesorCreate a dual-protocol volume for Azure NetApp Files.
Can I change the SMB share name after the SMB volume has been created?
No. However, you can create a new SMB volume with the new share name from a snapshot of the SMB volume with the old share name.
Alternatively, you can useWindows Server DFS Namespacewhere a DFS Namespace with the new share name can point to the Azure NetApp Files SMB volume with the old share name.
Does Azure NetApp Files support SMB change notification and file locking?
Yes.
Azure NetApp Files supportsCHANGE_NOTIFYresponse. This response is for the clientâs request that comes in the form of aCHANGE_NOTIFYrequest.

CHANGE_NOTIFY
Azure NetApp Files also supportsLOCKresponse. This response is for the clientâs request that comes in the form of aLOCKrequest.

Azure NetApp Files also supportsbreaking file locks.

What network authentication methods are supported for SMB volumes in Azure NetApp Files?
NTLMv2 and Kerberos network authentication methods are supported with SMB volumes in Azure NetApp Files. NTLMv1 and LanManager are disabled and are not supported.
To disable NTLM, see:
Active Directory Hardening Series - Part 1 â Disabling NTLMv1
Network security - Restrict NTLM Incoming NTLM traffic
Network security - Restrict NTLM in this domain
What is the password rotation policy for the Active Directory computer account for SMB volumes?
The Azure NetApp Files service has a policy that automatically updates the password on the Active Directory computer account that is created for SMB volumes. This policy has the following properties:
Schedule interval: 4 weeks
Schedule randomization period: 120 minutes
Schedule: Sunday@0100
@0100
To see  when the password was last updated on the Azure NetApp Files SMB computer account, check thepwdLastSetproperty on the computer account using theAttribute Editorin theActive Directory Users and Computersutility:
pwdLastSet

Note
Due to an interoperability issue with theApril 2022 Monthly Windows Update, the policy that automatically updates the Active Directory computer account password for SMB volumes has been suspended until a fix is deployed.
How do Azure NetApp Files Continuous Availability Shares behave when there's an underlying storage hardware maintenance event?
The SMB client detects a TCP reset. There's no disruption if the SMB client reconnects within 60 seconds.
Does Azure NetApp Files support Alternate Data Streams?
Yes, Azure NetApp Files supportsAlternate Data Streams (ADS)by default onSMB volumesanddual-protocol volumes configured with NTFS security stylewhen accessed via SMB.
What are SMB/CIFSoplocksand are they enabled on Azure NetApp Files volumes?
oplocks
SMB/CIFS oplocks (opportunistic locks) enable the redirector on a SMB/CIFS client in certain file-sharing scenarios to perform client-side caching of read-ahead, write-behind, and lock information. A client can then work with a file (read or write it) without regularly reminding the server that it needs access to the file. This improves performance by reducing network traffic. SMB/CIFS oplocks are enabled on Azure NetApp Files SMB and dual-protocol volumes.
