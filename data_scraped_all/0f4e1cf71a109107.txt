Acquire the Windows Enterprise multi-session image
To use the Windows Enterprise multi-session image, go to Azure Marketplace, and select the version that you want to deploy:

Issues with using the Azure portal to create host pools
Error: "Create a free account" appears when accessing the service

There aren't active subscriptions in the account you signed in to Azure with, or the account doesn't have permissions to view the subscriptions.
Sign in to the subscription where you deploy the session host virtual machines (VMs) with an account that has at least contributor-level access.
Error: "Exceeding quota limit"
If your operation goes over the quota limit, you can do one of the following things:
Create a new host pool with the same parameters but fewer VMs and VM cores.
Open the link you see in thestatusMessagefield in a browser to submit a request to increase the quota for your Azure subscription for the specified VM SKU.

Error: Can't see user assignments in application groups
This error usually occurs after you move the subscription from one Microsoft Entra tenant to another. If your old assignments are still tied to the previous Microsoft Entra tenant, the Azure portal loses track of them.
You need to reassign users to application groups.
I don't see the Azure region I want to use when selecting the location for my service objects
Azure doesn't currently support that region for the Azure Virtual Desktop service. For more information about which geographies we support, check outData locations. If Azure Virtual Desktop supports the location but it still doesn't appear when you're trying to select a location, your resource provider hasn't updated yet.
To get the latest list of regions, re-register the resource provider:
Go toSubscriptionsand select the relevant subscription.
SelectResource Provider.
SelectMicrosoft.DesktopVirtualization, and then selectRe-registerfrom the action menu.
When you re-register the resource provider, you won't see any specific UI feedback or update statuses. The re-registration process also won't interfere with your existing environments.
Azure Resource Manager template errors
Follow these instructions to troubleshoot unsuccessful deployments of Azure Resource Manager templates and PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC).
Review errors in the deployment usingView deployment operations with Azure Resource Manager.
If there are no errors in the deployment, review errors in the activity log usingView activity logs to audit actions on resources.
Once the error is identified, use the error message and the resources inTroubleshoot common Azure deployment errors with Azure Resource Managerto address the issue.
Delete any resources created during the previous deployment and retry deploying the template.

Credentials provided for joining VMs to the domain are incorrect.
See the "Incorrect credentials" error for VMs that aren't joined to the domain inSession host VM configuration.
Domain name doesn't resolve.
SeeError: Domain name doesn't resolveinSession host VM configuration.
Your virtual network (virtual network) DNS configuration is set toDefault.
To fix this issue, take the following steps:
Open the Azure portal and go to theVirtual networkstab.
Find your virtual network, and then selectDNS servers.
The DNS servers menu should appear on the right side of your screen. On that menu, selectCustom.
Make sure the DNS servers listed underCustommatch your domain controller or Active Directory domain. If you don't see your DNS server, you can add it by entering its value into theAdd DNS serverfield.

The subscription you're using is a type that can't access required features in the region where the customer is trying to deploy. For example, MSDN, Free, or Education subscriptions can show this error.
Change your subscription type or region to one that can access the required features.

Part of the resource group name is used for certain resources being created by the template. Due to the name matching existing resources, the template might select an existing resource from a different group.
When running the Azure Resource Manager template to deploy session host VMs, make the first two characters unique for your subscription resource group name.

Use a different host prefix.

Remove blocking static route, firewall rule, or NSG. Optionally, open the Azure Resource Manager template json file in a text editor, take the link to zip file, and download the resource to an allowed location.
Error: Can't delete a session host from the host pool after deleting the VM
You need to delete the session host before you delete the VM.
Put the session host in drain mode, sign out all users from the session host, and then delete the host.
