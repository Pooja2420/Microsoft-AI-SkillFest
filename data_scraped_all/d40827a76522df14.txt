Today, businesses, and corporations are increasingly deploying a combination of on-premises and cloud applications. Users require access to those applications both on-premises and in the cloud. Managing users both on-premises and in the cloud poses challenging scenarios.
Microsoftâs identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities. These solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. We call thishybrid identity.

Hybrid identity is accomplished through provisioning and synchronization. Provisioning is the process of creating an object based on certain conditions, keeping the object up to date and deleting the object when conditions are no longer met. Synchronization is responsible for making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud.
