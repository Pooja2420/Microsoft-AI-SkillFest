Warning
Azure Media Services will be retired June 30th, 2024. For more information, see theAMS Retirement Guide.
High availability for VOD
There is a high availability design pattern calledGeodesin the Azure Architecture documentation. It describes how duplicate resources are deployed to different geographic regions to provide scalability and resiliency.  You can use Azure services to create such an architecture to cover many high availability design considerations such as redundancy, health monitoring, load balancing, and data backup and recovery.  One such architecture is described below with details on each service used in the solution as well as how the individual services can be used to create a high availability architecture for your VOD application.
Sample
There is a sample available for you to use to become familiar with high availability with Media Services and Video on Demand (VOD). It also goes into more detail about how the services are used for a VOD scenario.  The sample is not intended to be used in production in its current form.  A production implementation of high availability for Video on Demand (VOD) should also carefully review their Content Delivery Network (CDN) strategy.
Overview of services
The services used in this example architecture include:
Architecture
This high-level diagram shows the architecture of the sample provided to get you started with high availability and media services.

Best practices
Regions
Createtwo (or more) Azure Media Services accounts. The two accounts need to be in different regions. For more information, seeRegions in which the Azure Media Services service is deployed.
Upload your media to the same region from which you are planning to submit the job.
If you then need to resubmit thejobto another region, you can useJobInputHttpor useCopy-Blobto copy the data from the source Asset container to an Asset container in the alternate region.

Monitoring
Subscribe forJobStateChangemessages in each account via Azure Event Grid.Use theMicrosoft.Azure.EventGrid SDK(which supports Media Services events natively).You can also consume Event Grid events via Azure Functions.For more information:See theAudio Analytics samplewhich shows how to monitor a job with Azure Event Grid including adding a fallback in case the Azure Event Grid messages are delayed for some reason.

When you create ajob:Randomly select an account from the list of currently used accounts (this list will normally contain both accounts but if issues are detected it may contain only one account). If the list is empty, raise an alert so an operator can investigate.Create a record to keep track of each inflight job and the region/account used.

JobStateChange
When yourJobStateChangehandler gets a notification that a job has reached the processing state, mark the record for the job as processing and record the time it enters the processing state.

JobStateChange
When yourJobStateChangehandler gets a notification that a job has reached a final state (Finished/Errored/Canceled), mark the record for the job appropriately.

JobStateChange
Have a separate process that periodically looks at your records of the jobsIf you have jobs in the scheduled state that haven't advanced to the processing state in a reasonable amount of time for a given region, remove that region from your list of currently used accounts. Depending on your business requirements, you could decide to cancel those jobs right away and resubmit them to the other region. Or, you could give them some more time to move to the next state.If a region was removed from the account list, monitor it for recovery before adding it back to the list. The regional health can be monitored via the existing jobs on the region (if they weren't canceled and resubmitted), by adding the account back to the list after a period of time, and by operators monitoring Azure communications about outages that may be affecting Azure Media Services.
