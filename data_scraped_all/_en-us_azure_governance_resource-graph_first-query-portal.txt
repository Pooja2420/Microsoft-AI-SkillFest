This quickstart describes how to run an Azure Resource Graph query in the Azure portal using Azure Resource Graph Explorer. Resource Graph Explorer allows you to query information about the Azure Resource Manager resource types and properties. Resource Graph Explorer also provides an interface for working with multiple queries, evaluating the results, and even converting the results of some queries into a chart that can be pinned to an Azure dashboard.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure account, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Run a query
Run a query from the Azure portal using Azure Resource Graph Explorer.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forresource graphand selectResource Graph Explorer.
Search forresource graphand selectResource Graph Explorer.

If you need to change the scope, selectDirectory. Then select the directory, management group, or subscription for the resources you want to query.

In theQuery 1portion of the window, copy and paste the following query. Then selectRun query.resources
| project name, type
| limit 5This query example doesn't provide a sort modifier likeorder by. If you run the query multiple times, it might yield a different set of resources for each request.

This query example doesn't provide a sort modifier likeorder by. If you run the query multiple times, it might yield a different set of resources for each request.
order by
Review the query response in theResultstab and select theMessagestab to see details about the query, including the count of results and duration of the query. Errors, if any, are displayed inMessages.

Update the query toorder bythenameproperty. Then, selectRun queryresources
| project name, type
| limit 5
| order by name ascLike the previous query, running this query multiple times might yield a different set of resources for each request. The order of the query commands is important. In this example, theorder bycomes after thelimit. The query limits the results to five resources and then orders those results by name.

Schema browser
The schema browser is located in the left pane of Resource Graph Explorer. This list of resources shows all theresource typesof Azure resources supported by Azure Resource Graph and that exist in your tenant. Select a resource type or property to show child properties that can be used to create a Resource Graph query.
Select a table name from the schema browser and it gets added to the query. When you select a resource type it gets added to the query, likewhere type =="<resource type>". If you select a property it gets added to the next line in the query, likewhere <propertyName> == "INSERT_VALUE_HERE". You can use the schema browser to find properties that you can use in queries. Be sure to replaceINSERT_VALUE_HEREwith your own value, and adjust the query with conditions, operators, and functions.
where type =="<resource type>"
where <propertyName> == "INSERT_VALUE_HERE"
INSERT_VALUE_HERE
This example shows a query that was built from the schema browser by selecting the tableauthorizationresourceswith resource typemicrosoft.authorization/roledefinitionsand the propertyroleName.
authorizationresources
microsoft.authorization/roledefinitions
roleName
authorizationresources
| where type == "microsoft.authorization/roledefinitions"
| where properties['roleName'] == "INSERT_VALUE_HERE"
authorizationresources
| where type == "microsoft.authorization/roledefinitions"
| where properties['roleName'] == "INSERT_VALUE_HERE"

Download query results as a CSV file
To download comma-separated values (CSV) results from the Azure portal, browse to the Azure Resource Graph Explorer and run a query. On the toolbar, selectDownload as CSVas shown in the following screenshot:

When you use theDownload as CSVexport functionality of Azure Resource Graph Explorer, the result set is limited to 55,000 records. This limitation is a platform limit that can't be overridden by filing an Azure support ticket.
Create a chart from query results
You can create charts from queries that output a count for the number of resources. Queries that output lists can't be made into a chart. If you try to create a chart from a list, a message likethe result set isn't compatible with a donut chart visualizationis displayed in theChartstab.
To create a chart from query results, do the following steps:
In theQuery 1portion of the window, enter the following query and selectRun query.resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
| summarize count() by tostring(properties.storageProfile.osDisk.osType)
In theQuery 1portion of the window, enter the following query and selectRun query.

| summarize count() by tostring(properties.storageProfile.osDisk.osType)
resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
| summarize count() by tostring(properties.storageProfile.osDisk.osType)
Select theResultstab and note that the response for this query provides counts.

Select theChartstab. Change the type fromSelect chart type...to eitherBar chartorDonut chart.

Pin query visualization to dashboard
When you have results from a query that can be visualized, that data visualization can be pinned to your Azure portal dashboard. After running the previous query, follow these steps:
SelectSaveand use the nameVirtual machine by OS typeand type asPrivate queries. Then selectSaveat the bottom of the right pane.
SelectRun queryto rerun the query you saved.
On theChartstab, select a data visualization. Then selectPin to dashboard.
FromPin to Dashboardselect the existing dashboard where you want the chart to appear.
SelectDashboardfrom thehamburger menu(three horizontal lines) on the top, left side of any portal page.
The query is now available on your dashboard with the titleVirtual machine by OS type. If the query wasn't saved before it was pinned, the name isQuery 1instead.
The query and resulting data visualization run and update each time the dashboard loads, providing real time and dynamic insights to your Azure environment directly in your workflow.
Queries that result in a list can also be pinned to the dashboard. The feature isn't limited to data visualizations of queries.
When a query is run from the portal, you can selectDirectoryto change the query's scope for the directory, management group, or subscription of the resources you want to query. WhenPin to dashboardis selected, the results are added to your Azure dashboard with the scope used when the query was run.
For more information about working with dashboards, seeCreate a dashboard in the Azure portal.
Clean up resources
If you want to remove the sample Resource Graph dashboards from your Azure portal environment, do the following steps:
SelectDashboardfrom thehamburger menu(three horizontal lines) on the top, left side of any portal page.
On your dashboard, find theVirtual machine by OS typechart and select the ellipsis (...) to display the menu.
...
SelectRemove from dashboardselectSaveto confirm.
If you want to delete saved queries, likeVirtual machine by OS type, do the following steps:
Go to Azure Resource Graph Explorer.
SelectOpen a query.
SelectTypePrivate queries.
FromQuery nameselect the rubbish bin icon toDelete this query.
SelectYesto confirm the deletion.
