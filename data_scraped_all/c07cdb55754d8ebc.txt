To support the addition of new features, changes are introduced periodically to the core system processes or process templateâAgile,Scrum, orCMMI. A processâused by the Inheritance process modelâdetermines the building blocks used to track work. A process templateâused by the Hosted XML and On-premises XML process modelsâspecifies an interdependent-related set of XML definition files that provide the building blocks and initial configuration for tracking work and other functional areas. For an overview of process models and customization options, seeCustomize your work tracking experience.
Note
This article describes changes made to the core system processes with updates made to Azure DevOps Services and on-premises Azure DevOps Server, formerly named Team Foundation Server (TFS). These processes are available for both cloud and on-premises versions of Azure Boards. Projects hosted on Azure Boardsupdate automatically with each service upgrade. Whereas, updates to projects defined on-premises may require running the Configure Feature Wizard after upgrading to a later version.
The Configure Features Wizard has been deprecated for Azure DevOps Server 2019. You can only run the wizard on TFS 2018 and earlier versions.If you've customized your project and haven't upgraded your on-premises deployment for a while, you may need to manually apply some changes to gain access to new features. Review the following table to determine which changes may apply to your situation. SeeNew features added when you upgradefor a description of each feature added with the updates.

Azure DevOps Server 2020.1
Azure DevOps Services (October 2020)
Removed system ruleAssign work item to the person who created it when the bug is moved to the Resolved statefrom the Bug work item type in the Agile process.For those customers who want to continue using this rule, you can add the followingcustom workflow rulesrule to the Bug in your process:

Azure DevOps Server 2020.1Azure DevOps Services (August 2020)
The logic managing theActivated By,Activated Date,Resolved By, andResolved Datefields has changed. The values assigned to these fields are now governed based on the state categories ofProposedandResolved. To learn more, seeQuery by assignment or workflow changes.
Azure DevOps Server 2019
Predefined Shared Queries are no longer created upon project creation. The definitions for Shared Queries have been removed from the process template. Shared Queries defined in custom process templates are created. You can also add Shared Queries to a process template as described inAdd work item queries to a process template.
TFS 2017
Added theWebLayoutsection within theFORMsection of all work item type (WIT) definitions. This section supports the new work item tracking experience in the web portal. It includes theSystemControlssection and the newLinksControlOptionsfor managing link relationships.  To learn more, seeNew work item experience,WebLayout and Control elements, andLinksControlOptions XML elements (Web form).
Note
When you upgrade an on-premises Azure DevOps to TFS 2017, the new web form is automatically available when you add projects to a collection. For existing projects, an administrator is required toenable the new form. The reason the new form isn't automatically enabled for existing projects is to prevent overwriting customizations made to existing WIT definitions.
TFS 2015
Added the Bugs Behavior feature, and enhancements to the Planning Tools and Portfolio Backlogs features. Several enhancements were made to support theScaled Agile Framework (SAFe).
Process template names have been changed to Agile, CMMI, and Scrum and have been repurposed as locked, system templates. You can export these templates for customization, but you can no longer overwrite these templates with your changes.
Second-level portfolio backlog, Epic, plus configurable option for teams to activate portfolio backlogs.
Team configurable option to choose which backlogs and portfolio backlogs are active.
TrackingTime Criticalityof portfolio backlog items. TheTime Criticalityfield captures how the business value reduces over time for a Feature or Epic. Higher values indicate that the item is inherently more time critical than those items with lower values.
Tracking theValue Areafor portfolio backlog and backlog items. TheValue Areafield differentiates items based on work done to supportArchitecturalrequirements orBusinessneeds.
Supportany-to-any workflow transitionson Agile boards.
Team configurable option to choose to track bugs on backlogs and boards either as requirements or as tasks. This required adding fields to the bug WIT definition and adding a process configuration behavior.

Build changes: Removed the build templates from the build plug-in. You now access build templates through the user interface [Use the Default Template for your build process](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/dd647547(v=vs.120).
Reporting Services updates: To update your project with the latest reports, seeUpload reports to a project.
TFS 2012.1
Added the Portfolio Backlog feature and introduced changes to support Planning Tools.
Each of the default process templates that TFS provides was updated to support other regressive transitions. These transitions, shown in red in the following illustration, support moving items back to the backlog when they were incorrectly set to done or resolved. Now when you inadvertently drag a work item on the Kanban board or the taskboard to a resolved or closed state, you can drag it back to an earlier workflow state.The following work item types now support any-to-any workflow transitions:
Visual Studio Scrum 2.1: Bug, Product Backlog Item, Task
MSF Agile 6.1: Bug, Task, User Story
MSF Scrum 6.1: Bug, Task, Requirement
To apply the changes to your existing projects, you need to replace theWORKFLOWsections defined for each of the updated work item types with the new definitions. You can do this by modifying the work item type definition. SeeDesign the WorkflowandImport, export, and manage Work Item Types.
TFS 2012 RTM
Added the Code Review, My Work, Feedback, Storyboarding, and Planning Tools features.
WITs added:Code Review Request, Code Review Response, Feedback Request, and Feedback ResponseWIT form changes:
Many work item forms have been updated to display the larger font for theTitlefield and a two-column layout of tab groups

Updated support files that contain forward links to process guidance content to point to the latest content.

version
Removed theSprinttype definition andAll Sprintsquery, whose functionality has been replaced with the Agile planning tools.
Removed theBacklog Priorityfield from the work item form for the Product Backlog type definition. This field is used in the background to track the relative priority of items displayed on the backlog pages.
TheRemovedstate was added to the workflow state for the Bug, Product Backlog Item, and Task type definitions, which supports removing cut items from the backlog.
Added theStoryboardstab to the Product Backlog Item type definition.
Added theBacklog Overview reportto the set of SQL Server Reporting Services reports, similar to the AgileStories Overview report.
TheNewstate was added as the initial state for User Stories and Tasks. This change was introduced to support transitioning User Stories and Tasks from aNewstate to anActivestate. Without theNewstate, User Stories assigned to an iteration remain on the product backlog until they are resolved, which is not a desired or expected behavior. To learn more, see [Update the Workflow for Agile Team Projects](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2012/hh500412(v=vs.110).
To support removing cut work items from the backlog, theRemovedstate was added to the workflow state for the following work item types: User Story and Task.
Added theStoryboardstab to the User Story work item type.
The Product Planning and Iteration Backlog Excel workbooks have been removed. The Agile planning tools replace this functionality.
Requirement: Added theSizefield used in calculating team velocity and forecast; added theStoryboardstab
Shared queries: AddedCorrective ActionandMitigation Action.
