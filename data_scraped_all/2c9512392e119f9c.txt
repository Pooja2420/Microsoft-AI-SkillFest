This article provides service limits for Azure Chaos Studio. For more information about Azure-wide service limits and quotas, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints.
Experiment and target limits
Chaos Studio applies limits to the number of resources, duration of activities, and retention of data.
API throttling limits
Chaos Studio applies limits to all Azure Resource Manager operations. Requests made over the limit are throttled. All request limits are applied for afive-minute intervalunless otherwise specified. For more information about Azure Resource Manager requests, seeThrottling Resource Manager requests.
Recommended actions
If you have feedback on the current quotas and limits, submit a feedback request inCommunity Feedback.
Currently, you can't request increases to Chaos Studio quotas, but a request process is in development.
If you expect to exceed the maximum concurrent experiments executing per region and subscription:
Split your experiments across regions. Experiments can target resources outside the experiment resource's region or target multiple resources across different regions.
Test more scenarios in each experiment by using more actions, steps, and/or branches (up to the maximum current limits).
If your testing requires longer experiments than the currently supported duration:
Run multiple experiments in sequence.
If you want to see experiment execution history:
Use Chaos Studio'sREST APIwith the "executionDetails" endpoint, for each experiment ID.
