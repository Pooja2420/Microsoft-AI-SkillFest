Important
This connector can be used inReal-Time Intelligencein Microsoft Fabric. Use the instructions in this article with the following exceptions:
If required, create databases using the instructions inCreate a KQL database.
If required, create tables using the instructions inCreate an empty table.
Get query or ingestion URIs using the instructions inCopy URI.
Run queries in aKQL queryset.
The Azure Data Explorer connector for Power Automate (previously Microsoft Flow) enables you to orchestrate and schedule flows, send notifications, and alerts, as part of a scheduled or triggered task.
You can:
Send notifications and alerts based on query results, such as when thresholds exceed certain limits.
Send regular, such as daily or weekly, reports containing tables and charts.
Schedule regular jobs using management commands on clusters. For example, copy data from one table to another using the.set-or-appendcommand.
.set-or-append
Export and import data between Azure Data Explorer and other databases.
For more information, seeAzure Data Explorer Power Automate connector usage examples.
Note
In order for a Power Automate connector to access anetwork protected cluster, you must add theoutbound IP addressesassociated with the region of your connector to the firewall allowlist. For more information, seeManage public access to your Azure Data Explorer cluster.
Create a new flow using the Azure Data Explorer connector
To use the connector, you must first add a trigger. You can define a trigger based on a recurring time period, or as a response to a previous flow action.

Flow actions
When you select the Azure Data Explorer connector, you can choose one of the following actions to add to your flow:
Run KQL query
Run KQL query and render a chart
Run async management command
Run management command and render a chart
Run show management command
This section describes the capabilities and parameters for each action and provides an example showing how to add anemailaction to any flow.
Run KQL query
Note
If your query starts with a dot, it's amanagement command. UseRun async management command.
Use this action to query the specified cluster. The actions that are added afterwards iterate over each line of the results of the query.
If the query takes more than 8 minutes to run, it will fail with a "RequestTimeout" exception. To prevent this issue, optimize your query or divide it into smaller parts. For more information, seeQuery best practices.
The following flow triggers a query every minute. The query checks the number of records in the table, and then sends an email only if the number of records is greater than 0.

Run KQL query and render a chart
Note
If your query starts with a dot, it's amanagement command. UseRun management command and render a chart.
Use this action to visualize a KQL query result as a table or chart. For example, use this flow to receive daily reports by email.
If the query takes more than 8 minutes to run, it will fail with a "RequestTimeout" exception. To prevent this issue, optimize your query or divide it into smaller parts. For more information, seeQuery best practices.
The following flow will present the query results as a timechart.

Run async management command
Use this action to run amanagement commandasynchronously, which means it will continue to run in the background. The action returns an ID, state, and status. To check the status and details of an async command, use the.show operationscommand with the ID returned by this action.
If the async management command takes more than 60 minutes to run, it will fail with a "RequestTimeout" exception.
The following flow triggers an async command to copy 10 records from the 'TransformedSysLogs' table to the 'TargetTable'. Note that the 'async' keyword is required in the query.

Run management command and render a chart
Use this action to run amanagement commandand display the result as a chart. The chart options include an HTML table, pie chart, time chart, and bar chart.
If the management command takes more than 8 minutes to run, it will fail with a "RequestTimeout" exception.

Run show management command
This action runs the show management command and returns the result that can be used in the following connectors.
If the management command takes more than 8 minutes to run, it will fail with a "RequestTimeout" exception.
The following flow runs the.show operationcommand to find the status of an async command using an operation ID returned by an async command execution.

Email Kusto query results
You can include a step in any flow to send reports by email, to any email address.
Select+ New Stepto add a new step to your flow.
In the search box, enterOffice 365and selectOffice 365 Outlook.
SelectSend an email (V2).
Enter the email address to which you want the email report sent.
Enter the subject of the email.
SelectCode view.
Place your cursor in theBodyfield, and selectAdd dynamic content.
SelectBodyHtml.
SelectShow advanced options.

UnderAttachments Content, selectAttachment Content.
If necessary, add more attachments.
If necessary, set the importance level.
SelectSave.

Create an Azure Data Explorer connection
To run a flow that contains an Azure Data Explorer connector, you must use a valid Azure Data Explorerconnection. You can create and authenticate a new connection from the Power Automate left pane, selectData>Connectionsor from within the flow, by selecting the Azure Data Explorer connector's menu >Add new connection.
The following steps show how to create a connection from within a flow.
InRun KQL query, select the three dots at the top right of the power automate connector.
InRun KQL query, select the three dots at the top right of the power automate connector.

SelectAdd new connection. When you connect for the first time, you're prompted to sign in toauthenticate the connection.
SelectAdd new connection. When you connect for the first time, you're prompted to sign in toauthenticate the connection.

Authentication
You can authenticate with user credentials or with a Microsoft Entra application. To authenticate with credentials, selectSign in, and enter your credentials.
To authenticate with a Service Principal:
SelectConnect with Service Principal.
SelectConnect with Service Principal.
Fill out the form with the following information:Connection Name: A descriptive and meaningful name for the new connection. In this example, we've used "MyApplication".Client ID: Your application ID.Client Secret: Your application key.Tenant: The ID of the Microsoft Entra directory in which you created the application.NoteMake sure your application is anMicrosoft Entra applicationand is authorized to run queries on your cluster.When authentication is complete, verify that your flow uses the new connection.Once the connection is set, the flow runs using the application credentials.

Connection Name: A descriptive and meaningful name for the new connection. In this example, we've used "MyApplication".
Client ID: Your application ID.
Client Secret: Your application key.
Tenant: The ID of the Microsoft Entra directory in which you created the application.
Note
Make sure your application is anMicrosoft Entra applicationand is authorized to run queries on your cluster.

When authentication is complete, verify that your flow uses the new connection.

Once the connection is set, the flow runs using the application credentials.
Test the flow
To check if your flow works, check the flow's run history:
Go to thePower Automate home page.
Go to thePower Automate home page.
From the main menu, selectMy flows.
From the main menu, selectMy flows.

On the row of the flow you want to investigate, select the more commands icon, and then selectRun history.All flow runs are listed, with information about start time, duration, and status.For full details about the flow, onMy flows, select the flow you want to investigate.

All flow runs are listed, with information about start time, duration, and status.
For full details about the flow, onMy flows, select the flow you want to investigate.

To see why a run failed, select the run start time. The flow appears, and the step of the flow that failed is indicated by a red exclamation point. Expand the failed step to view its details. TheDetailspane on the right contains information about the failure so that you can troubleshoot it.

Limitations
The maximum number of records per request is 50,000 and the maximum data size per request is 32 MB. These limits can't be changed.
Synchronous requests have a timeout of 8 minutes.
Asynchronous requests have a timeout of 60 minutes.
The connector doesn't support operators that aren't supported by thegetschemaoperator. For example, thefork,facet, andevaluateoperators aren't supported.
getschema
Flows work best on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.
