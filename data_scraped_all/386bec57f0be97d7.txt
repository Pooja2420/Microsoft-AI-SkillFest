Learn what Azure Machine Learning features are available in the Azure Government, Azure Germany, and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet regions.
In the list of global Azure regions, there are several regions that serve specific markets in addition to the public cloud regions. For example, the Azure Government and the Azure operated by 21Vianet regions. Azure Machine Learning is deployed into the following regions, in addition to public cloud regions:
Azure Government regionsUS-ArizonaandUS-Virginia.
Azure operated by 21Vianet regionChina-East-2.
Azure Machine Learning is still in development in air-gap Regions.
For the Italy North Region, Application Insights isn't available until 12/12/2023 without allowlist. This will affect the following service until then - Job schedule  - Feature store  - Model monitor - Data import
The information in the rest of this document provides information on what features of Azure Machine Learning are available in these regions, along with region-specific information on using these features.

For scheduled pipelines, we also provide a blob-based trigger mechanism. This mechanism isn't supported for CMK workspaces. For enabling a blob-based trigger for CMK workspaces, you have to do extra setup. For more information, seeTrigger a run of a machine learning pipeline from a Logic App (SDK/CLI v1).
