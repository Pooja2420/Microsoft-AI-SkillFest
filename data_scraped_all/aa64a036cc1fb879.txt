Assumptions
You have an understanding of Oracle Data Guard design and Azure environments.
Goals
Design the topology and configuration that meet your disaster recovery (DR) requirements.
Scenario 1: Primary and DR sites on Azure
A customer has an Oracle database set up on the primary site. A DR site is in a different region. The customer uses Oracle Data Guard for quick recovery between these sites. The primary site also has a secondary database for reporting and other uses.
Topology
The following shows a summary of the Azure setup:
Two sites (a primary site and a DR site)
Two virtual networks
Two Oracle databases with Data Guard (primary and standby)
Two Oracle databases with Golden Gate or Data Guard (primary site only)
Two application services, one primary and one on the DR site
Anavailability set,which is used for database and application service on the primary site
One jumpbox on each site, which restricts access to the private network and only allows sign-in by an administrator
A jumpbox, application service, database, and VPN gateway on separate subnets
NSG enforced on application and database subnets

Scenario 2: Primary site on-premises and DR site on Azure
A customer has an on-premises Oracle database setup (primary site). A DR site is on Azure. Oracle Data Guard is used for quick recovery between these sites. The primary site also has a secondary database for reporting and other uses.
There are two approaches for this setup.
Approach 1: Direct connections between on-premises and Azure, requiring open TCP ports on the firewall
We don't recommend direct connections because they expose the TCP ports to the outside world.
Following is a summary of the Azure setup:
One DR site
One virtual network
One Oracle database with Data Guard (active)
One application service on the DR site
One jumpbox, which restricts access to the private network and only allows sign-in by an administrator
A jumpbox, application service, database, and VPN gateway on separate subnets
NSG enforced on application and database subnets
An NSG policy/rule to allow inbound TCP port 1521 (or a user-defined port)
An NSG policy/rule to restrict only the IP address/addresses on-premises (DB or application) to access the virtual network

Approach 2: Site-to-site VPN
Site-to-site VPN is a better approach. For more information about setting up a VPN, seeCreate a virtual network with a Site-to-Site VPN connection using CLI.
Following is a summary of the Azure setup:
One DR site
One virtual network
One Oracle database with Data Guard (active)
One application service on the DR site
One jumpbox, which restricts access to the private network and only allows sign-in by an administrator
A jumpbox, application service, database, and VPN gateway are on separate subnets
NSG enforced on application and database subnets
Site-to-site VPN connection between on-premises and Azure
