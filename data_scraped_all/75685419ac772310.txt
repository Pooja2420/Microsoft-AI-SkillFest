The Azure DNS private zones autoregistration feature manages DNS records for virtual machines deployed in a virtual network. When youlink a virtual networkwith a private DNS zone with this setting enabled, a DNS record gets created for each virtual machine deployed in the virtual network.
For each virtual machine, an address (A) record is created. DNS records for newly deployed virtual machines are also automatically created in the linked private DNS zone. When a virtual machine gets deleted or stopped, the autoregistered DNS records associated with this virtual machine are removed from the private DNS zone.
To enable autoregistration, select the checkbox forEnable auto registrationwhen you create the virtual network link.

Restrictions
Autoregistration works only for virtual machines. For all other resources like internal load balancers, you can create DNS records manually in the private DNS zone linked to the virtual network.
DNS records are created automatically only for the primary virtual machine NIC. If your virtual machines have more than one NIC, you can manually create the DNS records for other network interfaces.
A specific virtual network can be linked to only one private DNS zone when automatic registration is enabled. You can, however, link multiple virtual networks to a single DNS zone.
Autoregistration doesn't support reverse DNS pointer (PTR) records.
