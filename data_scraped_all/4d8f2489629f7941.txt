APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
This article shows steps to add an API manuallyÂ to the API Management instance. When you want to mock the API, you can create a blank API or define it manually. For details about mocking an API, seeMock API responses.
If you want to import an existing API, seerelated contentsection.
In this article, we create a blank API and specifyhttpbin.org(a public testing service) as a backend API.
Prerequisites
Complete the following quickstart:Create an Azure API Management instance
Go to your API Management instance
In the Azureportal, search for and selectAPI Management services:
In the Azureportal, search for and selectAPI Management services:

On theAPI Management servicespage, select your API Management instance:
On theAPI Management servicespage, select your API Management instance:

Create an API
Navigate to your API Management service in the Azure portal and selectAPIsfrom the menu.
From the left menu, select+ Add API.
SelectHTTPfrom the list.
Enter the backendWeb service URL(for example,https://httpbin.org) and other settings for the API. The settings are explained in theImport and publish your first APItutorial.
https://httpbin.org
SelectCreate.
At this point, you have no operations in API Management that map to the operations in your backend API. If you call an operation that is exposed through the back end but not through the API Management, you get a404.
Note
By default, when you add an API, even if it's connected to some backend service, API Management won't expose any operations until you allow them. To allow an operation of your backend service, create an API Management operation that maps to the backend operation.
Add and test an operation
This section shows how to add a "/get" operation to map it to the back end "http://httpbin.org/get" operation.
Add an operation
Select the API you created in the previous step.
Select+ Add Operation.
In theURL, selectGETand enter/getin the resource.
/get
Enter "FetchData" forDisplay name.
SelectSave.
Test an operation
Test the operation in the Azure portal. You can also test it in theDeveloper portal.
Select theTesttab.
SelectFetchData.
PressSend.
The response that the "http://httpbin.org/get" operation generates appears. If you want to transform your operations, seeTransform and protect your API.
Add and test a parameterized operation
This section shows how to add an operation that takes a parameter. In this case, we map the operation to "http://httpbin.org/status/200".
Add the operation
Select the API you created in the previous step.
Select+ Add Operation.
In theURL, selectGETand enter/status/{code}in the resource. Optionally, you can provide some information associated with this parameter. For example, enter "Number" forTYPE, "200" (default) forVALUES.
/status/{code}
Enter "GetStatus" forDisplay name.
SelectSave.
Test the operation
Test the operation in the Azure portal. You can also test it in theDeveloper portal.
Select theTesttab.
Select theTesttab.
SelectGetStatus. By default the code value is set to "200". You can change it to test other values. For example, type "418".
SelectGetStatus. By default the code value is set to "200". You can change it to test other values. For example, type "418".
PressSend.The response that the "http://httpbin.org/status/200" operation generates appears. If you want to transform your operations, seeTransform and protect your API.
PressSend.
The response that the "http://httpbin.org/status/200" operation generates appears. If you want to transform your operations, seeTransform and protect your API.
Add and test a wildcard operation
This section shows how to add a wildcard operation. A wildcard operation lets you pass an arbitrary value with an API request. Instead of creating separate GET operations as shown in the previous sections, you could create a wildcard GET operation.
Caution
Use care when configuring a wildcard operation. This configuration may make an API more vulnerable to certainAPI security threats.
Add the operation
Select the API you created in the previous step.
Select+ Add Operation.
In theURL, selectGETand enter/*in the resource.
/*
Enter "WildcardGet" forDisplay name.
SelectSave.
Test the operation
Test the operation in the Azure portal. You can also test it in theDeveloper portal.
Select theTesttab.
Select theTesttab.
SelectWildcardGet. Try the GET operations that you tested in previous sections, or try a different supported GET operation.For example, inTemplate parameters, update the value next to the wildcard (*) name toheaders. The operation returns the incoming request's HTTP headers.
SelectWildcardGet. Try the GET operations that you tested in previous sections, or try a different supported GET operation.
For example, inTemplate parameters, update the value next to the wildcard (*) name toheaders. The operation returns the incoming request's HTTP headers.
headers
PressSend.The response that the "http://httpbin.org/headers" operation generates appears. If you want to transform your operations, seeTransform and protect your API.
PressSend.
The response that the "http://httpbin.org/headers" operation generates appears. If you want to transform your operations, seeTransform and protect your API.
Note
It can be important to understand how the host for the backend API you're integrating with handles trailing slashes on an operation URL. For more information, see thisAPI Management FAQ.
Append other APIs
You can compose an API out of APIs that are exposed by different services, including:
An OpenAPI specification
A SOAP API
A GraphQL API
A Web App that's hosted in Azure App Service
Azure Functions
Azure Logic Apps
Azure Service Fabric
Note
When you import an API, the operations are appended to your current API.
To append an API to an existing API:
Go to your Azure API Management instance in the Azure portal:
Go to your Azure API Management instance in the Azure portal:

SelectAPIson theOverviewpage or selectAPIs>APIsin the menu on the left.
SelectAPIson theOverviewpage or selectAPIs>APIsin the menu on the left.

Select the ellipsis (...) next to the API that you want to append another API to.
