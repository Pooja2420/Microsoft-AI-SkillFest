Resources and workloads protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud are assessed against built-in and custom security standards enabled in your Azure subscriptions, AWS accounts, and GCP projects. Based on those assessments, security recommendations provide practical steps to remediate security issues, and improve security posture.
This article describes how to remediate security recommendations in your Defender for Cloud deployment.
Before you attempt to remediate a recommendation you should review it in detail. Learn how toreview security recommendations.

Use the Fix option
To simplify the remediation process, a Fix button might appear in a recommendation. The Fix button helps you quickly remediate a recommendation on multiple resources. If the Fix button is not present in the recommendation, then there is no option to apply a quick fix, and you must follow the presented remediation steps to address the recommendation.
