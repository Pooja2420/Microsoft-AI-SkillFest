This article describes how to collect logs and troubleshoot issues with Azure Local VMs enabled by Azure Arc. It also lists the current limitations and known issues with Azure Local VM management, along with recommended resolutions.
Failure when trying to enable guest management
When trying to run the command to enable guest management, you see the following error:
Error:Deployment failed. Correlation ID: aaaa0000-bb11-2222-33cc-444444dddddd. VM Spec validation failed for guest agent provisioning: Invalid managed identity. A system-assigned managed identity must be enabled in parent resource: Invalid Configuration
Deployment failed. Correlation ID: aaaa0000-bb11-2222-33cc-444444dddddd. VM Spec validation failed for guest agent provisioning: Invalid managed identity. A system-assigned managed identity must be enabled in parent resource: Invalid Configuration
This failure is because the managed identity wasn't created for this VM. System-assigned Managed Identity is required to enable guest management.
Resolution:
Follow these steps to verify that the Managed Identity isn't created for this VM and then enable System-assigned Managed Identity.
In the Azure portal, go to the VM. Browse to theOverviewpage. On thePropertiestab, underConfiguration, theGuest managementshould show asDisabled. Select theJSON Viewfrom the top right corner.

Failure deploying a VM image from a storage account
You see the following error when trying to deploy a VM image from a storage account on your Azure Local:
Error:{"code":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=AuthorizationPermissionMismatch) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n","message":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=AuthorizationPermissionMismatch) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n"}
{"code":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=AuthorizationPermissionMismatch) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n","message":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=AuthorizationPermissionMismatch) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n"}
Or, you see this error:
Error:{"code":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=NoAuthenticationInformation) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n","message":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=NoAuthenticationInformation) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n"}
{"code":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=NoAuthenticationInformation) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n","message":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=NoAuthenticationInformation) =====\nDescription=, Details: (none)\n"}
The failure occurs because the user creating the image does not have the right permissions to access the image from the storage account. The user must have theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole on the storage account that you use for the image. For more information, seeAssign Azure rolesfor access to blob data.
Resolution:
Add theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the user that needs to create an image from this storage account. Once role has been added, retry deploying the image.
You may also see the following error when trying to deploy a VM image from a storage account:
Error:{"code":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=InvalidBlobType) =====\nDescription=The blob type is invalid for this operation.\nRequestId:5e74055f-e01e-0033-66eb-ff9734000000\nTime:2024-09-05T23:32:56.3001852Z, Details: (none)\n","message":"moc-operator galleryimage serviceClient returned an error while reconciling: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = ===== RESPONSE ERROR (ErrorCode=InvalidBlobType) =====\nDescription=The blob type is invalid for this operation.\nRequestId:5e74055f-e01e-0033-66eb-ff9734000000\nTime:2024-09-05T23:32:56.3001852Z, Details: (none)\n","additionalInfo":[{"type":"ErrorInfo","info":{"category":"Uncategorized","recommendedAction":"","troubleshootingURL":""}}]}

This failure is because the blob type is not correct within the storage account. The image must be ofpage blobtype.
page blob
Resolution:
Upload the image into your storage account inpage blob formatand retry deploying the image.
page blob format
Ensure that the user has the right permissions, and the blob is in the correct format. For more information, seeAdd VM image from Azure Storage account.
Failure to deploy an Azure Local VM
You see the following error when trying to deploy an Azure Local VM:
Error:{"code":"ConflictingOperation","message":"Unable to process request 'Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/virtualMachineInstances'. There is already a previous running operation for resource '/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<VM name>/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/virtualMachineInstances/default'. Please wait for the previous operation to complete."}
{"code":"ConflictingOperation","message":"Unable to process request 'Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/virtualMachineInstances'. There is already a previous running operation for resource '/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/<VM name>/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/virtualMachineInstances/default'. Please wait for the previous operation to complete."}
This failure is because theSystemAssignedmanaged identity object isn't under theMicrosoft.HybridCompute/machinesresource type.
SystemAssigned
Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines
Resolution:
Verify in your deployment template that:
TheSystemAssignedmanaged identity object is underMicrosoft.HybridCompute/machinesresource type and not underMicrosoft.AzureStackHCI/VirtualMachineInstancesresource type.
SystemAssigned
Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines
Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/VirtualMachineInstances
The deployment template should match the provided sample template. For more information, see the sample template inCreate Azure Local virtual machines enabled by Azure Arc.
Azure CLI installation isn't recognized
If your environment fails to recognize Azure CLI after installing it, run the following code block to add the Azure CLI installation path to the environment path.
if ( -not( $env:PATH -like '*C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin*') ) {
            $env:PATH += "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin;"
            Write-Host "Updated path $env:PATH"
        }
if ( -not( $env:PATH -like '*C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin*') ) {
            $env:PATH += "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin;"
            Write-Host "Updated path $env:PATH"
        }
