Applies to:Azure Logic Apps (Consumption + Standard)
Although Azure Logic Apps offers 1,400+ connectors
that you can use in logic app workflows, you might want to call APIs,
systems, and services that aren't available as connectors.
You can create your own APIs that provide actions and triggers to use in workflows.
Here are other reasons why you might want to create your own APIs
that you can call from workflows:
Extend your current system integration and data integration workflows.
Help customers use your service to manage professional or personal tasks.
Expand the reach, discoverability, and use for your service.
Basically, connectors are web APIs that use REST for pluggable interfaces,OpenAPI metadata formatfor documentation,
and JSON as their data exchange format. Because connectors are REST APIs
that communicate through HTTP endpoints, you can use any language to build connectors,
such as .NET, Java, Python, or Node.js.
You can also host your APIs onAzure App Service,
a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that provides one of the best, easiest,
and most scalable ways for API hosting.
For custom APIs to work with logic app workflow, your API can provideactionsthat perform specific tasks in workflows. Your API can also act as atriggerthat starts a workflow run when new data or an event meets a specified condition.
This topic describes common patterns that you can follow
for building actions and triggers in your API,
based on the behavior that you want your API to provide.

Tip
Although you can deploy your APIs as web apps,
consider deploying your APIs as API apps,
which can make your job easier when you build, host, and consume APIs
in the cloud and on premises. You don't have to change any code in your
APIs--just deploy your code to an API app. For example, learn how to
build API apps created with these languages:
ASP.NET.
Java
Node.js
PHP
Python
How do custom APIs differ from custom connectors?
Custom APIs andcustom connectorsare web APIs that use REST for pluggable interfaces,OpenAPI metadata formatfor documentation,
and JSON as their data exchange format. And because these APIs and connectors
are REST APIs that communicate through HTTP endpoints, you can use any language,
like .NET, Java, Python, or Node.js, for building custom APIs and connectors.
Custom APIs let you call APIs that aren't connectors,
and provide endpoints that you can call with HTTP + Swagger,
Azure API Management, or App Services. Custom connectors work
like custom APIs but also have these attributes:
Registered as Logic Apps Connector resources in Azure.
Appear with icons alongside Microsoft-managed connectors in the Logic Apps Designer.
Available only to the connectors' authors and logic app resource users who have the same
Microsoft Entra tenant and Azure subscription in the region where the
logic apps are deployed.
You can also nominate registered connectors for Microsoft certification.
This process verifies that registered connectors meet the criteria for public use
and makes those connectors available for users in Power Automate and Microsoft Power Apps.

Helpful tools
A custom API works best with logic apps when the API also has aOpenAPI documentthat describes the API's operations and parameters.
Many libraries, likeSwashbuckle,
can automatically generate the Swagger file for you.
To annotate the Swagger file for display names, property types, and so on,
you can also useTRexso that your Swagger file works well with logic apps.

Action patterns
For logic apps to perform tasks, your custom API should provideactions.
Each operation in your API maps to an action. A basic action is a
controller that accepts HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses.
So for example, a workflow sends an HTTP request to your web app or API app.
Your app then returns an HTTP response, along with content that the workflow can process.
For a standard action, you can write an HTTP request method in your API and
describe that method in a Swagger file. You can then call your API directly
with anHTTP actionor anHTTP + Swaggeraction.
By default, responses must be returned within therequest timeout limit.

To make a workflow wait while your API finishes longer-running tasks,
your API can follow theasynchronous polling patternor theasynchronous webhook patterndescribed in this topic.
For an analogy that helps you visualize these patterns' different behaviors,
imagine the process for ordering a custom cake from a bakery.
The polling pattern mirrors the behavior where you call the
bakery every 20 minutes to check whether the cake is ready.
The webhook pattern mirrors the behavior where the bakery asks you
for your phone number so they can call you when the cake is ready.

Perform long-running tasks with the polling action pattern
To have your API perform tasks that could run longer than therequest timeout limit,
you can use the asynchronous polling pattern. This pattern has
your API do work in a separate thread,
but keep an active connection to the Azure Logic Apps engine.
That way, the workflow doesn't time out or continue with
the next step in the workflow before your API finishes working.
Here's the general pattern:
Make sure that the engine knows that your API accepted the request and started working.
When the engine makes subsequent requests for job status, let the engine know when your API finishes the task.
Return relevant data to the engine so that the workflow can continue.
Now apply the previous bakery analogy to the polling pattern,
and imagine that you call a bakery and order a custom cake for delivery.
The process for making the cake takes time,
and you don't want to wait on the phone while the bakery works on the cake.
The bakery confirms your order and has you call every 20 minutes for the cake's status.
After 20 minutes pass, you call the bakery, but they tell you that your cake isn't
done and that you should call in another 20 minutes.
This back-and-forth process continues until you call,
and the bakery tells you that your order is ready and delivers your cake.
So let's map this polling pattern back. The bakery represents your custom API,
while you, the cake customer, represent the Azure Logic Apps engine.
When the engine calls your API with a request, your API confirms the request
and responds with the time interval when the engine can check job status.
The engine continues checking job status until your API responds
that the job is done and returns data to your logic app,
which then continues workflow.

Here are the specific steps for your API to follow,
described from the API's perspective:
When your API gets an HTTP request to start work,
immediately return an HTTP202 ACCEPTEDresponse with thelocationheader described later in this step.
This response lets the Azure Logic Apps engine know that your API got the request,
accepted the request payload (data input), and is now processing.The202 ACCEPTEDresponse should include these headers:Required: Alocationheader that specifies the absolute path
to a URL where the Azure Logic Apps engine can check your API's job statusOptional: Aretry-afterheader that specifies the number of seconds
that the engine should wait before checking thelocationURL for job status.By default, the engine polls thelocationURL after one second. To specify a different interval,
include theretry-afterheader and the number of seconds until the next poll.

immediately return an HTTP202 ACCEPTEDresponse with thelocationheader described later in this step.

location
retry-after
After the specified time passes, the Azure Logic Apps engine polls
thelocationURL to check job status. Your API should perform these
checks and return these responses:If the job is done, return an HTTP200 OKresponse,
along with the response payload (input for the next step).If the job is still processing, return another HTTP202 ACCEPTEDresponse,
but with the same headers as the original response.
After the specified time passes, the Azure Logic Apps engine polls
thelocationURL to check job status. Your API should perform these
checks and return these responses:
location
If the job is done, return an HTTP200 OKresponse,
along with the response payload (input for the next step).
If the job is done, return an HTTP200 OKresponse,
along with the response payload (input for the next step).
200 OK
If the job is still processing, return another HTTP202 ACCEPTEDresponse,
but with the same headers as the original response.
If the job is still processing, return another HTTP202 ACCEPTEDresponse,
but with the same headers as the original response.
202 ACCEPTED
When your API follows this pattern, you don't have to do anything in the
workflow definition to continue checking job status.
When the engine gets an HTTP202 ACCEPTEDresponse and a
validlocationheader, the engine respects the asynchronous pattern,
and checks thelocationheader until your API returns a non-202 response.

Tip
For an example asynchronous pattern, review thisasynchronous controller response sample in GitHub.

Perform long-running tasks with the webhook action pattern
As an alternative, you can use the webhook pattern
for long-running tasks and asynchronous processing.
This pattern pauses the workflow and waits for a "callback"
from your API to finish processing before continuing workflow.
This callback is an HTTP POST that sends a message to a URL when an event happens.
Now apply the previous bakery analogy to the webhook pattern,
and imagine that you call a bakery and order a custom cake for delivery.
The process for making the cake takes time,
and you don't want to wait on the phone while the bakery works on the cake.
The bakery confirms your order, but this time,
you give them your phone number so they can call you when the cake is done.
This time, the bakery tells you when your order is ready and delivers your cake.
When we map this webhook pattern back, the bakery represents your custom API,
while you, the cake customer, represent the Azure Logic Apps engine.
The engine calls your API with a request and includes a "callback" URL.
When the job is done, your API uses the URL to notify the engine
and return data to your logic app, which then continues workflow.
For this pattern, set up two endpoints on your controller:subscribeandunsubscribe
subscribe
unsubscribe
subscribeendpoint: When execution reaches your API's action in the workflow,
the Azure Logic Apps engine calls thesubscribeendpoint. This step causes the
workflow to create a callback URL that your API stores and then wait for the
callback from your API when work is complete. Your API then calls back
with an HTTP POST to the URL and passes any returned content and
headers as input to the logic app.

Currently, the workflow designer doesn't support discovering webhook endpoints through Swagger. So for this pattern, you have to add aWebhookactionand specify the URL, headers, and body for your request. See alsoWorkflow actions and triggers. For an example webhook pattern, review thiswebhook trigger sample in GitHub.
Here are some other tips and notes:
To pass in the callback URL, you can use the@listCallbackUrl()workflow function in any of the previous fields as necessary.

@listCallbackUrl()
If you own both the logic app resource and the subscribed service, you don't have to call theunsubscribeendpoint after the callback URL is called. Otherwise, the Azure Logic Apps runtime needs to call theunsubscribeendpoint to signal that no more calls are expected and to allow resource cleanup on the server side.

Trigger patterns
Your custom API can act as atriggerthat starts a workflow run when new data or an event meets a specified condition.
This trigger can either check regularly, or wait and listen,
for new data or events at your service endpoint.
If new data or an event meets the specified condition,
the trigger fires and starts the logic app, which is listening to that trigger.
To start logic apps this way, your API can follow thepolling triggeror thewebhook triggerpattern.
These patterns are similar to their counterparts forpolling actionsandwebhook actions.
Also, learn more aboutusage metering for triggers.

Check for new data or events regularly with the polling trigger pattern
Apolling triggeracts much like thepolling actionpreviously described in this topic. The Azure Logic Apps engine periodically
calls and checks the trigger endpoint for new data or events.
If the engine finds new data or an event that meets your specified condition,
the trigger fires. Then, the engine creates a workflow instance that processes the data as input.

Note
Each polling request counts as an action execution, even when no workflow instance is created.
To prevent processing the same data multiple times,
your trigger should clean up data that was already read and passed to the logic app.
Here are specific steps for a polling trigger, described from the API's perspective:
200 OK
202 ACCEPTED
location
retry-after
location
triggerState
For example, to periodically check your service for new files,
you might build a polling trigger that has these behaviors:

202 ACCEPTED
location

retry-after
DateTime

200 OK

Wait and listen for new data or events with the webhook trigger pattern
A webhook trigger is apush triggerthat waits and listens for new data or
events at your service endpoint. If new data or an event meets the specified condition,
the trigger fires and creates a workflow instance, which then processes the data as input.
Webhook triggers act much like thewebhook actionspreviously
described in this topic, and are set up withsubscribeandunsubscribeendpoints.
subscribe
unsubscribe
subscribeendpoint: When you add and save a webhook trigger in your logic app,
the Azure Logic Apps engine calls thesubscribeendpoint. This step causes
the workflow to create a callback URL that your API stores.
When there's new data or an event that meets the specified condition,
your API calls back with an HTTP POST to the URL.
The content payload and headers pass as input to the logic app.
