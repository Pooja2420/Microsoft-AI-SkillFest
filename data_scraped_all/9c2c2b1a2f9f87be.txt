The Manage phase of a cloud adoption journey focuses on the ongoing operation of your cloud estate. Maintaining and strengthening your security posture continuously is critical to successfully managing your estate and should be considered the cornerstone of your management practices. If you neglect security in favor of cost savings or performance improvements, you risk exposing your business to threats that could severely damage your business and reverse any short-term benefits that doing so brought. Investing in security mechanisms and practices sets your business up for long-term success by minimizing the risks of detrimental attacks.

This article is a supporting guide to theManagemethodology. It describes areas of security optimization that you should  consider as you move through that phase in your journey.
Security posture modernization
During the Manage phase of your cloud adoption journey, you should have a robustobservability platformwith thorough monitoring and intelligent alerting set up already, but modernizing this platform might require a new mindset that focuses heavily on proactive measures and adopting the principles of Zero Trust.
Assume breach:Assuming that there's a breach in one or more of your systems is a key tenet of proactive detection and the driver of threat hunting and detection engineering.Threat huntinguses a hypothesis-based approach - that a breach has already happened in some particular form - to intelligently analyze your systems through tooling in an attempt to prove or disprove that hypothesis.Detection engineeringis the practice of developing specialized detection mechanisms to augment observability platforms that aren't equipped to detect new and novel cyberattacks.

Verify explicitly:Moving from a mindset of "trust by default" to "trust by exception" means that you need to be able to validate trusted activities through visibility. Augmenting your observability platform with intelligent identity and access monitoring can help you detect anomalous behavior in real time.

Incident response planning:Modernizing your observability platform is essential for incident detection. It's also the foundation for maintaining your incident response plan. Your incident response plan must be a living document that's updated regularly. It needs to stay up to date with your threat hunting and detection engineering efforts and with publicly available risk information like theMITRE ATT&CKknowledge base.In addition to maintaining your incident response plans, you also need to have fully developed incident response and disaster recovery plans.

Managing confidentiality
The ongoing management of your security posture as it relates to confidentiality involves regularly performing well-designed monitoring and auditing practices, maintaining codified audit procedures, and looking for continuous improvement opportunities.
Regular monitoring and auditing:To ensure the integrity of confidentiality policies, you need to establish a regular cadence for both monitoring and auditing. Continuous monitoring helps with the early detection of potential security threats and anomalies. However, monitoring alone is insufficient. You need to conduct regular audits to verify that the policies and controls in place are effective and that they're being adhered to. Audits provide a comprehensive review of your security posture and help you identify any gaps or weaknesses that you need to address.

Audits provide a comprehensive review of your security posture and help you identify any gaps or weaknesses that you need to address.
Documenting and institutionalizing audit procedures:Documenting audit procedures is crucial for consistency and accountability. Institutionalizing these procedures ensures that audits are conducted systematically and regularly. Detailed documentation should include the scope of the audit, methodologies, tools used, and the frequency of audits. This practice helps you maintain a high standard of security. It also provides a clear trail for compliance and regulatory purposes.

Best practices for enhancing confidentiality include:Separation of duties (SoD):Implementing SoD helps prevent conflicts of interest and reduces the risk of fraud. Dividing responsibilities among different individuals ensures that no single person has control over all aspects of a critical process.Proactive user lifecycle maintenance:You need to regularly update and manage user accounts. This practice includes promptly revoking access for users who no longer need it, updating permissions as roles change, and ensuring that inactive accounts are disabled. Proactive maintenance helps prevent unauthorized access and helps ensure that only current, authorized users have access to sensitive data. The Access Architects should include these measures in their standard operating procedures.

Simulation exercises:Conduct regular security drills and simulations to prepare the team for real-world scenarios. These exercises should evaluate the organization's ability to respond to incidents within the Zero Trust framework, treating all network segments as potentially compromised until they're verified as secure. Scenarios such as phishing attacks, data breaches, and ransomware should be simulated to identify gaps in response strategies and provide hands-on experience with handling incidents. Drills should emphasize containment strategies by quickly isolating compromised systems to prevent further spread, rapid communication through the establishment of clear and efficient channels for disseminating information, and evidence preservation by ensuring that all relevant data is securely collected and stored to support subsequent analysis and investigation. Use preplanned responses like incident playbooks and communication protocols to ensure that actions during these drills are consistent and systematic.
