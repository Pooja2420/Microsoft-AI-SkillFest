This how-to guide shows how to access yourSSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)server from a workflow in Azure Logic Apps. SFTP is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream and uses theSecure Shell (SSH)protocol.
In Consumption logic app workflows, you can use theSFTP-SSHmanagedconnector, while in Standard logic app workflows, you can use theSFTPbuilt-in connector or theSFTP-SSHmanaged connector. You can use these connector operations to create automated workflows that run when triggered by events in your SFTP server or in other systems and run actions to manage files on your SFTP server. Both the managed and built-in connectors use the SSH protocol.
Note
TheSFTPmanagedconnectorhas been deprecated, so this connector's operations no longer appear in the workflow designer.
For example, your workflow can start with an SFTP trigger that monitors and responds to events on your SFTP server. The trigger makes the outputs available to subsequent actions in your workflow. Your workflow can run SFTP actions that get, create, and manage files through your SFTP server account. The following list includes more example tasks:
Monitor when files are added or changed.
Get, create, copy, rename, update, list, and delete files.
Create folders.
Get file content and metadata.
Extract archives to folders.
The following steps use the Azure portal, but with the appropriate Azure Logic Apps extension, you can also use the following tools to build logic app workflows:
Consumption workflows:Visual Studio Code
Standard workflows:Visual Studio Code
Connector technical reference
The SFTP connector has different versions, based onlogic app type and host environment.

Known issues
By default, triggers that return an array have aSplit Onsetting that's already enabled. With this setting enabled, the trigger automaticallydebatchesthe array by internally creating a separate workflow instance to process each array item. All the workflow instances run in parallel so that the array items are processed at the same time.
However, when theSplit Onsetting is enabled,managedconnector triggers return the outputs for all the array items as lists. Any subsequent actions that reference these outputs have to first handle these outputs as lists. To handle each array item individually, you can add extra actions. For example, to iterate through these array items, you can use aFor eachloop. For triggers that return only metadata or properties, use an action that gets the array item's metadata first, and then use an action to get the items contents.
You have to apply this approach only formanagedconnector triggers, not built-in connector triggers that return outputs for one array item at a time when theSplit Onsetting is enabled.
For example, suppose you have managed connector trigger namedWhen a file is added or modified (properties only)that returns the metadata or properties for the new or updated files as arrays. To get the metadata separately for each file, you might use aFor eachloop that iterates through the array. In this loop, use the following managed connector actions in the specified order:
Get file metadatato get each file's metadata.
Get file metadatato get each file's metadata.
Get file contentaction to get each file's content.
Get file contentaction to get each file's content.

When you save your workflow, this step automatically publishes your updates to your deployed logic app, which is live in Azure. With only a trigger, your workflow just checks the FTP server based on your specified schedule. You have toadd an actionthat responds to the trigger and does something with the trigger outputs.
For example, the trigger namedWhen a file is added or modifiedstarts a workflow when a file is added or changed on an SFTP server. As a subsequent action, you can add a condition that checks whether the file content meets your specified criteria. If the content meets the condition, use the action namedGet file contentto get the file content, and then use another action to put that file content into a different folder on the SFTP server.

Add an SFTP action
Before you can use an SFTP action, your workflow must already start with a trigger, which can be any kind that you choose. For example, you can use the genericRecurrencebuilt-in trigger to start your workflow on specific schedule.
