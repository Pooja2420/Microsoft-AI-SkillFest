One popular goal of cloud governance is restricting what resource types are allowed in the environment. Businesses have many motivations behind resource type restrictions. For example, resource types might be costly or might go against business standards and strategies. Rather than using many policies for individual resource types, Azure Policy offers two built-in policies to achieve this goal:
In this tutorial, you apply theNot allowed resource typespolicy and manage resource types at scale through Microsoft Azure portal.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Assign the policy definition
The first step in disabling resource types is to assign theNot allowed resource typespolicy definition.
Go toNot allowed resource typesin Azure portal.
Go toNot allowed resource typesin Azure portal.

Select theAssignbutton on the top of the page.
Select theAssignbutton on the top of the page.
On theBasicstab, set theScopeby selecting the ellipsis
and choosing a management group, subscription, or resource group. Ensure that the selectedscopehas at least one subscope. Then clickSelectat the bottom of theScopepage.This example uses theContososubscription.NoteIf you assign this policy definition to your root management group scope, the portal can detect disallowed resource types and disable them in theAll Servicesview so that portal users are aware of the restriction before trying to deploy a disallowed resource.

TheAssignment nameis automatically populated with the policy definition name you selected, but you can
change it. You can
also add an optionalDescriptionto provide details about this policy
assignment.

View disabled resource types in Azure portal
This step only applies when the policy was assigned at the root management group scope.
Now that you assigned a built-in policy definition, go toAll Services. Azure portal is aware of the disallowed resource types from this policy assignment and disables them in theAll Servicespage. TheCreateoption is unavailable for disabled resource types.
Note
If you assign this policy definition to your root management group, users will see the following notification when they sign in for the first time or if the policy changes after they have signed in:
Policy changed by adminYour administrator has made changes to the policies for your account. It is recommended that you refresh the portal to use the updated policies.

Create an exemption
Now suppose that one subscope should be allowed to have the resource types disabled by this policy. Let's create an exemption on this scope so that otherwise restricted resources can be deployed there.
Warning
If you assign this policy definition to your root management group scope, Azure portal is unable to detect exemptions at lower level scopes. Resources disallowed by the policy assignment will show as disabled from theAll Serviceslist and theCreateoption is unavailable. But you can create resources in the exempted scope with clients like Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager templates.
SelectAssignmentsunderAuthoringin the left side of the Azure Policy page.

Fill outExemption namewith the desired text, and leaveExemption categoryas the default ofWaiver. Don't switch the toggle forExemption expiration setting, because this exemption won't be set to expire. Optionally add anExemption description, and selectReview + create.

Clean up resources
If you're done working with resources from this tutorial, use the following steps to delete any of
the policy assignments or definitions created in this tutorial:

Review
In this tutorial, you successfully accomplished the following tasks:
Assigned theNot allowed resource typesbuilt-in policy to deny creation of disallowed resource types
Created an exemption for this policy assignment at a subscope
With this built-in policy you specified resource types thataren't allowed. The alternative, more restrictive approach is to specify resource types thatare allowedusing theAllowed resource typesbuilt-in policy.
Note
Azure portal'sAll Serviceswill only disable resources not specified in the allowed resource type policy if themodeis set toAlland the policy is assigned at the root management group. This is because it checks all resource types regardless oftagsandlocations. If you want the portal to have this behavior, duplicate theAllowed resource typesbuilt-in policy and change itsmodefromIndexedtoAll, then assign it to the root management group scope.
