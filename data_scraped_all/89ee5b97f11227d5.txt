Applies to this Azure Well-Architected Framework Performance Efficiency checklist recommendation:
This guide describes the recommendations for selecting appropriate services for your workload. The following recommendations help you choose services that best meet the requirements and demands of your workload. When you use services that are designed to handle your workload's requirements, you can ensure that your workload meets your performance targets. If you choose inappropriate services for your workload, the services might not be capable of handling your workload's demands. Insufficient services can lead to slow response times, bottlenecks, or workload failures.

Key design strategies
The services you choose should align with your workload's performance targets and be adaptable to future capacity needs. As the workload expands or evolves, the services you use should match your performance standards without requiring major adjustments. Consider the balance between platform features and custom implementations. Platform features provide immediate solutions, but custom-built options offer precise tailoring. Your service selections should be both forward-thinking and tailored to your specific needs, taking into account the trade-offs between convenience and customization.
Understand workload requirements
Understanding workload requirements refers to grasping the technical and functional demands of a workload. This analysis helps determine the resources, storage, compute, network, and other specifications needed to run the workload. Aligning services with the specific needs of a workload helps prevent overprovisioning or underutilizing resources.
Evaluate the needs and characteristics of your workload to determine the requirements, and align your workload requirements to your performance targets at every tier. You must account for constraints or dependencies. When you understand your workload requirements, you can make informed decisions. You can determine the right infrastructure and implement strategies to handle peak loads or variations in demand.
Meet performance targets.Select services that enable you to meet the performance targets for your workload. Ensure that a service can support the performance needs and that you can monitor its performance. Collect performance data for critical components.

Consider team skills.Your team builds and maintains workloads. Different services require different skills. Choose services that your team knows how to use, or commit to training them before you choose a service. Ensure that team members possess the expertise and knowledge to effectively use services and to optimize their performance.

Tradeoff: Specialized services offer specific functionalities but might limit customization. Flexible resources require more management and configuration compared to specialized services. Managed services offer ease of management, but you might have less control over the underlying infrastructure compared to self-managed resources.
Understand services
Understanding services is about knowing the capabilities, limits, and functionalities of a vendor's tools and offerings. An understanding of services helps you use built-in features, reducing the need for complex custom solutions and improving performance efficiency.
Consider various factors and gain a comprehensive understanding of a service before you choose it. Research and assess services and tools that the provider offers. Determine which services and tools best align with your workload requirements. Consider factors like managed services, serverless options, and specialized services.
Service limits are the predefined thresholds or boundaries that service providers set. Service limits define the maximum usage of resources or capabilities within that service. When you're familiar with service limits, you can avoid issues such as resource contention, performance degradation, or unexpected service interruptions. You can plan and scale the infrastructure appropriately. Your planning takes into account factors such as data volume, processing capacity, and data residency requirements.
Preferring platform features is about using built-in functionalities provided by a provider to handle specific tasks without custom code. Vendors design platform features to handle specific tasks efficiently at scale, and they regularly maintain these features. Platform features allow you to better take advantage of cloud infrastructure capabilities. Choose services that allow you to offload functionality to the platform instead of writing and maintaining your own custom code. In many cases, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions provide better performance efficiency than custom code. Custom code adds complexity and makes the workload prone to performance issues. Only develop custom code when service features aren't sufficient.
Tradeoff: The best service for your workload might be a technology that your team isn't skilled at, can't afford, or it might require extra security layers. For example, a public load balancer might fit your performance needs. But if you don't have a web application firewall, you might have to deploy a firewall to secure the workload.
Evaluate infrastructure requirements
The performance efficiency of resources is tied to the infrastructure they reside on. It makes the selection of the right infrastructure critical to service performance efficiency. Evaluating infrastructure requirements means to identify the geographical region and availability zones best suited to support your workload. Key considerations in this decision-making include:
Understand regions and availability zones.Every region corresponds to a distinct geographic location. Availability zones represent individual physical datacenters within a given region.

Single-region vs. multiple-region deployment model. A single-region deployment model deploys all resources in a single region. A multiple-region deployment model deploys resources across multiple regions. A multiple-region deployment can reduce latency to end users and mitigate capacity constraints. However, it can also increase the cost and complexity of the workload. Choose the deployment model that best suits your workload needs.

Consider latency.Latency, the time data takes to travel from source to destination, increases the further services are from each other. Services communicating across regions or availability zones can face increased latency. Identifying services that frequently communicate and positioning them within the same region is recommended. Additionally, selecting a region proximate to your primary user base can minimize latency, offering a better user experience.

Understand datacenter mapping.Availability zones might not map consistently to the same datacenters across different subscriptions. For instance, 'Zone 1' in 'Subscription A' might be different from 'Zone 1' in 'Subscription B'. When operating with multiple subscriptions, you should know these mappings to select zones that bolster performance optimally.

Tradeoff: Private virtual networking limits public access and makes it difficult to deploy and manage resources.
Evaluate compute requirements
Evaluating compute requirements involves assessing the specific compute needs of a workload, including factors such as instance type, scalability, and containerization. Different compute services have varying capabilities and characteristics that can affect the performance of your workload. Select the optimal compute service to ensure that your workload runs efficiently. Consider the following strategies:
Understand instance types.Different instance types are optimized for different workloads, such as CPU-optimized, memory-optimized, and GPU instances. Choose the instance type that aligns with your needs.

Consider containerization.Containers provide performance advantages compared to a noncontainerized workload. Consider using containerization if it suits your architectural needs. Containers improve compute performance through isolation, resource efficiency, fast startup time, and portability.When you use containers, consider design factors such as containerizing all application components. Use Linux-based container runtimes for lightweight images. Give containers short lifecycles to make them immutable and replaceable. Gather relevant logs and metrics from containers, container hosts, and the underlying cluster. Use this data to monitor and analyze performance. Containers are just one component of an overall architecture. Choose an appropriate container orchestrator, like Kubernetes, to further enhance performance and scalability.Container benefitDescriptionIsolationContainers provide isolated environments for applications. Containers ensure that application resources don't interfere with each other. This isolation ensures compute resources assigned to a container are dedicated to running a specific application, resulting in better performance.Resource efficiencyContainers are lightweight and share the host operating system's kernel, which allows for efficient resource utilization. Multiple containers can run on the same virtualized infrastructure, which maximizes the use of compute resources.Fast startup timeContainer images are prebuilt and are quickly started when needed. This fast startup time enables rapid scalability. It allows applications to scale up or down based on demand and avoid performance bottlenecks.PortabilityContainers encapsulate all the required dependencies and libraries within the image. With containers, it's easier to move applications across different operating systems or environments. This portability enables flexibility in deploying applications and allows for easy migration between cloud providers or on-premises environments.

Evaluate load balancing requirements
Load balancing ensures that network traffic is distributed evenly and prevents any single server from being overwhelmed with requests. Load balancing helps prevent bottlenecks and reduce response times. Evaluate the different load balancing services that your cloud provider offers. Review the cloud provider's documentation and comparison tools to understand the features. Select the most suitable service for your workload. To select a load balancing service, consider:
Understand traffic type: Determine whether the load balancing service needs to handle web traffic, like HTTP and HTTPS, or other protocols, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

Evaluate data store requirements
Evaluating data store requirements is about assessing the specific needs and conditions for storing, retrieving, and managing data. This assessment considers factors like data volume, access speed, consistency, and durability. A workload might require multiple types of data stores based on varying business and technical requirements. Identifying the right data store services and proper implementation helps prevent bottlenecks and ensures quick data access.
The database can affect factors such as data storage and retrieval, transaction processing, consistency guarantees, and handling of large or rapidly changing data. Assess the needs and criteria for your database. Select a database system that can meet those requirements. Evaluate the database requirements before you choose a database. To evaluate the database requirements and choose the appropriate database, follow these steps:
Identify the workload needs.Understand the specific requirements of your workload, such as data volume, expected transaction rates, concurrency, data types, and expected growth. Evaluate different database systems based on your workload needs. For example, if your workload requires high-performance real-time data processing, you might choose a database system optimized for fast data ingestion and low latency.

Consider the data model.Determine the data model that best suits your workload. Evaluate the database requirements to ensure that the chosen database supports the required data structures, relationships, and integrity constraints. For example, if your data has a highly relational structure, you might opt for a relational database management system (RDBMS) that provides robust support for transactions and referential integrity. The data model might be hierarchical, network, relational, object-oriented, or NoSQL. Assess the complexity of your data model. Ensure that the chosen database supports the required data structures and relationships.

Choose storage services that align with your data access patterns, durability requirements, and performance needs. Most cloud workloads use a combination of storage technologies. This technique is known as the polyglot persistence approach. Determine the appropriate combination of storage services for your workload. You might also want to separate data to avoid contamination. For example, you might have separate storage accounts for monitoring data and business data. Choosing the right mix and correct implementation is important for optimizing application performance.
Evaluate cache requirements
A cache stores frequently accessed data. Caching reduces data access latency and lowers the load on data storage components. It allows the workload to handle more requests without scaling. It's common to cache workload data and static content. A Redis cache can store session data, database results, API responses, and reference data, such as configuration settings. A content delivery network or static web app can cache and serve static content. Consider caching data to improve your workload performance. Choose the right caching option for your workload, preferring the platform caching services, such as Azure Redis Cache, over custom or self-hosted ones.
