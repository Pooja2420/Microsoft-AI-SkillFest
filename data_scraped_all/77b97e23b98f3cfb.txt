In this guide, you learnhow to migrateyour SAP Adapter Server Enterprise (ASE) databases to an Azure SQL database by usingSQL Server MigrationAssistant for SAP Adapter Server Enterprise.
For other migration guides, seeAzure Database Migration Guide.
Prerequisites
Before you begin migrating your SAP SE database to your SQL database, do the following:
Verify that your source environment is supported.
Download and installSQL Server Migration Assistant for SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (formerly SAP Sybase ASE).
Ensure that you have connectivity and sufficient permissions to access both source and target.
Pre-migration
After you've met the prerequisites, you're ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of yourAzure cloud migration.
Assess
By usingSQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (formally SAP Sybase ASE), you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate Sybase database objects to your SQL database, and then migrate data to the SQL database. To learn more, seeSQL Server Migration Assistant for Sybase (SybaseToSQL).
To create an assessment, do the following:
Open SSMA for Sybase.
Open SSMA for Sybase.
SelectFile, and then selectNew Project.
SelectFile, and then selectNew Project.
In theNew Projectpane, enter a name and location for your project and then, in theMigrate Todrop-down list, selectAzure SQL Database.

SelectOK.
SelectOK.
On theConnect to Sybasepane, enter the SAP connection details.

Right-click the SAP database you want to migrate, and then selectCreate report. This generates an HTML report. Alternatively, you can select theCreate reporttab at the upper right.

Review the HTML report to understand the conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of SAP ASE objects and the effort that's required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects. For example:drive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MySAPMigration\report\report_<date>

Validate the type mappings
Before you perform schema conversion, validate the default data-type mappings or change them based on requirements. You can do so by selectingTools>Project Settings, or you can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in theSAP ASE Metadata Explorer.
Convert the schema
To convert the schema, do the following:
(Optional) To convert dynamic or specialized queries, right-click the node, and then selectAdd statement.

Select theConnect to Azure SQL Databasetab, and then enter the details for your SQL database. You can choose to connect to an existing database or provide a new name, in which case a database will be created on the target server.

After the schema has been converted, compare and review the converted structure to the original structure identify potential problems.After the schema conversion, you can save this project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. To do so, selectFile>Save Project. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you publish the schema to your SQL database.

Migrate the databases
After you have the necessary prerequisites in place and have completed the tasks associated with thepre-migrationstage, you're ready to run the schema and data migration.
To publish the schema and migrate the data, do the following:
Publish the schema. On theAzure SQL Database Metadata Explorerpane, right-click the database, and then selectSynchronize with Database. This action publishes the SAP ASE schema to your SQL database.

Migrate the data. On theSAP ASE Metadata Explorerpane, right-click the SAP ASE database or object you want to migrate, and then selectMigrate Data. Alternatively, you can select theMigrate Datatab at the upper right.To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expandTables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box.

Post-migration
After you've successfully completed themigrationstage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
Remediate applications
After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this will in some cases require changes to the applications.
Perform tests
The test approach to database migration consists of the following activities:
Develop validation tests: To test the database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you've defined.

Set up a test environment: The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

Optimize
The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues, verifying completeness, and addressing performance issues with the workload.
For more information about these issues and the steps to mitigate them, see thePost-migration validation and optimization guide.
