In this article, you learn to secure Azure Machine Learning registry usingAzure Virtual Networkandprivate endpoints.
Private endpoints on Azure provide network isolation by enabling Azure services to be accessed through a private IP address within a virtual network (VNet). The VNet secures connections between Azure resources and prevent exposure of sensitive data to the public internet.
Using network isolation with private endpoints prevents the network traffic from going over the public internet and brings Azure Machine Learning registry service to your Virtual network. All the network traffic happens overAzure Private Linkwhen private endpoints are used.
Prerequisites
AnAzure Machine Learning registry. To create one, use the steps in theHow to create and manage registriesarticle.

Securing Azure Machine Learning registry
Note
For simplicity, this article refers to a workspace, associated resources, and the virtual network they're part of as secure workspace configuration. It explores how to add Azure Machine Learning registries as part of the existing configuration.
The following diagram shows a basic network configuration and how the Azure Machine Learning registry fits in. If you're already using Azure Machine Learning workspace and have a secure workspace configuration where all the resources are part of virtual network, you can create a private endpoint from the existing virtual network to Azure Machine Learning registry and associated resources (storage and ACR).
If you don't have a secure workspace configuration, you can create it using theCreate a secure workspace in Azure portalarticle,Bicep template, orTerraform template.

Limitations
If you use an Azure Machine Learning registry with network isolation, you can viewmodelassets in Azure Machine Learning studio. You aren't able to view other types of assets. You aren't able to perform any operations on Azure Machine Learning registry or assets under it using studio. Use the Azure Machine Learning CLI or SDK instead.
Scenario: workspace configuration is secure and Azure Machine Learning registry is public
This section describes the scenarios and required network configuration if you have a secure workspace configuration but using a public registry.
Create assets in registry from local files
The identity (for example, a Data Scientist's Microsoft Entra user identity) used to create assets in the registry must be assigned theAzureML Registry User,owner, orcontributorrole in Azure role-based access control. For more information, see theManage access to Azure Machine Learningarticle.
Share assets from workspace to registry
Note
Sharing a component from Azure Machine Learning workspace to Azure Machine Learning registry isn't supported currently.
Due to data exfiltration protection, it isn't possible to share an asset from secure workspace to a public registry if the storage account containing the asset has public access disabled. To enable asset sharing from workspace to registry:
Go to theNetworkingsection of the storage account attached to the workspace (from where you would like to allow sharing of assets to registry)
SetPublic network accesstoEnabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses
Scroll down and go toResource instancessection. SelectResource typetoMicrosoft.MachineLearningServices/registriesand setInstance nameto the name of Azure Machine Learning registry resource were you would like to enable sharing to from workspace.
Make sure to check rest of the settings as per your network configuration.
Use assets from registry in workspace
Example operations:
Submit a job that uses an asset from registry.
Use a component from registry in a pipeline.
Use an environment from registry in a component.
Using assets from registry to a secure workspace requires configuring outbound access to the registry.
Deploy a model from registry to workspace
To deploy a model from a registry to a secure managed online endpoint, the deployment must haveegress_public_network_access=disabledset. Azure Machine Learning creates the necessary private endpoints to the registry during endpoint deployment. For more information, seeCreate secure managed online endpoints.
egress_public_network_access=disabled

Scenario: workspace configuration is secure and Azure Machine Learning registry is connected to virtual networks using private endpoints
This section describes the scenarios and required network configuration if you have a secure workspace configuration with Azure Machine Learning registries connected using private endpoint to a virtual network.
Azure Machine Learning registry uses associated storage/ACR service instances. These service instances can also be connected to the VNet using private endpoints to secure the configuration. For more information, see theHow to create a private endpointsection.
How to find the Azure Storage Account and Azure Container Registry used by your registry
The storage account and ACR used by your Azure Machine Learning registry are created under a managed resource group in your Azure subscription. The name of the managed resource group follows the pattern ofazureml-rg-<name-of-your-registry>_<GUID>. The GUID is a randomly generated string. For example, if the name of your registry is "contosoreg," the name of the managed resource group would beazureml-rg-contosoreg_<GUID>.
azureml-rg-<name-of-your-registry>_<GUID>
azureml-rg-contosoreg_<GUID>
In the Azure portal, you can find this resource group by searching forazureml_rg-<name-of-your-registry>. All the storage and ACR resources for your registry are available under this resource group.
azureml_rg-<name-of-your-registry>
Create assets in registry from local files
Note
Creating an environment asset isn't supported in a private registry where associated ACR has public access disabled. As a workaround, you can create an environment in Azure Machine Learning workspace and share it to Azure Machine Learning registry.
Clients need to be connected to the VNet to which the registry is connected with a private endpoint.
Securely connect to your registry
To connect to a registry secured behind a VNet, use one of the following methods:
Azure VPN gatewayâ¯- Connects on-premises networks to the VNet over a private connection. Connection is made over the public internet. There are two types of VPN gateways that you might use:Point-to-site: Each client computer uses a VPN client to connect to the VNet.Site-to-site: A VPN device connects the VNet to your on-premises network.

ExpressRouteâ¯- Connects on-premises networks into the cloud over a private connection. Connection is made using a connectivity provider.

Azure Bastionâ¯- In this scenario, you create an Azure Virtual Machine (sometimes called a jump box) inside the VNet. You then connect to the VM using Azure Bastion. Bastion allows you to connect to the VM using either an RDP or SSH session from your local web browser. You then use the jump box as your development environment. Since it is inside the VNet, it can directly access the registry.

Data exfiltration protection
For a user created Azure Machine Learning registry, we recommend using a private endpoint for the registry, managed storage account, and managed ACR.
For a system registry, we recommend creating a Service Endpoint Policy for the Storage account using the/services/Azure/MachineLearningalias. For more information, seeConfigure data exfiltration prevention.
/services/Azure/MachineLearning
How to find the registry's fully qualified domain name
Note
Make sure your DNS is able to resolve the registry private FQDN which is in this format:<registry-guid>.registry.<region>.privatelink.api.azureml.msas there's no public resource specific FQDN  which is recursively resolved by Azure DNS.
<registry-guid>.registry.<region>.privatelink.api.azureml.ms
The following examples show how to use the discovery URL to get the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your registry. When calling the discovery URL, you must provide an Azure access token in the request header. The following examples show how to get an access token and call the discovery URL:
Tip
The format for the discovery URL ishttps://<region>.api.azureml.ms/registrymanagement/v1.0/registries/<registry_name>/discovery, where<region>is the region where your registry is located and<registry_name>is the name of your registry. To call the URL, make a GET request:
https://<region>.api.azureml.ms/registrymanagement/v1.0/registries/<registry_name>/discovery
<region>
<registry_name>
GET https://<region>.api.azureml.ms/registrymanagement/v1.0/registries/<registry_name>/discovery
GET https://<region>.api.azureml.ms/registrymanagement/v1.0/registries/<registry_name>/discovery
Azure PowerShell
$region = "<region>"
$registryName = "<registry_name>"
$accessToken = (az account get-access-token | ConvertFrom-Json).accessToken 
(Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get `
                   -Uri "https://$region.api.azureml.ms/registrymanagement/v1.0/registries/$registryName/discovery" `
                   -Headers @{ Authorization="Bearer $accessToken" }).registryFqdns
$region = "<region>"
$registryName = "<registry_name>"
$accessToken = (az account get-access-token | ConvertFrom-Json).accessToken 
(Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get `
                   -Uri "https://$region.api.azureml.ms/registrymanagement/v1.0/registries/$registryName/discovery" `
                   -Headers @{ Authorization="Bearer $accessToken" }).registryFqdns
