In this quickstart, you learn how to use Apache Zeppelin to runApache Hivequeries in Azure HDInsight. HDInsight Interactive Query clusters includeApache Zeppelinnotebooks that you can use to run interactive Hive queries.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An HDInsight Interactive Query cluster. SeeCreate clusterto create an HDInsight cluster.  Make sure to choose theInteractive Querycluster type.
Create an Apache Zeppelin Note
ReplaceCLUSTERNAMEwith the name of your cluster in the following URLhttps://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/zeppelin. Then enter the URL in a web browser.

Enter your cluster login username and password. From the Zeppelin page, you can either create a new note or open existing notes.HiveSamplecontains some sample Hive queries.

Enter the following Hive query in the code section, and then pressShift + Enter:%jdbc(hive)
show tablesThe%jdbc(hive)statement in the first line tells the notebook to use the Hive JDBC interpreter.The query shall return one Hive table calledhivesampletable.The following are two more Hive queries that you can run againsthivesampletable:%jdbc(hive)
select * from hivesampletable limit 10

%jdbc(hive)
select ${group_name}, count(*) as total_count
from hivesampletable
group by ${group_name=market,market|deviceplatform|devicemake}
limit ${total_count=10}Compared to the traditional Hive, the query results come back much faster.

More examples
Create a table. Execute the code in the Zeppelin Notebook:%jdbc(hive)
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE log4jLogs (
    t1 string,
    t2 string,
    t3 string,
    t4 string,
    t5 string,
    t6 string,
    t7 string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' '
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

Load data into the new table. Execute the code in the Zeppelin Notebook:%jdbc(hive)
LOAD DATA
INPATH 'wasbs:///example/data/sample.log'
INTO TABLE log4jLogs;
Load data into the new table. Execute the code in the Zeppelin Notebook:
%jdbc(hive)
LOAD DATA
INPATH 'wasbs:///example/data/sample.log'
INTO TABLE log4jLogs;
%jdbc(hive)
LOAD DATA
INPATH 'wasbs:///example/data/sample.log'
INTO TABLE log4jLogs;
Insert a single record. Execute the code in the Zeppelin Notebook:%jdbc(hive)
INSERT INTO TABLE log4jLogs2
VALUES ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G');
Insert a single record. Execute the code in the Zeppelin Notebook:
%jdbc(hive)
INSERT INTO TABLE log4jLogs2
VALUES ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G');
%jdbc(hive)
INSERT INTO TABLE log4jLogs2
VALUES ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G');
Review theHive language manualfor more syntax.
Clean up resources
After you complete the quickstart, you may want to delete the cluster. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it isn't in use. You're also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it isn't in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they aren't in use.
To delete a cluster, seeDelete an HDInsight cluster using your browser, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.
Next steps
In this quickstart, you learned how to use Apache Zeppelin to run Apache Hive queries in Azure HDInsight. To learn more about Hive queries, the next article will show you how to execute queries with Visual Studio.
