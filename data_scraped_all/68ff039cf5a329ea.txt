You can create SSH keys before creating a VM and store them in Azure. Each newly created SSH key is also stored locally.
If you have existing SSH keys, you can upload and store them in Azure for reuse.
For more information, seeDetailed steps: Create and manage SSH keys for authentication to a Linux VM in Azure.

Generate new keys
After you sign in, use theaz sshkey createcommand to create the new SSH key:az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"NoteThis command would default to key type of RSA, in order to generate ED25519 keys you can pass in the optional flag--encryption-type Ed25519.
After you sign in, use theaz sshkey createcommand to create the new SSH key:
az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
Note
This command would default to key type of RSA, in order to generate ED25519 keys you can pass in the optional flag--encryption-type Ed25519.
--encryption-type Ed25519
The resulting output lists the new key files' paths:Private key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999".
Public key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub".
The resulting output lists the new key files' paths:
Private key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999".
Public key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub".
Private key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999".
Public key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub".
Change the permissions for the private key file for privacy:chmod 600 /home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999
Change the permissions for the private key file for privacy:
chmod 600 /home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999
chmod 600 /home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999
Connect to the VM
On your local computer, open a Bash prompt:
ssh -i <path to the private key file> username@<ipaddress of the VM>
ssh -i <path to the private key file> username@<ipaddress of the VM>
For example, enter:ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/mySSHKey azureuser@123.45.67.890
ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/mySSHKey azureuser@123.45.67.890
Upload an SSH key
You can upload a public SSH key to store in Azure.
Use theaz sshkey createcommand to upload an SSH public key by specifying its file:
az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --public-key "@/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --public-key "@/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
List keys
Use theaz sshkey listcommand to list all public SSH keys, optionally specifying a resource group:
az sshkey list --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
az sshkey list --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
Get the public key
Use theaz sshkey showcommand to show the values of a public SSH key:
az sshkey show --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
az sshkey show --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
