There are various quotas and limits that apply to IoT Central applications. IoT Central applications internally use multiple Azure services such as IoT Hub and the Device Provisioning Service (DPS), and these services also have quotas and limits. Where relevant, quotas and limits in the underlying services are called out in this article.
Devices
Telemetry
Property updates
Commands
REST API calls
Storage
Data export
For large volumes of export data, you may experience up to 60 seconds of latency. Typically, the latency is much lower than this.
Device modeling
Device groups
Device provisioning
Rules
Jobs
Users, roles, and organizations
1IoT Central doesn't limit the amount of device-to-cloud, cloud-to-device, property, or command traffic. It has variable throttles based on the application's load profile. If your application starts sending more traffic, IoT Central autoscales to best suit the load profile. You might notice throttling messages for a short period of time until IoT Central completes the autoscale process.
Next steps
Now that you've learned about the quotas and limits that apply to Azure IoT Central, the suggested next step is to learn aboutAzure IoT Central architecture.
