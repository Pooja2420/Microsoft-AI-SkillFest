The Start/Stop VMs v2 feature starts or stops Azure Virtual Machines instances across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops virtual machines on user-defined schedules, provides insights throughAzure Application Insights, and send optional notifications by usingaction groups. For most scenarios, Start/Stop VMs can manage virtual machines deployed and managed both by Azure Resource Manager and by Azure Service Manager (classic), which isdeprecated.
This new version of Start/Stop VMs v2 provides a decentralized low-cost automation option for customers who want to optimize their VM costs. It offers all of the same functionality as the original version that was available with Azure Automation, but it's designed to take advantage of newer technology in Azure. The Start/Stop VMs v2 relies on multiple Azure services and it will be charged based on the services that are deployed and consumed.
Important Start/Stop VMs v2 Updates
No further development, enhancements, or updates will be available for Start/Stop v2 except when required to remain on supported versions of components and Azure services.

The TriggerAutoUpdate and UpdateStartStopV2 functions are now deprecated and will be removed in the future. To update Start/Stop v2, we recommend that you stop the site, install to the latest version from ourGitHub repository, and then start the site. To disable the automatic update functionality, set the Function App'sAzureClientOptions:EnableAutoUpdateapplication settingtofalse. No built-in notification system is available for updates. After an update to Start/Stop v2 becomes available, we will update thereadme.mdin the GitHub repository. Third-party GitHub file watchers might be available to notify you of changes.

As of August 19, 2024, Start/Stop v2 has been updated to the.NET 8 isolated worker model.

Overview
Start/Stop VMs v2 is redesigned and it doesn't depend on Azure Automation or Azure Monitor Logs, as required by the previous version. This version relies onAzure Functionsto handle the VM start and stop execution.
A managed identity is created in Microsoft Entra ID for this Azure Functions application and allows Start/Stop VMs v2 to easily access other Microsoft Entra protected resources, such as the logic apps and Azure VMs. For more about managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID, seeManaged identities for Azure resources.
An HTTP trigger function endpoint is created to support the schedule and sequence scenarios included with the feature, as shown in the following table.
For example,ScheduledHTTP trigger function is used to handle schedule and sequence scenarios. Similarly,AutoStopHTTP trigger function handles the auto stop scenario.
The queue-based trigger functions are required in support of this feature. All timer-based triggers are used to perform the availability test and to monitor the health of the system.
Azure Logic Appsis used to configure and manage the start and stop schedules for the VM take action by calling the function using a JSON payload. By default, during initial deployment it creates a total of five Logic Apps for the following scenarios:
Scheduled- Start and stop actions are based on a schedule you specify against Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs.ststv2_vms_Scheduled_startandststv2_vms_Scheduled_stopconfigure the scheduled start and stop.
Scheduled- Start and stop actions are based on a schedule you specify against Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs.ststv2_vms_Scheduled_startandststv2_vms_Scheduled_stopconfigure the scheduled start and stop.
Sequenced- Start and stop actions are based on a schedule targeting VMs with pre-defined sequencing tags. Only two named tags are supported -sequencestartandsequencestop.ststv2_vms_Sequenced_startandststv2_vms_Sequenced_stopconfigure the sequenced start and stop.The proper way to use the sequence functionality is to create a tag namedsequencestarton each VM you wish to be started in a sequence. The tag value needs to be an integer ranging from 1 to N for each VM in the respective scope. The tag is optional and if not present, the VM simply won't participate in the sequencing. The same criteria applies to stopping VMs with only the tag name being different and usesequencestopin this case. You have to configure both the tags in each VM to get start and stop action. If two or more VMs share the same tag value, those VMs would be started or stopped at the same time.For example, the following table shows that both start and stop actions are processed in ascending order by the value of the tag.NoteThis scenario only supports Azure Resource Manager VMs.

Note
This scenario only supports Azure Resource Manager VMs.
AutoStop- This functionality is only used for performing a stop action against both Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs based on its CPU utilization. It can also be a scheduled-basedtake action, which creates alerts on VMs and based on the condition, the alert is triggered to perform the stop action.ststv2_vms_AutoStopconfigures the auto stop functionality.

Each Start/Stop action supports assignment of one or more subscriptions, resource groups, or a list of VMs.
An Azure Storage account, which is required by Functions, is also used by Start/Stop VMs v2 for two purposes:
Uses Azure Table Storage to store the execution operation metadata (that is, the start/stop VM action).
Uses Azure Table Storage to store the execution operation metadata (that is, the start/stop VM action).
Uses Azure Queue Storage to support the Azure Functions queue-based triggers.

All trace logging data from the function app execution is sent to your connected Application Insights instance. You can view the telemetry data stored in Application Insights from a set of pre-defined visualizations presented in a sharedAzure dashboard.
Email notifications are also sent as a result of the actions performed on the VMs.
New releases
When a new version of Start/Stop VMs v2 is released, your instance is auto-updated without having to manually redeploy.
Supported scoping options
Subscription
Scoping to a subscription can be used when you need to perform the start and stop action on all the VMs in an entire subscription, and you can select multiple subscriptions if necessary.
You can also specify a list of VMs to exclude and it will ignore them from the action. You can also use wildcard characters to specify all the names that simultaneously can be ignored.
Resource group
Scoping to a resource group can be used when you need to perform the start and stop action on all the VMs by specifying one or more resource group names, and across one or more subscriptions.
You can also specify a list of VMs to exclude and it will ignore them from the action. You can also use wildcard characters to specify all the names that simultaneously can be ignored.
VMList
Specifying a list of VMs can be used when you need to perform the start and stop action on a specific set of virtual machines, and across multiple subscriptions. This option doesn't support specifying a list of VMs to exclude.
