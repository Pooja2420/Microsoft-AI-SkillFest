In this article, learn how to create and connect to a secure Azure Machine Learning workspace. The steps in this article use an Azure Machine Learning managed virtual network to create a security boundary around resources used by Azure Machine Learning.
In this tutorial, you accomplish the following tasks:
Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace configured to use a managed virtual network.
Create an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster. A compute cluster is used whentraining machine learning models in the cloud.
After completing this tutorial, you'll have the following architecture:
An Azure Machine Learning workspace that uses a private endpoint to communicate using the managed network.
An Azure Storage Account that uses private endpoints to allow storage services such as blob and file to communicate using the managed network.
An Azure Container Registry that uses a private endpoint communicate using the managed network.
An Azure Key Vault that uses a private endpoint to communicate using the managed network.
An Azure Machine Learning compute instance and compute cluster secured by the managed network.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try thefree or paid version of Azure Machine Learning.
Create a jump box (VM)
There are several ways that you can connect to the secured workspace. In this tutorial, ajump boxis used. A jump box is a virtual machine in an Azure Virtual Network. You can connect to it using your web browser and Azure Bastion.
The following table lists several other ways that you might connect to the secure workspace:
Important
When using aVPN gatewayorExpressRoute, you will need to plan how name resolution works between your on-premises resources and those in the cloud. For more information, seeUse a custom DNS server.
Use the following steps to create an Azure Virtual Machine to use as a jump box. From the VM desktop, you can then use the browser on the VM to connect to resources inside the managed virtual network, such as Azure Machine Learning studio. Or you can install development tools on the VM.
Tip
The following steps create a Windows 11 enterprise VM. Depending on your requirements, you might want to select a different VM image. The Windows 11 (or 10) enterprise image is useful if you need to join the VM to your organization's domain.
In theAzure portal, select the portal menu in the upper left corner. From the menu, select+ Create a resourceand then enterVirtual Machine. Select theVirtual Machineentry, and then selectCreate.

You can leave other fields at the default values.

SelectNetworking. Review the networking information and make sure that it's not using the 172.17.0.0/16 IP address range. If it is, select a different range such as 172.16.0.0/16; the 172.17.0.0/16 range can cause conflicts with Docker.NoteThe Azure Virtual Machine creates its own Azure Virtual Network for network isolation. This network is separate from the managed virtual network used by Azure Machine Learning.

Enable Azure Bastion for the VM
Azure Bastion enables you to connect to the VM desktop through your browser.
In the Azure portal, select the VM you created earlier. From theConnectsection of the page, selectBastionand thenDeploy Bastion.

Connect to the VM desktop
From theAzure portal, select the VM you created earlier.

Connect to studio
At this point, the workspace is createdbut the managed virtual network is not. The managed virtual network isconfiguredwhen you create the workspace. Tocreatethe managed virtual network, create a compute resource or manually provision the network.
Use the following steps to create a compute instance.
From theVM desktop, use the browser to open theAzure Machine Learning studioand select the workspace you created earlier.

From theConfigure required settingsdialog, enter a unique value as theCompute name. Leave the rest of the selections at the default value.

SelectCreate. The compute instance takes a few minutes to create. The compute instance is created within the managed network.TipIt may take several minutes to create the first compute resource. This delay occurs because the managed virtual network is also being created. The managed virtual network isn't created until the first compute resource is created. Subsequent managed compute resources will be created much faster.

Enable studio access to storage
Since the Azure Machine Learning studio partially runs in the web browser on the client, the client needs to be able to directly access the default storage account for the workspace to perform data operations. To enable direct access, use the following steps:
From theAzure portal, select the jump box VM you created earlier. From theOverviewsection, copy thePublic IP address.

From theAzure portal, select the workspace you created earlier. From theOverviewsection, select the link for theStorageentry.
From theAzure portal, select the workspace you created earlier. From theOverviewsection, select the link for theStorageentry.
From the storage account, selectNetworking, and add the jump box'spublicIP address to theFirewallsection.TipIn a scenario where you use a VPN gateway or ExpressRoute instead of a jump box, you could add a private endpoint or service endpoint for the storage account to the Azure Virtual Network. Using a private endpoint or service endpoint would allow multiple clients connecting through the Azure Virtual Network to successfully perform storage operations through studio.At this point, you can use the studio to interactively work with notebooks on the compute instance and run training jobs. For a tutorial, seeTutorial: Model development.

Stop compute instance
While it's running (started), the compute instance continues charging your subscription. To avoid excess cost,stopit when not in use.
From studio, selectCompute,Compute instances, and then select the compute instance. Finally, selectStopfrom the top of the page.

Clean up resources
If you plan to continue using the secured workspace and other resources, skip this section.
To delete all resources created in this tutorial, use the following steps:
In the Azure portal, selectResource groups.
In the Azure portal, selectResource groups.
From the list, select the resource group that you created in this tutorial.

SelectDelete resource group.
SelectDelete resource group.

Enter the resource group name, then selectDelete.
Enter the resource group name, then selectDelete.
