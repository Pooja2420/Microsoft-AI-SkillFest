This article describes roles and permissions required to share and receive data using Azure Data Share service.
Roles and requirements
With Azure Data Share service, you can share data without exchanging credentials between data provider and consumer. For snapshot-based sharing, Azure Data Share service uses Managed Identities (previously known as MSIs) to authenticate to Azure data store.
To create shares in Azure Data share, a user will need these permissions:
Data share account permissions:Contributor
Storage resource group:Reader(Read permissions on the resource group where your storage accounts or databases live you permission to browse for them in the portal.)
Source permissions, depending on the source:Storage and data lake sharingAzure SQL sharingAzure Synapse analytics sharing

SQL database sharing
To share data from SQL, you can use either:
Microsoft Entra authentication
SQL authentication
To receive data into SQL, you'll need toassign permissions to receive data.
These prerequisites cover the authentication you'll need so Azure Data Share can connect with your Azure SQL Database:
You'll need permission to write to the databases on SQL server:Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/write. This permission exists in theContributorrole.

Assign MI permissions manually
If a user hasMicrosoft.Authorization/role assignments/writepermissions on a source or target data store, it will automatically assign Azure Data Share's Managed identity the permissions it needs to authenticate with the data store. You can also assign managed identity permissions manually.
If you choose to assign permissions manually, assign these permissions to your Azure Data Share resource's managed identity based on source and action:
Data provider example
When you share data from a storage account, the data share resource's managed identity is granted theStorage Blob Data Readerrole.
This is done automatically by the Azure Data Share service when user is adding dataset via Azure portal and the user is an owner of the Azure data store, or is a member of a custom role that has theMicrosoft.Authorization/role assignments/writepermission assigned.
Alternatively, user can have the owner of the Azure data store add the data share resource's managed identity to the Azure data store manually. This action only needs to be performed once per data share resource.
To create a role assignment for the data share resource's managed identity manually, use the following steps:
Navigate to the Azure data store.
Navigate to the Azure data store.
SelectAccess control (IAM).
SelectAccess control (IAM).
SelectAdd > Add role assignment.
SelectAdd > Add role assignment.

On theReview + assigntab, selectReview + assignto assign the role.
To learn more about role assignments, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. If you're sharing data using REST APIs, you can create role assignment using API by referencingAssign Azure roles using the REST API.
For SQL snapshot-based sharing, a SQL user needs to be created from an external provider in SQL Database with the same name as the Azure Data Share resource while connecting to SQL database using Microsoft Entra authentication. This user needs to be granteddb_datareaderpermission. A sample script along with other prerequisites for SQL-based sharing can be found in theShare from Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analyticstutorial.
Data consumer example
To receive data into storage account, consumer data share resource's managed identity needs to be granted access to the target storage account. The data share resource's managed identity needs to be granted theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole. This is done automatically by the Azure Data Share service if the user specifies a target storage account via Azure portal and the user has proper permission. For example, user is an owner of the storage account, or is a member of a custom role that has theMicrosoft.Authorization/role assignments/writepermission assigned.
Alternatively, user can have owner of the storage account add the data share resource's managed identity to the storage account manually. This action only needs to be performed once per data share resource. To create a role assignment for the data share resource's managed identity manually, follow the below steps.
Navigate to the Azure data store.

For SQL-based target, a SQL user needs to be created from an external provider in SQL Database with the same name as the Azure Data Share resource while connecting to SQL database using Microsoft Entra authentication. This user needs to be granteddb_datareader, db_datawriter, db_ddladminpermission. A sample script along with other prerequisites for SQL-based sharing can be found in theShare from Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analyticstutorial.
Resource provider registration
You might need to manually register the Microsoft.DataShare resource provider into your Azure subscription in the following scenarios:
View Azure Data Share invitation for the first time in your Azure tenant
Share data from an Azure data store in a different Azure subscription from your Azure Data Share resource
Receive data into an Azure data store in a different Azure subscription from your Azure Data Share resource
Follow these steps to register the Microsoft.DataShare resource provider into your Azure Subscription. You needContributoraccess to the Azure subscription to register resource provider.
In the Azure portal, navigate toSubscriptions.
Select the subscription that you're using for Azure Data Share.
Select onResource Providers.
Search for Microsoft.DataShare.
SelectRegister.
To learn more about resource provider, refer toAzure resource providers and types.
Custom roles for Data Share
This section describes custom roles and permissions required within the custom roles for sharing and receiving data, specific to a Storage account. There are also prerequisites that are independent of custom role or Azure Data Share role.
Prerequisites for Data Share, in addition to custom role
For storage and data lake snapshot-based sharing, to add a dataset in Azure Data Share, the provider data share resource's managed identity needs to be granted access to the source Azure data store.  For example, if using a storage account, the data share resource's managed identity is granted the Storage Blob Data Reader role.
To receive data into a storage account, the consumer data share resource's managed identity needs to be granted access to the target storage account. The data share resource's managed identity needs to be granted the Storage Blob Data Contributor role.
You might also need to manually register the Microsoft.DataShare resource provider into your Azure subscription for some scenarios. See inResource provider registrationsection of this article for specific details.
Create custom roles and required permissions
Custom roles can be created in a subscription or resource group for sharing and receiving data. Users and groups can then be assigned the custom role.
For creating a custom role, there are actions required for Storage, Data Share, Resources group, and Authorization. See theAzure resource provider operations documentfor Data Share to understand the different levels of permissions and choose the ones relevant for your custom role.
Alternately, you can use the Azure portal to navigate to IAM, Custom role, Add permissions, Search, search for Microsoft.DataShare permissions to see the list of actions available.
To learn more about custom role assignment, refer toAzure custom roles. Once you have your custom role, test it to verify that it works as you expect.
The following shows an example of how the required actions will be listed in JSON view for a custom role to share and receive data.
