Cross-zone replicationenables you to replicate volumes across availability zones within the same region. It enables you to fail over your critical application if a region-wide outage or disaster happens.
For information about availability zones, seeUse availability zone volume placement for application high availability with Azure NetApp FilesandManage availability zone volume placement for Azure NetApp Files.
Requirements
Before you begin, you should review therequirements and considerations for cross-zone replication.
Create the source volume with an availability zone
This process requires that your account is subscribed to theavailability zone volume placement feature.

Create the data replication volume in another availability zone of the same region
Locate the volume source ID.
