Note
Count aggregation is not recommended for any of the NAT gateway metrics. Count aggregation adds up the number of metric values and not the metric values themselves. Use Total aggregation instead to get the best representation of data values for connection count, bytes, and packets metrics.
Use Average for best represented health data for the datapath availability metric.
For information about aggregation types, seeaggregation types.
