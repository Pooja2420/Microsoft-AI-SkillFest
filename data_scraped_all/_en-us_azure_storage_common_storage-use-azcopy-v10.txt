AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account. This article helps you download AzCopy, connect to your storage account, and then transfer data.
Note
AzCopyV10is the currently supported version of AzCopy. The tool is not supported on versions of Windows, Linux, or macOS that are no longer officially maintained.
If you need to use a previous version of AzCopy, see theUse the previous version of AzCopysection of this article.
This video shows you how to download and run the AzCopy utility.
The steps in the video are also described in the following sections.
Use cases for AzCopy
AzCopy can be used to copy your data to, from, or between Azure storage accounts. Common use cases include:
Copying data from an on-premises source to an Azure storage account
Copying data from an Azure storage account to an on-premises source
Copying data from one storage account to another storage account
Each of these use cases has unique options. For example, AzCopy has native commands for copying and/or synchronizing data. This makes AzCopy a flexible tool that can be used for one-time copy activities and ongoing synchronization scenarios. AzCopy also allows you to target specific storage services such as Azure Blob Storage or Azure Files. This allows you to copy data from blob to file, file to blob, file to file, etc.
To learn more about these scenarios, see:
Upload files to Azure Blob storage by using AzCopy
Download blobs from Azure Blob Storage by using AzCopy
Copy blobs between Azure storage accounts by using AzCopy
Synchronize with Azure Blob storage by using AzCopy
Note
AzCopy does not support scenarios where the source or destination is being actively changed during the transfer.
Install AzCopy on Linux by using a package manager
You can install AzCopy by using a Linux package that is hosted on theLinux Software Repository for Microsoft Products.

Note
If you want to copy data to and from yourAzure Table storageservice, then installAzCopy version 7.3.
Run AzCopy
For convenience, consider adding the directory location of the AzCopy executable to your system path for ease of use. That way you can typeazcopyfrom any directory on your system.
azcopy
If you choose not to add the AzCopy directory to your path, you'll have to change directories to the location of your AzCopy executable and typeazcopyor.\azcopyin Windows PowerShell command prompts.
azcopy
.\azcopy
As an owner of your Azure Storage account, you aren't automatically assigned permissions to access data. Before you can do anything meaningful with AzCopy, you need to decide how you'll provide authorization credentials to the storage service.

Authorize AzCopy
You can provide authorization credentials by using Microsoft Entra ID, or by using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token.

By using Microsoft Entra ID, you can provide credentials once instead of having to append a SAS token to each command.
You can append a SAS token to each source or destination URL that use in your AzCopy commands.
This example command recursively copies data from a local directory to a blob container. A fictitious SAS token is appended to the end of the container URL.
azcopy copy "C:\local\path" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bjqt&srt=sco&sp=rwddgcup&se=2019-05-01T05:01:17Z&st=2019-04-30T21:01:17Z&spr=https&sig=MGCXiyEzbtttkr3ewJIh2AR8KrghSy1DGM9ovN734bQF4%3D" --recursive=true
azcopy copy "C:\local\path" "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bjqt&srt=sco&sp=rwddgcup&se=2019-05-01T05:01:17Z&st=2019-04-30T21:01:17Z&spr=https&sig=MGCXiyEzbtttkr3ewJIh2AR8KrghSy1DGM9ovN734bQF4%3D" --recursive=true
To learn more about SAS tokens and how to obtain one, seeUsing shared access signatures (SAS).
Note
TheSecure transfer requiredsetting of a storage account determines whether the connection to a storage account is secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS). This setting is enabled by default.

Transfer data
After you've authorized your identity or obtained a SAS token, you can begin transferring data.
To find example commands, see any of these articles.
Get command help
To see a list of commands, typeazcopy -hand then press the ENTER key.
azcopy -h
To learn about a specific command, just include the name of the command (For example:azcopy list -h).
azcopy list -h

List of commands
The following table lists all AzCopy v10 commands. Each command links to a reference article.
Note
AzCopy does not have a command to rename files.
Use in a script
Over time, the AzCopydownload linkwill point to new versions of AzCopy. If your script downloads AzCopy, the script might stop working if a newer version of AzCopy modifies features that your script depends upon.
To avoid these issues, obtain a static (unchanging) link to the current version of AzCopy. That way, your script downloads the same exact version of AzCopy each time that it runs.
Note
The static link to AzCopy binaries is subject to change over time due to our content delivery infrastructure. If you must use a specific version of AzCopy for any reason, we recommend using AzCopy with an operating system that leverages apublished package. This method ensures that you can reliably install and maintain the desired version of AzCopy.
To obtain the link, run this command:
curl -s -D- https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux \| grep ^Location
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows -MaximumRedirection 0 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).headers.location
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows -MaximumRedirection 0 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -SkipHttpErrorCheck).headers.location
Note
For Linux,--strip-components=1on thetarcommand removes the top-level folder that contains the version name, and instead extracts the binary directly into the current folder. This allows the script to be updated with a new version ofazcopyby only updating thewgetURL.
--strip-components=1
tar
azcopy
wget
The URL appears in the output of this command. Your script can then download AzCopy by using that URL.
Linux
wget -O azcopy_v10.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux && tar -xf azcopy_v10.tar.gz --strip-components=1
wget -O azcopy_v10.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux && tar -xf azcopy_v10.tar.gz --strip-components=1
Windows PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <URL from the previous command> -OutFile 'azcopyv10.zip'
Expand-archive -Path '.\azcopyv10.zip' -Destinationpath '.\'
$AzCopy = (Get-ChildItem -path '.\' -Recurse -File -Filter 'azcopy.exe').FullName
# Invoke AzCopy 
& $AzCopy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <URL from the previous command> -OutFile 'azcopyv10.zip'
Expand-archive -Path '.\azcopyv10.zip' -Destinationpath '.\'
$AzCopy = (Get-ChildItem -path '.\' -Recurse -File -Filter 'azcopy.exe').FullName
# Invoke AzCopy 
& $AzCopy
PowerShell 6.1+
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <URL from the previous command> -OutFile 'azcopyv10.zip'
$AzCopy = (Expand-archive -Path '.\azcopyv10.zip' -Destinationpath '.\' -PassThru | where-object {$_.Name -eq 'azcopy.exe'}).FullName
# Invoke AzCopy
& $AzCopy
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <URL from the previous command> -OutFile 'azcopyv10.zip'
$AzCopy = (Expand-archive -Path '.\azcopyv10.zip' -Destinationpath '.\' -PassThru | where-object {$_.Name -eq 'azcopy.exe'}).FullName
# Invoke AzCopy
& $AzCopy
In batch files that have the.cmdextension, you'll have to escape the%characters that appear in SAS tokens. You can do that by adding an extra%character next to existing%characters in the SAS token string. The resulting character sequence appears as%%. Make sure to add an extra^before each&character to create the character sequence^&.
.cmd

Use in Azure Storage Explorer
Storage Exploreruses AzCopy to perform all of its data transfer operations. You can useStorage Explorerif you want to apply the performance advantages of AzCopy, but you prefer to use a graphical user interface rather than the command line to interact with your files.
Storage Explorer uses your account key to perform operations, so after you sign into Storage Explorer, you won't need to provide additional authorization credentials.
