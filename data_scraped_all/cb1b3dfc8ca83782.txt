Microsoft Entra authorizes access rights to secured resources throughAzure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). Azure Storage defines a set of Azure built-in roles that encompass common sets of permissions used to access blob data.
When an Azure role is assigned to a Microsoft Entra security principal, Azure grants access to those resources for that security principal. A Microsoft Entra security principal can be a user, a group, an application service principal, or amanaged identity for Azure resources.
To learn more about using Microsoft Entra ID to authorize access to blob data, seeAuthorize access to blobs using Microsoft Entra ID.
Note
This article shows how to assign an Azure role for access to blob data in a storage account. To learn about assigning roles for management operations in Azure Storage, seeUse the Azure Storage resource provider to access management resources.
Assign an Azure role
You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure Resource Manager template to assign a role for data access.
Azure portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Template
To access blob data in the Azure portal with Microsoft Entra credentials, a user must have the following role assignments:
A data access role, such asStorage Blob Data ReaderorStorage Blob Data Contributor
The Azure Resource ManagerReaderrole, at a minimum
To learn how to assign these roles to a user, follow the instructions provided inAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
TheReaderrole is an Azure Resource Manager role that permits users to view storage account resources, but not modify them. It doesn't provide read permissions to data in Azure Storage, but only to account management resources. TheReaderrole is necessary so that users can navigate to blob containers in the Azure portal.
For example, if you assign theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to user Mary at the level of a container namedsample-container, then Mary is granted read, write, and delete access to all of the blobs in that container. However, if Mary wants to view a blob in the Azure portal, then theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole by itself won't provide sufficient permissions to navigate through the portal to the blob in order to view it. The additional permissions are required to navigate through the portal and view the other resources that are visible there.
A user must be assigned theReaderrole to use the Azure portal with Microsoft Entra credentials. However, if a user is assigned a role withMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/actionpermissions, then the user can use the portal with the storage account keys, via Shared Key authorization. To use the storage account keys, Shared Key access must be permitted for the storage account. For more information on permitting or disallowing Shared Key access, seePrevent Shared Key authorization for an Azure Storage account.
You can also assign an Azure Resource Manager role that provides additional permissions beyond theReaderrole. Assigning the least possible permissions is recommended as a security best practice. For more information, seeBest practices for Azure RBAC.
Note
Prior to assigning yourself a role for data access, you will be able to access data in your storage account via the Azure portal because the Azure portal can also use the account key for data access. For more information, seeChoose how to authorize access to blob data in the Azure portal.
To assign an Azure role to a security principal with PowerShell, call theNew-AzRoleAssignmentcommand. In order to run the command, you must have a role that includesMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermissions assigned to you at the corresponding scope or higher.
The format of the command can differ based on the scope of the assignment, but the-ObjectIdand-RoleDefinitionNameare required parameters. Passing a value for the-Scopeparameter, while not required, is highly recommended to retain the principle of least privilege. By limiting roles and scopes, you limit the resources that are at risk if the security principal is ever compromised.
-ObjectId
-RoleDefinitionName
-Scope
The-ObjectIdparameter is the Microsoft Entra object ID of the user, group, or service principal to which the role is being assigned. To retrieve the identifier, you can useGet-AzADUserto filter Microsoft Entra users, as shown in the following example.
-ObjectId
Get-AzADUser -DisplayName '<Display Name>'
(Get-AzADUser -StartsWith '<substring>').Id
Get-AzADUser -DisplayName '<Display Name>'
(Get-AzADUser -StartsWith '<substring>').Id
The first response returns the security principal, and the second returns the security principal's object ID.
UserPrincipalName : markpdaniels@contoso.com
ObjectType        : User
DisplayName       : Mark P. Daniels
Id                : aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb
Type              : 

aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb
UserPrincipalName : markpdaniels@contoso.com
ObjectType        : User
DisplayName       : Mark P. Daniels
Id                : aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb
Type              : 

aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb
The-RoleDefinitionNameparameter value is the name of the RBAC role that needs to be assigned to the principal. To access blob data in the Azure portal with Microsoft Entra credentials, a user must have the following role assignments:
-RoleDefinitionName
A data access role, such asStorage Blob Data ContributororStorage Blob Data Reader
The Azure Resource ManagerReaderrole
To assign a role scoped to a blob container or a storage account, you should specify a string containing the scope of the resource for the-Scopeparameter. This action conforms to the principle of least privilege, an information security concept in which a user is given the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions. This practice reduces the potential risk of accidental or intentional damage that unnecessary privileges can bring about.
-Scope
The scope for a container is in the form:
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>
The scope for a storage account is in the form:
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>
To assign a role scoped to a storage account, specify a string containing the scope of the container for the--scopeparameter.
--scope
The following example assigns theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to a user. The role assignment is scoped to level of the container. Make sure to replace the sample values and the placeholder values in brackets (<>) with your own values:
<>
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <email> `
    -RoleDefinitionName "Storage Blob Data Contributor" `
    -Scope  "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>"
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <email> `
    -RoleDefinitionName "Storage Blob Data Contributor" `
    -Scope  "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>"
The following example assigns theStorage Blob Data Readerrole to a user by specifying the object ID. The role assignment is scoped to the level of the storage account. Make sure to replace the sample values and the placeholder values in brackets (<>) with your own values:
<>
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectID "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" `
    -RoleDefinitionName "Storage Blob Data Reader" `
    -Scope  "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>"
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectID "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" `
    -RoleDefinitionName "Storage Blob Data Reader" `
    -Scope  "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>"
Your output should be similar to the following:
RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource Group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<Storage Account>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/<Role Assignment ID>
Scope              : /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource Group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<Storage Account>
DisplayName        : Mark Patrick
SignInName         : markpdaniels@contoso.com
RoleDefinitionName : Storage Blob Data Reader
RoleDefinitionId   : <Role Definition ID>
ObjectId           : <Object ID>
ObjectType         : User
CanDelegate        : False
RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource Group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<Storage Account>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/<Role Assignment ID>
Scope              : /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource Group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<Storage Account>
DisplayName        : Mark Patrick
SignInName         : markpdaniels@contoso.com
RoleDefinitionName : Storage Blob Data Reader
RoleDefinitionId   : <Role Definition ID>
ObjectId           : <Object ID>
ObjectType         : User
CanDelegate        : False

To assign an Azure role to a security principal with Azure CLI, use theaz role assignment createcommand. The format of the command can differ based on the scope of the assignment. In order to run the command, you must have a role that includesMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermissions assigned to you at the corresponding scope or higher.
To assign a role scoped to a container, specify a string containing the scope of the container for the--scopeparameter. The scope for a container is in the form:
--scope
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>
The following example assigns theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to a user. The role assignment is scoped to the level of the container. Make sure to replace the sample values and the placeholder values in brackets (<>) with your own values:
<>
az role assignment create \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --assignee <email> \
    --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>"
az role assignment create \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --assignee <email> \
    --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>"
The following example assigns theStorage Blob Data Readerrole to a user by specifying the object ID. To learn more about the--assignee-object-idand--assignee-principal-typeparameters, seeaz role assignment. In this example, the role assignment is scoped to the level of the storage account.

Keep in mind the following points about Azure role assignments in Azure Storage:
When you create an Azure Storage account, you aren't automatically assigned permissions to access data via Microsoft Entra ID. You must explicitly assign yourself an Azure role for Azure Storage. You can assign it at the level of your subscription, resource group, storage account, or container.
When you assign roles or remove role assignments, it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to take effect.
Built-in roles with data actions can be assigned at management groupscope. However, in rare scenarios there might be a significant delay (up to 12 hours) before data action permissions are effective for certain resource types. Permissions will eventually be applied. For built-in roles with data actions, adding or removing role assignments at management group scope is not recommended for scenarios where timely permission activation or revocation, such as Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM), is required.
If the storage account is locked with an Azure Resource Manager read-only lock, then the lock prevents the assignment of Azure roles that are scoped to the storage account or a container.
If you set the appropriate allow permissions to access data via Microsoft Entra ID and are unable to access the data, for example you're getting an "AuthorizationPermissionMismatch" error. Be sure to allow enough time for the permissions changes you made in Microsoft Entra ID to replicate, and be sure that you don't have any deny assignments that block your access, seeUnderstand Azure deny assignments.
Note
You can create custom Azure RBAC roles for granular access to blob data. For more information, seeAzure custom roles.
