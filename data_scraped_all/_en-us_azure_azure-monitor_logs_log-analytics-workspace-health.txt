Azure Service Healthmonitors the health of your cloud resources, including Log Analytics workspaces. When a Log Analytics workspace is healthy, data you collect from resources in your IT environment is available for querying and analysis in a relatively short period of time, known aslatency. This article explains how to view the health status of your Log Analytics workspace, set up workspace health status alerts, and view workspace health metrics.
Azure Service Health monitors:
Resource health: information about the health of your individual cloud resources, such as a specific Log Analytics workspace.
Service health: information about the health of the Azure services and regions you're using, which might affect your Log Analytics workspace, including communications about outages, planned maintenance activities, and other health advisories.
Permissions required
To view Log Analytics workspace health, you need*/readpermissions to the Log Analytics workspace, as provided by theLog Analytics Reader built-in role, for example.
*/read
To set up health status alerts, you needMicrosoft.Insights/ActivityLogAlerts/Writepermissions to the Log Analytics workspace, as provided by theMonitoring Contributor built-in role, for example.

View Log Analytics workspace health and set up health status alerts
To view your Log Analytics workspace health and set up health status alerts:
SelectResource healthfrom the Log Analytics workspace menu.TheResource healthscreen shows:Health history: Indicates whether Azure Service Health has detected latency or query execution issues in the specific Log Analytics workspace. To further investigate latency issues related to your workspace, seeInvestigate latency.Azure service issues: Displayed when a known issue with an Azure service might affect latency in the Log Analytics workspace. Select the message to view details about the service issue in Azure Service Health.NoteService health notifications do not indicate that your Log Analytics workspace is necessarily affected by the know service issue. If your Log Analytics workspace resource health status isAvailable, Azure Service Health did not detect issues in your workspace.Resource Health excludes data types for which long ingestion latency is expected. For example, Application Insights data types that calculate the application map data and are known to add latency.This table describes the possible resource health status values for a Log Analytics workspace:Resource health statusDescriptionAvailableAverage latencyand no query execution issues detected.UnavailableHigher than average latency detected.DegradedQuery failures detected.UnknownCurrently unable to determine Log Analytics workspace health because you haven't run queries or ingested data to this workspace recently.
SelectResource healthfrom the Log Analytics workspace menu.

Note
Service health notifications do not indicate that your Log Analytics workspace is necessarily affected by the know service issue. If your Log Analytics workspace resource health status isAvailable, Azure Service Health did not detect issues in your workspace.
Resource Health excludes data types for which long ingestion latency is expected. For example, Application Insights data types that calculate the application map data and are known to add latency.

This table describes the possible resource health status values for a Log Analytics workspace:
To set up health status alerts, you can eitherenable recommended out-of-the-box alertrules, or manually create new alert rules.To enable the recommended alert rules:SelectAlerts>Enable recommended alert rules.TheEnable recommended alert rulespane opens with a list of recommended alert rules for your Log Analytics workspace.In theAlert me ifsection, select all of the rules you want to enable.In theNotify me bysection, select the way you want to be notified if an alert is triggered.SelectUse an existing action group, and enter the details of the existing action group if you want to use an action group that already exists.SelectEnable.To create a new alert rule:SelectAdd resource health alert.TheCreate alert rulewizard opens, with theScopeandConditionpanes prepopulated. By default, the rule triggers alerts all status changes in all Log Analytics workspaces in the subscription. If necessary, you can edit and modify the scope and condition at this stage.Follow the rest of the steps inCreate a new alert rule in the Azure portal.

View Log Analytics workspace health metrics
Azure Monitor exposes a set of metrics that provide insight into Log Analytics workspace health.
To view Log Analytics workspace health metrics:
SelectMetricsfrom the Log Analytics workspace menu. This opensMetrics Explorerin context of your Log Analytics workspace.
SelectMetricsfrom the Log Analytics workspace menu. This opensMetrics Explorerin context of your Log Analytics workspace.
In theMetricfield, select one of the Log Analytics workspace health metrics:CategoryMetric nameScopeDescriptionSLIAvailabilityRate_QueryWorkspacePercentage of successful user queries in the Log Analytics workspace within the selected time range.This number includes all queries that return 2XX, 4XX, and 504 response codes; in other words, all user queries that don't result in a service error.SLIIngestion TimeWorkspace or tableIndicates the time it takes (in seconds) for a record to become available for queries after being received by Azure Monitor Logs. We recommend you examineingestion timefor specific tables.Available for frequently used tables. To see which tables in your workspaces support the Ingestion Time metric, check the Table Namedimension values for this metric.SLIIngestion VolumeWorkspace or tableNumber of records ingested into a workspace or a table.Available for frequently used tables. To see which tables in your workspaces support the Ingestion Volume metric, check the Table Namedimension values for this metric.User QueriesQuery countWorkspaceTotal number of user queries in the Log Analytics workspace within the selected time range.This number includes only user-initiated queries, and doesn't include queries initiated by Sentinel rules and alert-related queries.User QueriesQuery failure countWorkspaceTotal number of failed user queries in the Log Analytics workspace within the selected time range.This number includes all queries that return 5XX response codes - except 504Gateway Timeout- which indicate an error related to the application gateway or the backend server.Data ExportBytes ExportedWorkspaceTotal number of bytes exported to destination from Log Analytics workspace within the selected time range. The size of data exported is the number of bytes in the exported JSON formatted data. 1 GB = 10^9 bytes.Data ExportExport FailuresWorkspaceTotal number of failed export requests in the Log Analytics workspace within the selected time range.This number includes export failures that can result by Azure Monitor, destination resource availability, or throttling.Data ExportRecords exportedWorkspaceTotal number of records exported from Log Analytics workspace within the selected time range.

Investigate Log Analytics workspace health issues
To investigate Log Analytics workspace health issues:
UseLog Analytics Workspace Insights, which provides a unified view of your workspace usage, performance, health, agent, queries, and change log.
Querythe data in your Log Analytics workspace tounderstand which factors are contributing greater than expected latency in your workspace.
