An in-place upgrade allows you to go from an older operating system to a newer one while keeping your settings, server roles, and data intact. This article teaches you how to move your Azure VMs to a later version of Windows Server using an in-place upgrade. Currently, upgrading to Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022 are supported.
Before you begin an in-place upgrade:
Review the upgrade requirements for the target operating system:Upgrade options for Windows Server 2012 from Windows Server 2008 (64-bit) or Windows Server 2008 R2Upgrade options for Windows Server 2016 from Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2Upgrade options for Windows Server 2019 from Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016Upgrade options for Windows Server 2022 from Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019

Upgrade options for Windows Server 2016 from Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2
Upgrade options for Windows Server 2016 from Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2
Upgrade options for Windows Server 2019 from Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016
Upgrade options for Windows Server 2019 from Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016

Disable antivirus and anti-spyware software and firewalls. These types of software can conflict with the upgrade process. Re-enable antivirus and anti-spyware software and firewalls after the upgrade is completed.

Note
When performing an in-place upgrade on Azure Windows VMs, the VM properties on the Azure portal aren't updated; the changes are only reflected within the OS. This means that the source image information in the VM properties, including the publisher, offer, and plan, remains unchanged. The image used to deploy the VM remains the same, and only the OS is upgraded.
Upgrade VM to volume license (KMS server activation)
The upgrade media provided by Azure requires the VM to be configured for Windows Server volume licensing. This is the default behavior for any Windows Server VM that was installed from a generalized image in Azure. If the VM was imported into Azure, then it might need to be converted to volume licensing to use the upgrade media provided by Azure. To confirm the VM is configured for volume license activation follow these steps toconfigure the appropriate KMS client setup key. If the activation configuration was changed, then follow these steps toverify connectivity to Azure KMS service.
Upgrade to Managed Disks
The in-place upgrade process requires the use of Managed Disks on the VM to be upgraded. Most VMs in Azure are using Managed Disks, and retirement for unmanaged disks support was announced in November of 2022. If the VM is currently using unmanaged disks, then follow these steps tomigrate to Managed Disks.
Create snapshot of the operating system disk
We recommend that you create a snapshot of your operating system disk and any data disks before starting the in-place upgrade process. This enables you to revert to the previous state of the VM if anything fails during the in-place upgrade process. To create a snapshot on each disk, follow these steps tocreate a snapshot of a disk.
Note
During the upgrade process, the upgrade media disk is only created in theen-USlanguage. Currently, no other languages or editions are supported. To avoid errors caused by previously using a different language ISO to install the OS, you can set the system language toen-USor change the system locale toEnglish (United States)in Control Panel.
en-US
en-US
English (United States)
Create upgrade media disk
To start an in-place upgrade the upgrade media must be attached to the VM as a Managed Disk. To create the upgrade media, modify the variables in the following PowerShell script for Windows Server 2022. The upgrade media disk can be used to upgrade multiple VMs, but it can only be used to upgrade a single VM at a time. To upgrade multiple VMs simultaneously multiple upgrade disks must be created for each simultaneous upgrade.
server2016Upgrade
server2019Upgrade
server2022Upgrade
server2012Upgrade
If you have more than one subscription, you should runSet-AzContext -Subscription '<subscription name or id>to specify which subscription to use.
Set-AzContext -Subscription '<subscription name or id>

Recover from failure
If the in-place upgrade process failed to complete successfully you can return to the previous version of the VM if snapshots of the operating system disk and data disk(s) were created. To revert the VM to the previous state using snapshots complete the following steps:
