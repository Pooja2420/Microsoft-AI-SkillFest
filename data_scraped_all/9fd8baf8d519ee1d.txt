Cluster libraries can be used by all notebooks and jobs running on a cluster. This article details using theInstall libraryUI in the Azure Databricks workspace.
Note
If you create compute using a policy that enforces library installations, you canât install or uninstall libraries on your compute. Workspace admins control all library management at the policy level.
You can install libraries to a cluster using the following approaches:
Install a library for use with a specific cluster only.
Install a library with the REST API. See theLibraries API.
Install a library with Databricks CLI. SeeWhat is the Databricks CLI?.
Install a library using Terraform. SeeDatabricks Terraform provideranddatabricks_library.
Install a library by creating a cluster with a policy that defines library installations. SeeAdd libraries to a policy.
(Not recommended) Install a library using an init script that runs at cluster creation time. SeeInstall a library with an init script (legacy).
Install a library on a cluster
To install a library on a cluster:
ClickComputein the sidebar.
Click a cluster name.
Click theLibrariestab.
ClickInstall New.
TheInstall librarydialog displays.
Select one of theLibrary Sourceoptions, complete the instructions that appear, and then clickInstall.
Important
Libraries can be installed from DBFS when using Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS and below. However, any workspace user can modify library files stored in DBFS. To improve the security of libraries in a Azure Databricks workspace, storing library files in the DBFS root is deprecated and disabled by default in Databricks Runtime 15.1 and above. SeeStoring libraries in DBFS root is deprecated and disabled by default.
Instead, Databricksrecommendsuploading all libraries, including Python libraries, JAR files, and Spark connectors, to workspace files or Unity Catalog volumes, or using library package repositories. If your workload does not support these patterns, you can also use libraries stored in cloud object storage.
Not all cluster access modes support all library configurations. SeeCompute-scoped libraries.

When you install a library on a cluster, a notebook already attached to that cluster will not immediately see the new library. You must firstdetachand thenreattachthe notebook to the cluster.
Note
A library that has taken more than 2 hours to install will be marked as failed.
Install a library using a policy
If you create a cluster using a policy that enforces library installation, specified libraries automatically install on your cluster. You cannot install additional libraries or uninstall any libraries.
Workspace admins can add libraries to policies, allowing them to manage and enforce library installations on all compute that uses the policy. For admin instructions, seeAdd libraries to a policy.
Uninstall a library from a cluster
Note
When you uninstall a library from a cluster, the library is removed only when you restart the cluster. Until you restart the cluster, the status of the uninstalled library appears asUninstall pending restart.
To uninstall a library you can use the cluster UI:
ClickComputein the sidebar.
Click a cluster name.
Click theLibrariestab.
Select the checkbox next to the cluster you want to uninstall the library from, clickUninstall, thenConfirm. The Status changes toUninstall pending restart.
ClickRestartandConfirmto uninstall the library. The library is removed from the clusterâs Libraries tab.
View the libraries installed on a cluster
ClickComputein the sidebar.
Click the cluster name.
Click theLibrariestab. For each library, the tab displays the name and version, type,install status, and, if uploaded, the source file.
Update a cluster-installed library
To update a cluster-installed library, uninstall the old version of the library and install a new version.
Note
Requirements.txt files do not require uninstalling and restarting. If you have modified the contents of a requirements.txt file, you can simply reinstall it to update the contents of the installed file.
