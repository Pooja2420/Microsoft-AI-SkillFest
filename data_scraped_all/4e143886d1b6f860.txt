This article describes how to create alert processing rules in the Azure portal. Alert processing rules trigger or suppress notifications for device events that occur within a resource group, an Azure subscription, or an individual Azure Stack Edge resource.
About alert processing rules
An alert processing rule can add action groups to alert notifications. Use alert notification preferences, like email or SMS messages, to notify users when alerts are triggered.
For more information about alert processing rules, seeAlert processing rules. For more information about action groups, seeCreate and manage action groups in the Azure portal.

View notifications
Notifications go out when an event triggers an alert for a resource within the scope of an alert processing rule.
The action group for an alert processing rule determines who receives a notification and the type of notification to send. Notifications can be sent via email, SMS message, or both.
It may take a few minutes to receive notifications after an alert is triggered.
The email notification looks similar to the following example.
