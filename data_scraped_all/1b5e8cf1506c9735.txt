In this article
This security baseline applies guidance from theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark version 1.0to HDInsight. The Microsoft cloud security benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the security controls defined by the Microsoft cloud security benchmark and the related guidance applicable to HDInsight.
You can monitor this security baseline and its recommendations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Azure Policy definitions will be listed in the Regulatory Compliance section of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal page.
When a feature has relevant Azure Policy Definitions, they are listed in this baseline to help you measure compliance with the Microsoft cloud security benchmark controls and recommendations. Some recommendations may require a paid Microsoft Defender plan to enable certain security scenarios.
Note
Featuresnot applicable to HDInsight have been excluded.
Security profile
The security profile summarizes high-impact behaviors of HDInsight, which may result in increased security considerations.
Network security
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Network security.
NS-1: Establish network segmentation boundaries
Description: Service supports deployment into customer's private Virtual Network (VNet).Learn more.
Feature notes: Perimeter security in Azure HDInsight is achieved through virtual networks. An enterprise administrator can create a cluster inside a virtual network and use a network security group (NSG) to restrict access to the virtual network.
Configuration Guidance: Deploy the service into a virtual network. Assign private IPs to the resource (where applicable) unless there is a strong reason to assign public IPs directly to the resource.
Note: Based on your applications and enterprise segmentation strategy, restrict or allow traffic between internal resources based on your NSG rules. For specific, well-defined applications like a three-tier app, this can be a highly secure deny-by-default.
Reference:Plan a virtual network for Azure HDInsight
Description: Service network traffic respects Network Security Groups rule assignment on its subnets.Learn more.
Feature notes: Perimeter security in Azure HDInsight is achieved through virtual networks. An enterprise administrator can create a cluster inside a virtual network and use a network security group (NSG) to restrict access to the virtual network. Only the allowed IP addresses in the inbound NSG rules can communicate with the Azure HDInsight cluster. This configuration provides perimeter security. All clusters deployed in a virtual network will also have a private endpoint. The endpoint will resolve to a private IP address inside the Virtual Network. It provides private HTTP access to the cluster gateways.
Based on your applications and enterprise segmentation strategy, restrict or allow traffic between internal resources based on your NSG rules. For specific, well-defined applications like a three-tier app, this can be a highly secure deny-by-default.
Ports required generally across all types of clusters:
22-23 - SSH access to the cluster resources
443 - Ambari, WebHCat REST API, HiveServer ODBC, and JDBC
Configuration Guidance: Use network security groups (NSG) to restrict or monitor traffic by port, protocol, source IP address, or destination IP address. Create NSG rules to restrict your service's open ports (such as preventing management ports from being accessed from untrusted networks). Be aware that by default, NSGs deny all inbound traffic but allow traffic from virtual network and Azure Load Balancers.
Reference:Control network traffic in Azure HDInsight
NS-2: Secure cloud services with network controls
Description: Service native IP filtering capability for filtering network traffic (not to be confused with NSG or Azure Firewall).Learn more.
Feature notes: Use Azure Private Link to enable private access to HDInsight from your virtual networks without crossing the internet. Private access adds a defense-in-depth measure to Azure authentication and traffic security.
Configuration Guidance: Deploy private endpoints for all Azure resources that support the Private Link feature, to establish a private access point for the resources.
Note: Use Azure Private Link to enable private access to HDInsight from your virtual networks without crossing the internet. Private access adds a defense-in-depth measure to Azure authentication and traffic security.
Reference:Enable Private Link on an HDInsight cluster
Description: Service supports disabling public network access either through using service-level IP ACL filtering rule (not NSG or Azure Firewall) or using a 'Disable Public Network Access' toggle switch.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: Disable public network access either using the service-level IP ACL filtering rule or a toggling switch for public network access.
Reference:Restrict public connectivity in Azure HDInsight
Identity management
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Identity management.
IM-1: Use centralized identity and authentication system
Description: Service supports using Azure AD authentication for data plane access.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the default authentication method to control your data plane access.
Reference:Overview of enterprise security in Azure HDInsight
Description: Local authentications methods supported for data plane access, such as a local username and password.Learn more.
Feature notes: When an HDI cluster is created, two local admin accounts are created in the data plane (Apache Ambari).  One corresponding to the user for which credential is passed by the cluster creator.  The other is created by the HDI control plane.  The HDI control plane uses this account to make data plane calls. Avoid the usage of local authentication methods or accounts, these should be disabled wherever possible. Instead use Azure AD to authenticate where possible.
Configuration Guidance: No additional configurations are required as this is enabled on a default deployment.
IM-3: Manage application identities securely and automatically
Description: Data plane actions support authentication using managed identities.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
Description: Data plane supports authentication using service principals.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
IM-7: Restrict resource access based on conditions
Description: Data plane access can be controlled using Azure AD Conditional Access Policies.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
IM-8: Restrict the exposure of credential and secrets
Description: Data plane supports native use of Azure Key Vault for credential and secrets store.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
Privileged access
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Privileged access.
PA-1: Separate and limit highly privileged/administrative users
Description: Service has the concept of a local administrative account.Learn more.
Feature notes: When an HDI cluster is created, two local admin accounts are created in the data plane (Apache Ambari).  One corresponding to the user for which credential is passed by the cluster creator.  The other is created by the HDI control plane.  The HDI control plane uses this account to make data plane calls. Avoid the usage of local authentication methods or accounts, these should be disabled wherever possible. Instead use Azure AD to authenticate where possible.
Configuration Guidance: No additional configurations are required as this is enabled on a default deployment.
PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege) principle
Description: Azure Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC) can be used to managed access to service's data plane actions.Learn more.
Feature notes: Data plane supports only Ambari based roles. Fine grained ACL is done via Ranger.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
PA-8: Determine access process for cloud provider support
Description: Customer Lockbox can be used for Microsoft support access.Learn more.
Feature notes: In support scenarios where Microsoft needs to access customer data, HDInsight supports Customer Lockbox. It provides an interface for you to review customer data access requests and approve or reject them.
Configuration Guidance: In support scenarios where Microsoft needs to access your data, use Customer Lockbox to review, then approve or reject each of Microsoft's data access requests.
Reference:Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure
Data protection
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Data protection.
DP-1: Discover, classify, and label sensitive data
Description: Tools (such as Azure Purview or Azure Information Protection) can be used for data discovery and classification in the service.Learn more.
Feature notes: Use tags on resources related to your Azure HDInsight deployments to help tracking Azure resources that store or process sensitive information. Classify and identify sensitive data using Microsoft Purview. Use the service for any data stored in SQL databases or Azure Storage accounts associated to your HDInsight cluster.
For the underlying platform, which Microsoft manages, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive. Microsoft goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.
Configuration Guidance: Use tools such as Azure Purview, Azure Information Protection, and Azure SQL Data Discovery and Classification to centrally scan, classify and label any sensitive data that resides in Azure, on-premises, Microsoft 365, or other locations.
Reference:Azure customer data protection
DP-2: Monitor anomalies and threats targeting sensitive data
Description: Service supports DLP solution to monitor sensitive data movement (in customer's content).Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
DP-3: Encrypt sensitive data in transit
Description: Service supports data in-transit encryption for data plane.Learn more.
Feature notes: HDInsight supports data encryption in transit with TLS v1.2 or greater. Encrypt all sensitive information in transit. Make sure that any clients connecting to your Azure HDInsight cluster or cluster data stores (Azure Storage Accounts or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1/Gen2) can negotiate TLS 1.2 or greater. Microsoft Azure resources will negotiate TLS 1.2 by default.
To complement access controls, protect data in transit against "out of band" attacks like traffic capture. Use encryption to make sure that attackers can't easily read or modify the data.
For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of an unencrypted protocol. Obsolete SSL, TLS, SSH versions and protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.
Configuration Guidance: Enable secure transfer in services where there is a native data in transit encryption feature built in. Enforce HTTPS on any web applications and services and ensure TLS v1.2 or later is used. Legacy versions such as SSL 3.0, TLS v1.0 should be disabled. For remote management of Virtual Machines, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of an unencrypted protocol.
Note: HDInsight supports data encryption in transit with TLS v1.2 or greater. Encrypt all sensitive information in transit. Make sure that any clients connecting to your Azure HDInsight cluster or cluster data stores (Azure Storage Accounts or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1/Gen2) can negotiate TLS 1.2 or greater.

By default, Azure provides encryption for data in transit between Azure data centers.
DP-4: Enable data at rest encryption by default
Description: Data at-rest encryption using platform keys is supported, any customer content at rest is encrypted with these Microsoft managed keys.Learn more.
Feature notes: If using Azure SQL Database to store Apache Hive and Apache Oozie metadata, ensure SQL data always remains encrypted. For Azure Storage Accounts and Data Lake Storage (Gen1 or Gen2), it's recommended to allow Microsoft to manage your encryption keys, however, you can manage your own keys.
HDInsight supports multiple types of encryption in two different layers:
Server Side Encryption (SSE) - SSE is performed by the storage service. In HDInsight, SSE is used to encrypt OS disks and data disks. It's enabled by default. SSE is a layer 1 encryption service.
Encryption at host using platform-managed key - Similar to SSE, this type of encryption is performed by the storage service. However, it's only for temporary disks and isn't enabled by default. Encryption at host is also a layer 1 encryption service.
Encryption at rest using customer managed key - This type of encryption can be used on data and temporary disks. It isn't enabled by default and requires the customer to provide their own key through Azure key vault. Encryption at rest is a layer 2 encryption service.
Configuration Guidance: Enable data at rest encryption using platform managed (Microsoft managed) keys where not automatically configured by the service.
Note: If using Azure SQL Database to store Apache Hive and Apache Oozie metadata, ensure SQL data always remains encrypted. For Azure Storage Accounts and Data Lake Storage (Gen1 or Gen2), it's recommended to allow Microsoft to manage your encryption keys, however, you can manage your own keys.

Configuration Guidance: Use Azure Key Vault to create and control the life cycle of your encryption keys, including key generation, distribution, and storage. Rotate and revoke your keys in Azure Key Vault and your service based on a defined schedule or when there is a key retirement or compromise. When there is a need to use customer-managed key (CMK) in the workload, service, or application level, ensure you follow the best practices for key management: Use a key hierarchy to generate a separate data encryption key (DEK) with your key encryption key (KEK) in your key vault. Ensure keys are registered with Azure Key Vault and referenced via key IDs from the service or application. If you need to bring your own key (BYOK) to the service (such as importing HSM-protected keys from your on-premises HSMs into Azure Key Vault), follow recommended guidelines to perform initial key generation and key transfer.
Note: If you're using Azure Key Vault with your Azure HDInsight deployment, periodically test restoration of backed up customer-managed keys.
