Custom Vision supports Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), an authorization system for managing individual access to Azure resources. Using Azure RBAC, you can assign different team members different levels of permissions for your Custom Vision projects. For more information on Azure RBAC, see theAzure RBAC documentation.

Azure RBAC can be assigned to a Custom Vision resource. To grant access to an Azure resource, you add a role assignment.

Do this by selecting the desired scope level and then navigating to the desired item (for example, selectingResource groupsand then clicking through to your wanted resource group).
