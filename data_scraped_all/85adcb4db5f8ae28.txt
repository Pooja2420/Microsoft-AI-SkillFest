An Azure container registry stores and manages private Docker container images, similar to the way Docker Hub stores public Docker images. It can also host repositories forHelm charts(preview), a packaging format to deploy applications to Kubernetes. You can use webhooks to trigger events when certain actions take place in one of your registry repositories. Webhooks can respond to events at the registry level, or they can be scoped down to a specific repository tag. With ageo-replicatedregistry, you configure each webhook to respond to events in a specific regional replica.
The endpoint for a webhook must be publicly accessible from the registry. You can configure registry webhook requests to authenticate to a secured endpoint.
For details on webhook requests, seeAzure Container Registry webhook schema reference.
Prerequisites
Azure container registry - Create a container registry in your Azure subscription. For example, use theAzure portalor theAzure CLI. TheAzure Container Registry service tiershave different webhooks quotas.
Docker CLI - To set up your local computer as a Docker host and access the Docker CLI commands, installDocker Engine.
Create webhook - Azure portal
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate to the container registry in which you want to create a webhook.
UnderServices, selectWebhooks.
SelectAddin the webhook toolbar.
Complete theCreate webhookform with the following information:
Example webhook form:

Create webhook - Azure CLI
To create a webhook using the Azure CLI, use theaz acr webhook createcommand. The following command creates a webhook for all image delete events in the registrymycontainerregistry:
az acr webhook create --registry mycontainerregistry --name myacrwebhook01 --actions delete --uri http://webhookuri.com
az acr webhook create --registry mycontainerregistry --name myacrwebhook01 --actions delete --uri http://webhookuri.com
Test webhook
Azure portal
Prior to using the webhook, you can test it with thePingbutton. Ping sends a generic POST request to the specified endpoint and logs the response. Using the ping feature can help you verify you've correctly configured the webhook.
Select the webhook you want to test.
In the top toolbar, selectPing.
Check the endpoint's response in theHTTP STATUScolumn.

Azure CLI
To test an ACR webhook with the Azure CLI, use theaz acr webhook pingcommand.
az acr webhook ping --registry mycontainerregistry --name myacrwebhook01
az acr webhook ping --registry mycontainerregistry --name myacrwebhook01
To see the results, use theaz acr webhook list-eventscommand.
az acr webhook list-events --registry mycontainerregistry08 --name myacrwebhook01
az acr webhook list-events --registry mycontainerregistry08 --name myacrwebhook01
Delete webhook
Azure portal
Each webhook can be deleted by selecting the webhook and then theDeletebutton in the Azure portal.
Azure CLI
az acr webhook delete --registry mycontainerregistry --name myacrwebhook01
az acr webhook delete --registry mycontainerregistry --name myacrwebhook01

Event Grid events
In addition to the native registry webhook events discussed in this article, Azure Container Registry can emit events to Event Grid:
