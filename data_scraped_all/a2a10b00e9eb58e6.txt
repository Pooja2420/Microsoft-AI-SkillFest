Azure Key Vault allows you to easily provision, manage, and deploy digital certificates for your network and to enable secure communications for applications. A digital certificate is an electronic credential that establishes proof of identity in an electronic transaction.
Azure Key Vault has a trusted partnership with the following Certificate Authorities:
DigiCert
GlobalSign
Azure Key Vault users can generate DigiCert/GlobalSign certificates directly from their key vaults. Key Vault's partnership ensures end-to-end certificate lifecycle management for certificates issued by DigiCert.
For more general information about certificates, seeAzure Key Vault certificates.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you start.
Prerequisites
To complete the procedures in this article, you need to have:
A key vault. You can use an existing key vault or create one by completing the steps in one of these quickstarts:Create a key vault by using the Azure CLICreate a key vault by using Azure PowerShellCreate a key vault by using the Azure portal
Create a key vault by using the Azure CLI
Create a key vault by using Azure PowerShell
Create a key vault by using the Azure portal
An activated DigiCert CertCentral account.Sign upfor your CertCentral account.
Administrator-level permissions in your accounts.
Before you begin
Make sure you have the following information from your DigiCert CertCentral account:
CertCentral account ID
Organization ID
API key
Account ID
Account Password
Make sure you have the following information from your Global Sign account:
Account ID
Account Password
First Name of Administrator
Last Name of Administrator
E-mail of Administrator
Phone Number of Administrator
Add the certificate authority in Key Vault
After you gather the preceding information from your DigiCert CertCentral account, you can add DigiCert to the certificate authority list in the key vault.
Azure portal (DigiCert)
To add DigiCert certificate authority, go to the key vault you want to add it to.

GlobalSignCA is now in the certificate authority list.
Azure PowerShell
You can use Azure PowerShell to create and manage Azure resources by using commands or scripts. Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through the Azure portal in a browser.
If you choose to use Azure PowerShell locally:Install the latest version of the Az PowerShell module.Connect to your Azure account using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet.

The certificate is now issued by DigiCert certificate authority in the specified key vault.
Troubleshoot
If the certificate issued is in disabled status in the Azure portal, view the certificate operation to review the DigiCert error message for the certificate:

Error message: "Please perform a merge to complete this certificate request."
Merge the CSR signed by the certificate authority to complete the request. For information about merging a CSR, seeCreate and merge a CSR.
For more information, seeCertificate operations in the Key Vault REST API reference. For information on establishing permissions, seeVaults - Create or updateandVaults - Update access policy.
