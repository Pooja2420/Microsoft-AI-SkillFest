Instructs the user agent to render a visualization of the query results.
The render operator must be the last operator in the query, and can only be used with queries that produce a single tabular data stream result.  The render operator doesn't modify data. It injects an annotation ("Visualization") into the result's extended  properties. The annotation contains the information provided by the operator in the query. The interpretation of the visualization information is done by the user agent. Different agents, such as Kusto.Explorer or Azure Data Explorer web UI, may support different visualizations.
The data model of the render operator looks at the tabular data as if it has
three kinds of columns:
The x axis column (indicated by thexcolumnproperty).
xcolumn
The series columns (any number of columns indicated by theseriesproperty.) For each record, the combined values of these columns define a single series, and the chart has as many series as there are distinct combined values.
series
The y axis columns (any number of columns indicated by theycolumnsproperty). For each record, the series has as many measurements ("points" in the chart) as there are y-axis columns.
ycolumns
Tip
Usewhere,summarizeandtopto limit the volume that you display.
where
summarize
top
Sort the data to define the order of the x-axis.
User agents are free to "guess" the value of properties that are not specified
by the query. In particular, having "uninteresting" columns in the schema of
the result might translate into them guessing wrong. Try projecting-away such
columns when that happens.
Note
There are some visualizations which are only available in Azure Data Explorer dashboards. For more information, seeDashboard-specific visuals.

How to render continuous data
Several visualizations are used for rendering sequences of values, for example,linechart,timechart, andareachart.
These visualizations have the following conceptual model:
linechart
timechart
areachart
One column in the table represents the x-axis of the data. This column can be explicitly defined using thexcolumnproperty. If not defined, the user agent picks the first column that is appropriate for the visualization.For example: in thetimechartvisualization, the user agent uses the firstdatetimecolumn.If this column is of typedynamicand it holds an array, the individual values in the array will be treated as the values of the x-axis.
xcolumn
For example: in thetimechartvisualization, the user agent uses the firstdatetimecolumn.
timechart
datetime
If this column is of typedynamicand it holds an array, the individual values in the array will be treated as the values of the x-axis.
dynamic
One or more columns in the table represent one or more measures that vary by the x-axis.
These columns can be explicitly defined using theycolumnsproperty. If not defined, the user agent picks all columns that are appropriate for the visualization.For example: in thetimechartvisualization, the user agent uses all columns with a numeric value that haven't been specified otherwise.If the x-axis is an array, the values of each y-axis should also be an array of a similar length, with each y-axis occurring in a single column.
ycolumns
For example: in thetimechartvisualization, the user agent uses all columns with a numeric value that haven't been specified otherwise.
timechart
If the x-axis is an array, the values of each y-axis should also be an array of a similar length, with each y-axis occurring in a single column.
Zero or more columns in the table represent a unique set of dimensions that group together the measures. These columns can be specified by theseriesproperty, or the user agent will pick them automatically from the columns that are otherwise unspecified.

as there are y-axis columns.
