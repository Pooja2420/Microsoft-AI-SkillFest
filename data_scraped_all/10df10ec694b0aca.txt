You can deploy new volumes in the logical availability zone of your choice. You can also populate existing volumes with availability zone information. To better understand availability zones, seeUse availability zone volume placement for high availability.
Requirements and considerations
Important
If you're using availability zones with custom roles or the built-in Contributor RBAC role, ensure you have the appropriate permissions set. Not having certain permissions can cause issues in the Azure portal. For configuration details, seeConfigure custom RBAC roles.
This feature doesn't guarantee free capacity in the availability zone. For example, even if you can deploy a VM in availability zone 3 of the East US region, it doesnât guarantee free Azure NetApp Files capacity in that zone. If no sufficient capacity is available, volume creation will fail.

NetApp accounts and capacity pools aren't bound by the availability zone. A capacity pool can contain volumes in different availability zones.

This feature provides zonal volume placement, with latency within the zonal latency envelopes. Itdoes notprovide proximity placement towards compute. As such, itdoes notprovide lowest latency guarantee.

Each data center is assigned to a physical zone. Physical zones are mapped to logical zones in your Azure subscription. Azure subscriptions are automatically assigned this mapping at the time a subscription is created. This feature aligns with the generic logical-to-physical availability zone mapping for the subscription.

VMs and Azure NetApp Files volumes are to be deployed separately, within the same logical availability zone to create zone alignment between VMs and Azure NetApp Files. The availability zone volume placement feature doesn't create zonal VMs upon volume creation, or vice versa.

For volumes in different availability zones, Azure NetApp Files allows you to create volumes with the same file path (NFS), share name (SMB), or volume path (dual-protocol).

Important
It's not recommended that you use availability zones for Terraform-managed volumes. If you do, you mustadd the zone property to your volume.

You can't select an availability zone or move the volume to another availability zone by using this feature. If you want to move this volume to another availability zone, consider usingcross-zone replication(after populating the volume with the availability zone information).

Populate availability zone for Terraform-managed volumes
The populate availability zone features requires azoneproperty on the volume. You can set the zone property only when you create the Terraform-managed volume, but you can't modify it after the volume has been created. Adding thezoneproperty after the volume has been created can cause data loss or loss of the volume if the specified zone value does not match the availability zone.

To prevent data loss on any Azure resource that includes volatile resources, you should use theprevent_destroylifecycle argument.

Configure custom RBAC roles
If you're using a custom RBAC role or thebuilt-in Contributor roleand managing availability zonesin the Azure portal, you might not be able to access network features and Availability Zone options in the Azure portal. To ensure you have the appropriate access, add theMicrosoft.NetApp/locations/*permission. The wildcard encompasses the following permissions:
Microsoft.NetApp/locations/*
Microsoft.NetApp/locations/{location}/checkNameAvailability
Microsoft.NetApp/locations/{location}/checkNameAvailability
Microsoft.NetApp/locations/{location}/checkFilePathAvailability
Microsoft.NetApp/locations/{location}/checkFilePathAvailability
