Azure offers metrics in the Azure portal that provide insight into your Elastic SAN resources. This article provides definitions of the specific metrics you can select to monitor.
Metrics definitions
The following metrics are currently available for your Elastic SAN resource. You can configure and view them in the Azure portal:
By default, all metrics are shown at the SAN level. To view these metrics at either the volume group or volume level, select a filter on your selected metric to view your data on a specific volume group or volume.
Resource logging
You can configure thediagnostic settingsof your elastic SAN to send Azure platform logs and metrics to different destinations. Currently, there are two log configurations:
All - Every resource log offered by the resource.
Audit - All resource logs that record customer interactions with data or the settings of the service.
Audit logs are an attempt by each resource provider to provide the most relevant audit data, but might not be considered sufficient from an auditing standards perspective.
Available log categories:
Write Success Requests
Write Failed Requests
Read Success Requests
Read Failed Requests
Persistent Reservation Requests
SendTargets Requests
