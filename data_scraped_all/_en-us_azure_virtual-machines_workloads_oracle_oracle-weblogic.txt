This page describes the solutions for running Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). These solutions are jointly developed and supported by Oracle and Microsoft.
You can also run WebLogic Server on the Azure Kubernetes Service. The solutions to do so are described in the articleRunning Oracle WebLogic Server on the Azure Kubernetes Service.
WebLogic Server is a leading Java application server running some of the most mission-critical enterprise Java applications across the globe. WebLogic Server forms the middleware foundation for the Oracle software suite. Oracle and Microsoft are committed to empowering WebLogic customers with choice and flexibility to run workloads on Azure as a leading cloud platform.
There are several offers that target use cases such assingle instance with Administration server enabledand WebLogic cluster including bothstatic clusteranddynamic clusters. These offers are solution templates that aim to expedite your Java application deployment to Azure Virtual Machines. They automatically provision virtual network, storage, Java, WebLogic, and the Linux resources required for most common cloud provisioning scenarios. After initial provisioning is done, you're free to customize deployments further.

The offers are Bring-Your-Own-License. They assume you have the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Azure.
The solution templates support a range of operating system, Java, and WebLogic Server versions through base images (such as WebLogic Server 14 and Java 11 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8). Thesebase imagesare also available on Azure Marketplace on their own. The base images are suitable for customers that require complex, customized Azure deployments.

WebLogic Server single instance with admin console on Azure VM
The solution templateWebLogic Server single instance with admin console on Azure VMprovisions a single virtual machine (VM) and installs WebLogic Server on it. It creates a domain and starts up an administration server. After the solution template performs most boilerplate resource provisioning and configuration, you can manage the domain and get started with Java application deployments right away.
For the getting started guidance, seeQuickstart: Deploy WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machine using the Azure portal. For deployment guidance, seeUsing Oracle WebLogic Server on Microsoft Azure IaaS.
WebLogic Server configured cluster on Azure VMs
The solution templateWebLogic Server configured cluster on Azure VMscreates a highly available configured cluster of WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machines. The administration server and all managed servers are started by default. After the solution template performs most boilerplate resource provisioning and configuration, you can manage the cluster and get started with highly available applications right away. For deployment guidance, seeUsing Oracle WebLogic Server on Microsoft Azure IaaS.
The solution enables a wide range of production-ready deployment architectures with relative ease. You can meet most migration cases in the most productive way possible by allowing a focus on business application development.

After resources are automatically provisioned by the solutions, you have complete flexibility to customize your deployments further. It's likely that, on top of deploying applications, you integrate further Azure resources with your deployments. You're encouraged toconnect with the development teamand provide feedback on further improving WebLogic on Azure solutions.
If you prefer step-by-step guidance for going from zero to a WebLogic Server cluster without any solution templates or base images, seeInstall Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machines manually.
WebLogic Server dynamic cluster on Azure VMs
The solution templateWebLogic Server dynamic cluster on Azure VMscreates a dynamic cluster of WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machines. Administration Server is on one of the Azure Virtual Machines. For deployment guidance, seeUsing Oracle WebLogic Server on Microsoft Azure IaaS.
WebLogic Server on Azure VM Base Images
The solution templates, previously introduced, support a range of operating system, Java, and WebLogic Server versions through base images - such as WebLogic Server 14 and Java 11 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. These base images are also available on Azure Marketplace on their own. The base images are suitable for customers that require complex, customized Azure deployments. Use the keywordsoracle weblogic base imageto search for the current set ofbase images of WebLogic Server on Azure VMavailable in Azure Marketplace.
