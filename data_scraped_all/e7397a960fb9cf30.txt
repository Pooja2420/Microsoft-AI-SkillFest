This article covers the targeted optimization of workloads using flows. Different components of a workload have varying requirements and levels of importance. By segmenting a workload into flows, you can prioritize different parts of a workload and better align workload investments with the importance of each flow.
This workload optimization process is iterative and involves three key steps: (1) define the flow structure within your workload, (2) define technical requirements, and (3) design the flow to meet the requirements (see figure 1).
Figure 1: The process to optimize workloads using flows.
Define the flow
Before you can define flow requirements, you need to understand the business drivers for the flow. The prerequisites to defining a flow are identifying the business process and use case its supports. When you understand the prerequisites, you can start documenting the flow.
Understand the prerequisites
Flows are sequences of actions that support workload functionality. There are two primary types of flows: user flows and system flows. User flows determine user interactions. System flows determine communication between workload components. Flows support business processes and use cases. A workload consists of multiple use cases. You need to identify the business process and use case the flow supports before documenting a flow (see figure 2).
Figure 2: The relationship between business processes, use cases, flows, and workload.
A business process is a series of actions (stages) that fulfill a business requirement. Flows determine the sequence a user or data takes to accomplish each stage of a business process. For example, selling products online is a business process. The stages in this business process might be listing the product online, receiving orders, and delivering the product.
A use case defines the functional requirements of a flow. You need to identify and understand the use case a flow supports before establishing the technical requirements of a flow. Each use case should support one stage in a business process (see figure 2). A use case should define the following attributes:
Purpose: Clearly articulate the tasks or objectives, like enabling online purchases. This clarity guides the functional design and sets clear goals for flow design.
Purpose: Clearly articulate the tasks or objectives, like enabling online purchases. This clarity guides the functional design and sets clear goals for flow design.
Criticality: Assess the importance of the use case, ranging from routine to critical. The value assigned to a use case informs the prioritization and design of the flow. High-value use cases might require enhanced error handling, performance tuning, or user experience considerations.
Criticality: Assess the importance of the use case, ranging from routine to critical. The value assigned to a use case informs the prioritization and design of the flow. High-value use cases might require enhanced error handling, performance tuning, or user experience considerations.
Consumers: Identify whether users (customers, staff) or system components are the primary consumers. This categorization determines whether it's a user flow or system flow and influences the design.

Events: Define triggers or conditions that initiate and conclude the use case. These events define the flow's boundaries.

Execution: Understand the operational frequency and variability of the use case to anticipate system load. You must design a flow to handle different execution scenarios.

Dependencies: Identify interdependencies with other use cases for risk management. Recognizing a use case's dependencies aids in designing flows that integrate smoothly with other system parts. You need to ensure the availability of necessary inputs and compatibility of outputs with subsequent processes.

Document the flow
Use the use case to document the flow. You should outline or map each action you need in a flow. Capture decision criteria and pathways. Identify interactions with other use cases. This outline serves as a blueprint for flow design and management. You also need to capture business information about the flow. Make sure to include the following details in the flow documentation:

Define flow requirements
Utilize the use case to establish the technical targets of the flow. Define measurable targets for the flow that align to the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework (WAF). These pillars provide a framework for setting technical targets:
Reliability targets: Assess each flow's importance and set reliability targets accordingly. Determine performance thresholds and establish clear service level agreements (SLAs) and objectives (SLOs). Higher criticality flows require more stringent reliability targets.

Design the flow
Design the flow to meet the technical targets. You should familiarize yourself with flow design best practices so that you achieve the right result. Build and test the flow. Iterate on the design until it meets the technical targets you established.

As you design a flow, follow flow design best practices. A well-designed flow has the following attributes:
Scoped: Identify distinct starting and ending points for each flow. Clear boundaries help optimize user or system interactions.

Business impact: This flow is important for making new concerts available on sales platforms, directly influencing the main revenue stream of the business. When call-center employees are unable to create concerts due to the unavailability of this flow, it negatively impacts both revenue and the company's reputation. However, high availability isn't essential for this process since concerts are typically scheduled in advance on a weekly basis. The sales department specified a requirement of 95% availability for this process and is agreeable to downtime outside of business hours for maintenance purposes.
