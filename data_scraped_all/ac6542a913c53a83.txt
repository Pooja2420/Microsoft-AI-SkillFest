Note
Count aggregation is not recommended for any of the NAT gateway metrics. Count aggregation adds up the number of metric values and not the metric values themselves. Use Sum aggregation instead to get the best representation of data values for connection count, bytes, and packets metrics.
Use average for best represented health data for the datapath availability metric.
For information about aggregation types, seeaggregation types.

Note
When NAT gateway is attached to a subnet and public IP address, the Azure platform verifies NAT gateway is healthy by conducting health checks. These health checks appear in NAT gateway's SNAT Connection Count metrics. The amount of health check related connections may vary as the health check service is optimized, but is negligible and doesnât impact NAT gatewayâs ability to connect outbound.
Datapath Availability
The datapath availability metric measures the health of the NAT gateway resource over time. This metric indicates if NAT gateway is available for directing outbound traffic to the internet. This metric is a reflection of the health of the Azure infrastructure.
You can use this metric to:
Monitor the availability of NAT gateway.

Alerts
Alerts can be configured in Azure Monitor for all NAT gateway metrics. These alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address potential issues with NAT gateway.
For more information about how metric alerts work, seeAzure Monitor Metric Alerts. The following guidance describes how to configure some common and recommended types of alerts for your NAT gateway.
Alerts for datapath availability degradation
Set up an alert on datapath availability to help you detect issues with the health of NAT gateway.
The recommended guidance is to alert on NAT gatewayâs datapath availability when it drops below 90% over a 15-minute period. This configuration is indicative of a NAT gateway resource being in a degraded state.
To set up a datapath availability alert, follow these steps:
From the NAT gateway resource page, selectAlerts.
From the NAT gateway resource page, selectAlerts.
SelectCreate alert rule.
SelectCreate alert rule.
From the signal list, selectDatapath Availability.

SelectCreateto create the alert rule.
Note
Aggregation granularity is the period of time over which the datapath availability is measured to determine if it has dropped below the threshold value.
Setting the aggregation granularity to less than 5 minutes may trigger false positive alerts that detect noise in the datapath.
Alerts for SNAT port exhaustion
Set up an alert on theSNAT Connection Countmetric to notify you of connection failures on your NAT gateway. A failed connection volume greater than zero can indicate that you reached the connection limit on your NAT gateway or that you hit SNAT port exhaustion. Investigate further to determine the root cause of these failures.
To create the alert, use the following steps:
From the NAT gateway resource page, selectAlerts.

Note
SNAT port exhaustion on your NAT gateway resource is uncommon. If you see SNAT port exhaustion, check if NAT gateway's idle timeout timer is set higher than the default amount of 4 minutes. A long idle timeout timer setting can cause SNAT ports too be in hold down for longer, which results in exhausting SNAT port inventory sooner. You can also scale your NAT gateway with additional public IPs to increase NAT gateway's overall SNAT port inventory. To troubleshoot these kinds of issues, refer to theNAT gateway connectivity troubleshooting guide.
Alerts for NAT gateway resource health
Azure Resource Healthprovides information on the health state of your NAT gateway resource. The resource health of your NAT gateway is evaluated by measuring the datapath availability of your NAT gateway endpoint. You can set up alerts to notify you when the health state of your NAT gateway resource changes. To learn more about NAT gateway resource health and setting up alerts, see:

Metrics FAQ
What type of metrics are available for NAT gateway?
The NAT gateway supportsmulti-dimensional metrics. You can filter the multi-dimensional metrics by different dimensions to gain greater insight into the provided data. TheSNAT Connection Countmetric allows you to filter the connections by Attempted and Failed connections, enabling you to distinguish between different types of connections made by the NAT gateway.
Refer to the dimensions column in themetrics overviewtable to see which dimensions are available for each NAT gateway metric.
How do I store NAT gateway metrics long-term?
Allplatform metrics are storedfor 93 days. If you require long term access to your NAT gateway metrics data, NAT gateway metrics can be retrieved by using themetrics REST API. For more information on how to use the API, see theAzure monitoring REST API walkthrough.
Note
Diagnostic Settingsdoesnât support the export of multi-dimensional metricsto another location, such as Azure Storage and Log Analytics.
To retrieve NAT gateway metrics, use the metrics REST API.
How do I interpret metrics charts?
