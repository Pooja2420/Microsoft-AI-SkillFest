Azure Monitorcan collect data directly from your hybrid machines into a Log Analytics workspace for detailed analysis and correlation. Typically, this would require installing theLog Analytics agenton the machine using a script, manually, or an automated method following your configuration management standards. Now, Azure Arc-enabled servers can install the Log Analytics and Dependency agentVM extensionfor Windows and Linux, enablingVM insightsto collect data from your non-Azure VMs.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
Enable and configure VM insights for your Linux or Windows non-azure VMs
Collect and view data from these VMs

Enable VM insights
Launch the Azure Arc service in the Azure portal by clickingAll services, then searching for and selectingMachines - Azure Arc.

In theCreate new rulepane, enter a name for your data collection rule. For this tutorial, leave the other options as is. Don't select an existing Log Analytics workspace if you already have one. Instead, select the default, which is a workspace with a unique name in the same region as your registered connected machine. This workspace is created and configured for you.Status messages display while the configuration is performed and extensions are installed on your connected machine. This process takes a few minutes.When the process is complete, a message displays that the machine has been onboarded and that Insights has been successfully deployed.

View data collected
After deployment and configuration are complete, selectInsights, and then select thePerformancetab. The Performance tab shows a select group of performance counters collected from the guest operating system of your machine. Scroll down to view more counters, and move the mouse over a graph to view average and percentiles taken starting from the time when the Log Analytics VM extension was installed on the machine.
