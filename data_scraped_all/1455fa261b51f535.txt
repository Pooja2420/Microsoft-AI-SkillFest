Note
Security reports are only available when you use the Azure Front Door premium tier.
Reports are free of charge. Most reports are based on access log data, but you don't need to enable access logs or make any configuration changes to use the reports.
How to access reports
Reports are accessible through the Azure portal and through the Azure Resource Manager API. You can alsodownload reports as comma-separated values (CSV) files.
Reports support any selected date range from the previous 90 days. With data points of every 5 mins, every hour, or every day based on the date range selected. Normally, you can view data with delay of within an hour and occasionally with delay of up to a few hours.

Key metrics included in all reports
The following metrics are used within the reports.
Traffic by domain report
Thetraffic by domainreport provides a grid view of all the domains under this Azure Front Door profile.

In this report, you can view:
Request counts
Data transferred out from Azure Front Door to client
Requests with status code (3XX, 4XX, and 5XX) of each domain
Domains include endpoint domains and custom domains.
You can go to other tabs to investigate further or view access log for more information if you find the metrics below your expectation.
Usage report
Theusage reportshows the trends of traffic and response status code by various dimensions.

The dimensions included in the usage report are:
Data transferred from edge to client and from origin to edge, in a line chart.
Data transferred from edge to client by protocol, in a line chart.
Number of requests from edge to clients, in a line chart.
Number of requests from edge to clients by protocol (HTTP and HTTPS), in a line chart.
Bandwidth from edge to client, in a line chart.
Total latency, which measures the total time from the client request received by Azure Front Door until the last response byte sent from Azure Front Door to the client, in a line chart.
Number of requests from edge to clients by HTTP status code, in a line chart. Every request generates an HTTP status code. HTTP status code appears as the HTTPStatusCode in the raw access log. The status code describes how the Azure Front Door edge PoP handled the request. For example, a 2XX status code indicates that the request was successfully served to a client. While a 4XX status code indicates that an error occurred.
Number of requests from the edge to clients by HTTP status code, in a line chart. The percentage of requests by HTTP status code is shown in a grid.
Traffic by location report
Thetraffic by locationreport displays:
The top 50 countries/regions of visitors that access your assets the most.
A breakdown of metrics by countries/regions and gives you an overall view of countries/regions where the most traffic gets generated.
The countries/regions that have higher cache hit ratios, and higher 4XX/5XX error code rates.

The following items are included in the reports:
A world map view of the top 50 countries/regions by data transferred out or requests of your choice.
Two line charts showing a trend view of the top five countries/regions by data transferred out and requests of your choice.
A grid of the top countries or regions with corresponding data transferred out from Azure Front Door to clients, the percentage of data transferred out, the number of requests, the percentage of requests by the country or region, cache hit ratio, 4XX response code counts, and 5XX response code counts.
Caching report
Thecaching reportprovides a chart view of cache hits and misses, and the cache hit ratio, based on requests. Understanding how Azure Front Door caches your content helps you to improve your application's performance because cache hits give you the fastest performance. You can optimize data delivery speeds by minimizing cache misses.

The caching report includes:
Cache hit and miss count trend, in a line chart.
Cache hit ratio, in a line chart.
Cache hits/misses describe the request number cache hits and cache misses for client requests.
Hits: client requests that get served directly from Azure Front Door edge PoPs. Refers to those requests whose values for CacheStatus in the raw access logs areHIT,PARTIAL_HIT, orREMOTE_HIT.
Miss: client requests that get served by Azure Front Door edge POPs fetching contents from origin. Refers to those requests whose values for the field CacheStatus in the raw access raw logs areMISS.
Cache hit ratiodescribes the percentage of cached requests that are served from edge directly. The formula of the cache hit ratio is:(PARTIAL_HIT +REMOTE_HIT+HIT/ (HIT + MISS + PARTIAL_HIT + REMOTE_HIT)*100%.
(PARTIAL_HIT +REMOTE_HIT+HIT/ (HIT + MISS + PARTIAL_HIT + REMOTE_HIT)*100%
Requests that meet the following requirements are included in the calculation:
The requested content was cached on an Azure Front Door PoP.
Partial cached contents forobject chunking.
It excludes all of the following cases:
Requests that are denied because of a Rule Set.
Requests that contain matching Rules Set, which is set to disable the cache.
Requests that get blocked by the Azure Front Door WAF.
Requests when the origin response headers indicate that they shouldn't be cached. For example, requests withCache-Control: private,Cache-Control: no-cache, orPragma: no-cacheheaders prevent the response from being cached.
Cache-Control: private
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Top URL report
Thetop URL reportallow you to view the amount of traffic incurred through a particular endpoint or custom domain. You see data for the most requested 50 assets during any period in the past 90 days.

Popular URLs are displayed with the following values:
URL, which refers to the full path of the requested asset in the format ofhttp(s)://contoso.com/index.html/images/example.jpg. URL refers to the value of the RequestUri field in the raw access log.
http(s)://contoso.com/index.html/images/example.jpg
Request counts.
Request counts as a percentage of the total requests served by Azure Front Door.
Data transferred.
Data transferred percentage.
Cache hit ratio percentage.
Requests with response codes of 4XX.
Requests with response codes of 5XX.
User can sort URLs by request count, request count percentage, data transferred, and data transferred percentage. The system aggregates all metrics by hour, and they might vary based on the selected time frame.
Note
Top URLs might change over time. To get an accurate list of the top 50 URLs, Azure Front Door counts all your URL requests by hour and keep the running total over the course of a day. The URLs at the bottom of the 50 URLs may rise onto or drop off the list over the day, so the total number of these URLs are approximations.
The top 50 URLs may rise and fall in the list, but they rarely disappear from the list, so the numbers for top URLs are usually reliable. When a URL drops off the list and rise up again over a day, the number of request during the period when they are missing from the list is estimated based on the request number of the URL that appear in that period.
Top referrer report
Thetop referrerreport shows you the top 50 referrers to a particular Azure Front Door endpoint or custom domain. You can view data for any period in the past 90 days. A referrer indicates the URL from which a request was generated. Referrer might come from a search engine or other websites. If a user types a URL (for example,https://contoso.com/index.html) directly into the address bar of a browser, the referrer for the requested isEmpty.
https://contoso.com/index.html

The top referrer report includes the following values.
Referrer, which is the value of the Referrer field in the raw access log.
Request counts.
Request count as a percentage of total requests served by Azure Front Door in the selected time period.
Data transferred.
Data transferred percentage.
Cache hit ratio percentage.
Requests with response code as 4XX.
Requests with response code as 5XX.
You can sort by request count, request %, data transferred and data transferred %. The system aggregates all metrics by hour, and they might vary based on the selected time frame.
Top user agent report
Thetop user agentreport shows graphical and statistics views of the top 50 user agents that were used to request content. The following list shows example user agents:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/86.0.4240.75
Safari/537.36.
A grid displays the request counts, request %, data transferred and data transferred, cache Hit Ratio %, requests with response code as 4XX and requests with response code as 5XX. User Agent refers to the value of UserAgent in access logs.
Note
Top user agents might change over time. To get an accurate list of the top 50 user agents, Azure Front Door counts all your user agent requests by hour and keep the running total over the course of a day. The user agents at the bottom of the 50 user agents may rise onto or drop off the list over the day, so the total number of these user agents are approximations.
The top 50 user agents may rise and fall in the list, but they rarely disappear from the list, so the numbers for top user agents are usually reliable. When a user agent drops off the list and rise up again over a day, the number of request during the period when they are missing from the list is estimated based on the request number of the user agents that appear in that period.
