This article describes the functionalities that are currently supported in Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB.
Azure Synapse support
There are two types of containers in Azure Cosmos DB:
HTAP container - A container with Synapse Link enabled. This container has both transactional store and analytical store.
OLTP container - A container with Synapse Link not enabled. This container has only transactional store and no analytical store.
You can connect to an Azure Cosmos DB container without enabling Synapse Link. In this scenario, you can only read/write to the transactional store. What follows is a list of the currently supported features within Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB.
If you write data into an Azure Cosmos DB container from Spark, this process happens through the transactional store of Azure Cosmos DB. It will impact the transactional performance of Azure Cosmos DB by consuming Request Units.
Dedicated SQL pool integration through external tables is currently not supported.
Supported code-generated actions for Spark
