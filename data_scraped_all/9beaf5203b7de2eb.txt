You can remove a project from Azure DevOps Server when the project is no longer required by using TFSDeleteProject.
In addition, if there are components that remain undeleted after an unsuccessful project creation, you can use TFSDeleteProject to remove them.
To delete a project from Azure DevOps Services using the admin console, seeDelete a project.
Warning
TFSDeleteProject permanently destroys the project, after which it cannot be recovered. You should backup all important project data before using TFSDeleteProject.
To access the TFSDeleteProject command-line tool, open a Command Prompt window and enter:
cd %programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer\TfsDeleteProject.exe
cd %programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer\TfsDeleteProject.exe
Prerequisites
To use theTFSDeleteProjectcommand, you must be a member of theTeam Foundation Administratorssecurity group or theProject Administratorssecurity group.
For more information, seeSet administrator permissions for Azure DevOps Server.

If you do not specify a virtual directory, you must use the following format for the URI:http://ServerName:Port/CollectionName.
http://ServerName:Port/CollectionName
TeamProjectName
Required. The name of the project. If the name includes spaces, enclose it in quotations marks.
Remarks
When you create a project, Azure DevOps Server creates data objects on the server that hosts Azure DevOps Server,
and may create data objects on the server that hosts SharePoint Products, and the server that hosts SQL Server Reporting Services.
When you remove a project, the reports are automatically removed from SQL Server Reporting Services.
When you remove a project, you can choose whether or not to remove the objects that were created to support the SharePoint site.
However, an error can prevent Azure DevOps Server from creating or deleting all the objects. To troubleshoot these problems,
the following sections provide background information, links to other resources, and specific steps that help you determine the cause of the problem,
fix the problem, and when necessary delete data objects that remain after running TFSDeleteProject.
TFSDeleteProject process
When you use the TFSDeleteProject command-line tool, it first deletes project data and then project Web sites.
Phase 1: TFSDeleteProject deletes project data
In the first phase, TFSDeleteProject automatically performs the following steps to remove project data:
TFSDeleteProject creates an inventory of all the components that are candidates for deletion.This includes components that integrate with Test Manager, Team Foundation Build, and Team Foundation version control.

This includes components that integrate with Test Manager, Team Foundation Build, and Team Foundation version control.
TFSDeleteProject deletes the component that displays the project node in Team Explorer.

TFSDeleteProject flags the version control information for deletion, but does not immediately delete this information.The information includes all version control branches in the specified project, but no other branches outside of the project.If a parent branch and a child branch are both in the project, TFSDeleteProject flags both for deletion.If parent and child branches are in different projects, TFSDeleteProject flags only the specified branch.If another project is a branch from the specified project, TFSDeleteProject flags only the specified project.
When the specified project is deleted, the branch project becomes an orphan.

If a parent branch and a child branch are both in the project, TFSDeleteProject flags both for deletion.
If parent and child branches are in different projects, TFSDeleteProject flags only the specified branch.
If another project is a branch from the specified project, TFSDeleteProject flags only the specified project.
When the specified project is deleted, the branch project becomes an orphan.
TFSDeleteProject immediately deletes build data, including information and core data, build definitions, build agents, and test results associated with the project. The tool does not delete build drop locations.You do not need to delete the build drop location of an old project before creating a project that uses the same build drop location.If the specified project contains a large amount of build data, the deletion might not finish within the timeout period.To work around this problem, see Increase the Time-Out Period, and then run TFSDeleteProject again.

Phase 2: TFSDeleteProject deletes project web sites
In the second phase, TFSDeleteProject deletes the following data:
Important
These steps can take a long time to complete, and during that time they can degrade server performance.
TFSDeleteProject Uses the Reporting Services APIs to delete reports on the server that hosts Reporting Services.
TFSDeleteProject Deletes the project portal Web site from the server that hosts SharePoint Products.
This step occurs only if the project owns the site and site deletion is not excluded in the command line.
(Consider that multiple projects may point to a single site, but only one of them can be the owner where reports/dashboards are by default using this project).
Note
Prior to deleting a project, you can confirm that Reporting Services and SharePoint Products
are using the correct project URLs by verifying the portal settings.
For more information, seeAdd a Project Portal.
If TFSDeleteProject successfully deletes all of the above data elements, it returns the message Done.
To verify this result, see Verify Project Components Are Deleted.
If one or more components are not removed, you can rerun TFSProjectDelete by using the /force option
to continue the deletion process even if it is unable to delete all data elements.
With this option TFSDeleteProject, skips a component that it cannot delete, returns an error message,
deletes the next component, and leaves the project metadata and security settings intact.
Data that may remain undeleted
The following data might remain in the deployment after TFSDeleteProject successfully completes:
Project data in the cube.Project data remains in the cube until the cube is rebuilt, at which time the warehouse controller service removes all of the historic build data that has been deleted from the Azure DevOps databases.

Build drop files and folders.Build binaries, build log files, and log files containing test results are published during the build process.The locations for these files are not deleted. If you want to remove these files, you must remove them manually.

Verify project deletion
You can verify the success of a project deletion by confirming that the project node no longer appears
in Team Explorer and that its project portal Web site and reports folders no longer exist.

Increase the time-out period
By default, each Web service call that the TFSDeleteProject command issues to delete a component must complete within 10 minutes. If there are six calls, then the process could take up to an hour. If you want to delete a project that is associated with a large amount of data, you can temporarily increase this time-out period.
Note
When you increase the time-out period, the change affects all Web service calls.
In general, you want to keep the time-out period to within 10 minutes to prevent
Web service calls from degrading server performance and causing users to be locked out
from using the user interface for long periods of time.
Therefore, after the project is successfully deleted, you should change the time-out period back to 10 minutes.

To complete these procedures, you must be a Windows Administrator on the application-tier server.
