Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
The Analytics service provides support for Azure DevOps reporting. It is available for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions.  It replaces the previous platform based on SQL Server Reporting Services.
With the release of Azure DevOps Server 2022, the only option for gaining Azure DevOps data insights is the Analytics service. Integration with SQL Server Reporting Services is no longer supported. For guidance on migrating from using SQL Reporting Services to Analytics, seeMigrate to Analytics from SQL Reporting Services for Azure DevOps.

Azure DevOps Server, TFS, and SQL Server Reporting
SinceTeam Foundation Server (TFS)was released in 2005, we've offered a reporting solutionbased on a data warehouse and OLAP cube, coupled witha SQL Server Reporting Services serverto host reports.

While the configuration is complex, it provides a powerful solution. You can create custom reports by writingcustomized SSRS reports. You can also create reportsusing Excel, and share them on SharePoint once you'veconfigured SharePoint to host Excel Charts.
We have no plans to bring a cloud version of our SQL Server Reporting story to Azure DevOps Services.
Future of SQL Server Reporting
The SQL Server Reporting Services platform is supported on all on-premises deployments from Azure DevOps Server 2020 and earlier versions.
Azure DevOps Server 2020 is the last version to support SQL Server Reporting. Future versions will support only Analytics. This plan allows customers time to convert their reports to Analytics.
