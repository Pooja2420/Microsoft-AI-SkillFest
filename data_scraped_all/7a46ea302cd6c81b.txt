Authentication is the process of proving the user is who they claim to be. Authentication activities can be logged withAzure SQL Auditing, and an IT administrator can configure reports and alerts whenever a login from a suspicious location is attempted.
Benefits
Some of the benefits of these robust authentication mechanisms include:
Strong password policies to deter brute force attacks.
User password encryption.
Firewall rules.
SQL endpoints withMulti-factor authentication.
Elimination of the need to manage credentials withmanaged identity.
Azure Synapse, dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), and serverless SQL pool currently supportMicrosoft Entra ID(Microsoft Entra ID) authentication andSQL authentication, while Apache Spark pool supports only Microsoft Entra authentication. Multi-factor authentication and managed identity are fully supported for Azure Synapse, dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), serverless SQL pool, and Apache Spark pool.
