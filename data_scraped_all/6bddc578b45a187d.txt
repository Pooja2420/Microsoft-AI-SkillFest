If the user is part of a Microsoft Entra user group, make sure the user group is a security group instead of a distribution group. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support Microsoft Entra distribution groups.

User loses existing feed and no remote resource is displayed (no feed)
This error usually appears after a user moved their subscription from one Microsoft Entra tenant to another. As a result, the service loses track of their user assignments, since those are still tied to the old Microsoft Entra tenant.
To resolve this, all you need to do is reassign the users to their application groups.
This could also happen if a CSP Provider created the subscription and then transferred to the customer. To resolve this, re-register the Resource Provider.
Sign in to the Azure portal.
Go toSubscription, and then select your subscription.
In the menu on the left side of the page, selectResource provider.
Find and selectMicrosoft.DesktopVirtualization, and then selectRe-register.
