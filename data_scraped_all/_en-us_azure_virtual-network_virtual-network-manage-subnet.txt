All Azure resources in a virtual network are deployed into subnets within the virtual network. This article explains how to add, change, or delete virtual network subnets by using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.

You can run the commands either in theAzure Cloud Shellor from Azure CLI on your computer.
Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. To run the commands in the Cloud Shell, selectOpen Cloud shellat the upper-right corner of a code block. SelectCopyto copy the code, and paste it into Cloud Shell to run it. You can also run the Cloud Shell from within the Azure portal.

You can also run the Cloud Shell from within the Azure portal.
If youinstall Azure CLI locallyto run the commands, you need Azure CLI version 2.31.0 or later. Runaz versionto find your installed version, and runaz upgradeto upgrade.Runaz loginto connect to Azure.

If youinstall Azure PowerShell locallyto run the commands, you need Azure PowerShell module version 5.4.1 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Azto find your installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeUpdate the Azure PowerShell module.Also make sure yourAz.Networkmodule is 4.3.0 or later. To verify the installed module, useGet-InstalledModule -Name Az.Network. To update, use the commandUpdate-Module -Name Az.Network.RunConnect-AzAccountto connect to Azure.

To do tasks on subnets, your account must be assigned to theNetwork contributor roleor to acustom roleassigned the appropriate actions in the following list:
Add a subnet
Portal
Azure CLI
PowerShell
In theAzure portal, search for and selectvirtual networks.
In theAzure portal, search for and selectvirtual networks.
On theVirtual networkspage, select the virtual network you want to add a subnet to.
On theVirtual networkspage, select the virtual network you want to add a subnet to.
On the virtual network page, selectSubnetsfrom the left navigation.
On the virtual network page, selectSubnetsfrom the left navigation.
On theSubnetspage, select+ Subnet.
On theSubnetspage, select+ Subnet.
On theAdd subnetscreen, enter or select values for the subnet settings.
On theAdd subnetscreen, enter or select values for the subnet settings.
SelectSave.
SelectSave.
Run theaz network vnet subnet createcommand with the options you want to configure.
az network vnet subnet create \
    --name <subnetName> \
    --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
    --vnet-name <virtualNetworkName>
az network vnet subnet create \
    --name <subnetName> \
    --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
    --vnet-name <virtualNetworkName>
Use theAdd-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfigcommand to configure the subnet.$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @vnetParams
$subnetParams = @{
   Name           = "<subnetName>"
   VirtualNetwork = $vnet
   AddressPrefix  = "<String[]>"
}
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnetParams
Use theAdd-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfigcommand to configure the subnet.
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @vnetParams
$subnetParams = @{
   Name           = "<subnetName>"
   VirtualNetwork = $vnet
   AddressPrefix  = "<String[]>"
}
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnetParams
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @vnetParams
$subnetParams = @{
   Name           = "<subnetName>"
   VirtualNetwork = $vnet
   AddressPrefix  = "<String[]>"
}
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnetParams
Then associate the subnet configuration to the virtual network withSet-AzVirtualNetwork.Set-AzVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
Then associate the subnet configuration to the virtual network withSet-AzVirtualNetwork.
Set-AzVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
Set-AzVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
You can configure the following settings for a subnet:
10.0.0.0/16
10.0.0.0/22
/29
Change subnet settings
Portal
Azure CLI
PowerShell
In theAzure portal, search for and selectvirtual networks.
On theVirtual networkspage, select the virtual network you want to change subnet settings for.
On the virtual network's page, selectSubnetsfrom the left navigation.
On theSubnetspage, select the subnet you want to change settings for.
On the subnet screen, change the subnet settings, and then selectSave.
Run theaz network vnet subnet updatecommand with the options you want to change.
az network vnet subnet update
az network vnet subnet update
Run theSet-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfigcommand with the options you want to change. Then set the configuration withSet-AzVirtualNetwork.
Set-AzVirtualNetwork
You can change the following subnet settings after the subnet is created:
0.0.0.0/0
Internet
VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint
Delete a subnet
Portal
Azure CLI
PowerShell
You can delete a subnet only if there are no resources in the subnet. If resources are in the subnet, you must delete those resources before you can delete the subnet. The steps you take to delete a resource vary depending on the resource. To learn how to delete the resources, see the documentation for each resource type.
In theAzure portal, search for and selectvirtual networks.
In theAzure portal, search for and selectvirtual networks.
On theVirtual networkspage, select the virtual network you want to delete a subnet from.
On theVirtual networkspage, select the virtual network you want to delete a subnet from.
On the virtual network's page, selectSubnetsfrom the left navigation.
On the virtual network's page, selectSubnetsfrom the left navigation.
On theSubnetspage, select the subnet you want to delete.
On theSubnetspage, select the subnet you want to delete.
SelectDelete, and then selectYesin the confirmation dialog box.
SelectDelete, and then selectYesin the confirmation dialog box.
Run theaz network vnet subnet deletecommand.
az network vnet subnet delete \
    --name <subnetName> \
    --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
    --vnet-name <virtualNetworkName>
az network vnet subnet delete \
    --name <subnetName> \
    --resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
    --vnet-name <virtualNetworkName>
Run theRemove-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfigcommand and then set the configuration.
$subnetParams = @{
  Name           = "<subnetName>"
  VirtualNetwork = $vnet
}
Remove-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnetParams | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
$subnetParams = @{
  Name           = "<subnetName>"
  VirtualNetwork = $vnet
}
Remove-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnetParams | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
