Some Azure REST operations run asynchronously because the operation can't be completed quickly. This article describes how to track the status of asynchronous operations through values returned in the response.
Status codes for asynchronous operations
An asynchronous operation initially returns an HTTP status code of either:
201 (Created)
202 (Accepted)
However, that status code doesn't necessarily mean the operation is asynchronous. An asynchronous operation also returns a value forprovisioningStatethat indicates the operation isn't finished. The value can vary by operation but doesn't includeSucceeded,Failed, orCanceled. Those three values indicate the operation finished. If no value is returned forprovisioningState, the operation finished and succeeded.
provisioningState
provisioningState
When the operation successfully completes, it returns either:
200 (OK)
204 (No Content)
Refer to theREST API documentationto see the responses for the operation you're executing.
After getting the 201 or 202 response code, you're ready to monitor the status of the operation.
URL to monitor status
There are two different ways to monitor the status the asynchronous operation. You determine the correct approach by examining the header values that are returned from your original request. First, look for:
Azure-AsyncOperation- URL for checking the ongoing status of the operation. If your operation returns this value, use it to track the status of the operation.
Azure-AsyncOperation
Retry-After- The number of seconds to wait before checking the status of the asynchronous operation.
Retry-After
IfAzure-AsyncOperationisn't one of the header values, then look for:
Azure-AsyncOperation
Location- URL for determining when an operation is completed. Use this value only whenAzure-AsyncOperationisn't returned.
Location
Azure-AsyncOperation
Retry-After- The number of seconds to wait before checking the status of the asynchronous operation.
Retry-After
When theRetry-afterheader isn't returned,implement your own retry logic.
Retry-after
Note
Your REST client must accept a minimum URL size of 4 KB forAzure-AsyncOperationandLocation.

Permission for tracking async status
To track the status of an asynchronous operation, you need sufficient permission at the resource group level. If you only have permission at the resource level, you can start the operation but you can't track its status. Resource group-level permission is required because the URL for tracking status isn't scoped to the resource.
For example, to start a virtual machine, you need the Virtual Machine Contributor role for the resource group that contains the virtual machine. The URL for tracking a start request doesn't include the virtual machine in its path.
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/{region}/operations/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-12-01
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/{region}/operations/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-12-01
Azure-AsyncOperation request and response
If you have a URL from theAzure-AsyncOperationheader value, send a GET request to that URL. Use the value fromRetry-Afterto schedule how often to check the status. You get a response object that indicates the status of the operation. A different response is returned when checking the status of the operation with theLocationURL. For more information about the response from a location URL, seeCreate storage account (202 with Location and Retry-After).

Retry-After
Location
The response properties can vary but always include the status of the asynchronous operation.
{
    "status": "{status-value}"
}
{
    "status": "{status-value}"
}
The following example shows other values that might be returned from the operation:
{
    "id": "{resource path from GET operation}",
    "name": "{operation-id}",
    "status" : "Succeeded | Failed | Canceled | {resource provider values}",
    "startTime": "2017-01-06T20:56:36.002812+00:00",
    "endTime": "2017-01-06T20:56:56.002812+00:00",
    "percentComplete": {double between 0 and 100 },
    "properties": {
        /* Specific resource provider values for successful operations */
    },
    "error" : {
        "code": "{error code}",  
        "message": "{error description}"
    }
}
{
    "id": "{resource path from GET operation}",
    "name": "{operation-id}",
    "status" : "Succeeded | Failed | Canceled | {resource provider values}",
    "startTime": "2017-01-06T20:56:36.002812+00:00",
    "endTime": "2017-01-06T20:56:56.002812+00:00",
    "percentComplete": {double between 0 and 100 },
    "properties": {
        /* Specific resource provider values for successful operations */
    },
    "error" : {
        "code": "{error code}",  
        "message": "{error description}"
    }
}
The error object is returned when the status is Failed or Canceled. All other values are optional. The response you receive might look different than the example.
provisioningState values
Operations that create, update, or delete (PUT, PATCH, DELETE) a resource typically return aprovisioningStatevalue. When an operation completes, one of the following three values is returned:
provisioningState
Succeeded
Failed
Canceled
All other values indicate the operation is still running. The resource provider can return a customized value that indicates its state. For example, you receiveAcceptedwhen the request is received and running.
Example requests and responses
Start virtual machine (202 with Azure-AsyncOperation)
This example shows how to determine the status ofstart operation for virtual machines. The initial request is in the following format:
POST 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm-name}/start?api-version=2019-12-01
POST 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm-name}/start?api-version=2019-12-01
It returns status code 202. Among the header values, you see:
Azure-AsyncOperation : https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/{region}/operations/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-12-01
Azure-AsyncOperation : https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/{region}/operations/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-12-01
To check the status of the asynchronous operation, send another request to that URL.
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/{region}/operations/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-12-01
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/{region}/operations/{operation-id}?api-version=2019-12-01
The response body contains the status of the operation:
{
  "startTime": "2017-01-06T18:58:24.7596323+00:00",
  "status": "InProgress",
  "name": "9a062a88-e463-4697-bef2-fe039df73a02"
}
{
  "startTime": "2017-01-06T18:58:24.7596323+00:00",
  "status": "InProgress",
  "name": "9a062a88-e463-4697-bef2-fe039df73a02"
}
Deploy resources (201 with Azure-AsyncOperation)
This example shows how to determine the status ofdeployments operation for deploying resourcesto Azure. The initial request is in the following format:
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}?api-version=2020-06-01
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}?api-version=2020-06-01
It returns status code 201. The body of the response includes:
"provisioningState":"Accepted",
"provisioningState":"Accepted",
Among the header values, you see:
Azure-AsyncOperation: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/{deployment-name}/operationStatuses/{operation-id}?api-version=2020-06-01
Azure-AsyncOperation: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/{deployment-name}/operationStatuses/{operation-id}?api-version=2020-06-01
To check the status of the asynchronous operation, send another request to the operation URL.
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/{deployment-name}/operationStatuses/{operation-id}?api-version=2020-06-01
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/{deployment-name}/operationStatuses/{operation-id}?api-version=2020-06-01
The response body contains the status of the operation:
{
    "status": "Running"
}
{
    "status": "Running"
}
When the deployment is finished, the response contains:
{
    "status": "Succeeded"
}
{
    "status": "Succeeded"
}
Create storage account (202 with Location and Retry-After)
This example shows how to determine the status of thecreate operation for storage accounts. The initial request is in the following format:
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-name}?api-version=2019-06-01
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-name}?api-version=2019-06-01
The request body contains properties for the storage account:
{
    "location": "South Central US",
    "properties": {},
    "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS"
    },
    "kind": "Storage"
}
{
    "location": "South Central US",
    "properties": {},
    "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS"
    },
    "kind": "Storage"
}
It returns status code 202. Among the header values, you see the following two values:
Location: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/operations/{operation-id}?monitor=true&api-version=2019-06-01
Retry-After: 17
Location: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/operations/{operation-id}?monitor=true&api-version=2019-06-01
Retry-After: 17
After waiting for number of seconds specified inRetry-After, check the status of the asynchronous operation by sending another request to that URL.
Retry-After
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/operations/{operation-id}?monitor=true&api-version=2019-06-01
GET 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/operations/{operation-id}?monitor=true&api-version=2019-06-01
If the request is still running, you receive a status code 202. If the request is completed, your receive a status code 200. The body of the response contains the properties of the storage account that was created.
