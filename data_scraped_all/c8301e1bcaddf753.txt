This article describes available Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) images in Azure Marketplace and policies around their naming and retention.
For information on Red Hat support policies for all versions of RHEL, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle. For pricing details, seeLinux Virtual Machines Pricing.
Important
RHEL images currently available in Azure Marketplace support either bring your own subscription (BYOS) or pay-as-you-go licensing models. You can dynamically switch between BYOS and pay-as-you-go licensing throughAzure Hybrid Benefit.
Note: BYOS images are based on private plans and currently not supported in CSP subscriptions (seehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/private-plans#unlock-enterprise-deals-with-private-plans)
Note
For any problem related to RHEL images in Azure Marketplace, file a support ticket with Microsoft.
View images available in Azure
When you search forRed Hatin Azure Marketplace or when you create a resource in the Azure portal, you see only some of the available RHEL images. You can get the full set of available VM images by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, and API. To see the full set of available Red Hat images in Azure, use theaz vm image listcommand:
az vm image list --publisher RedHat --all --output table
az vm image list --publisher RedHat --all --output table
Naming convention
Azure organizes VM images by publisher, offer, SKU, and version. The combination ofPublisher:Offer:SKU:Versionis the image URN and uniquely identifies the image to be used.
Publisher:Offer:SKU:Version
For example,RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.1.20200318refers to a RHEL 8.1 LVM-partitioned image built on March 18, 2020.
RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.1.20200318
This command usesaz vm createto create a RHEL 8.1 VM.
az vm create --name RhelVM --resource-group TestRG --image RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.1.20200318
az vm create --name RhelVM --resource-group TestRG --image RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.1.20200318
The latest moniker
The Azure REST API allows use of the monikerlatestfor the version instead of the specific version. Usinglatestprovisions the latest available image for the given publisher, offer, and SKU.
latest
latest
For example,RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:latestrefers to the latest RHEL 8 family LVM-partitioned image available. The--no-waitparameter returns control to the command line while the create operation proceeds.
RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:latest
--no-wait
az vm create --name RhelVM --resource-group TestRG --image RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:latest --no-wait
az vm create --name RhelVM --resource-group TestRG --image RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:latest --no-wait
Note
In general, the comparison of versions to determine the latest follows the rules of theVersion.CompareTo Method. This image version comparison is done by comparing the values as aVersionobject, not as a string.
RHEL 7 image types
Note
As of June 30 2024, RHEL 7.9 entered end of life. For continued support, enable ELS as part of the Extended Life-cycle Support phase. SeeRHEL Extended Lifecycle Support.
Note
Unless otherwise indicated, all images are LVM partitioned and connect to regular RHEL repositories. That is, the repositories aren't Extended Update Support (EUS) and aren't Update Services for SAP (E4S). Going forward, we're moving to publishing only LVM-partitioned images but are open to feedback on this decision. For more information on Extended Update Support and Update Services for SAP, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle.
For RHEL 7.x images, there are a few different image types. The following table shows the different sets of images we offer. To see a full list, use the Azure CLI commandaz vm image list --publisher redhat --all.
az vm image list --publisher redhat --all
RHEL 8 image types
Note
Red Hat recommends using Grubby to configure kernel command line parameters in RHEL 8+. For more information, seeConfiguring kernel command-line parameters.
Details for RHEL 8 image types:
RHEL 9 image types

RHEL Extended Support add-ons
Extended Life-cycle Support
The Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) add-on is an optional subscription that enables critical and important security fixes for releases that have reached end of life. For more information, seeExtended Life-cycle Support Add-On.
ELS is currently only available for RHEL 6.10. For pay-as-you-go images, enable ELS by following the steps inRHEL Extended Lifecycle Support.
If you're running on an older version, an upgrade to RHEL 6.10 is required before you can enable ELS.
Extended Update Support
As of April 2019, RHEL images are available that are attached to the EUS repositories by default. For more information, seeRHEL Extended Update Support Overview.
Switching to EUS repositories is possible and is supported. For instructions on how to switch your VM to EUS and more information about EUS support end-of-life dates, seeRHEL EUS and version-locking RHEL VMs.
Note
EUS isn't supported on RHEL Extras. If you install a package that's usually available from the RHEL Extras channel, you can't do so while on EUS. For more information on the Red Hat Extras product life cycle, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Extras Product Life Cycle.
If you want to use images that are attached to EUS repositories, you should use the RHEL image that contains a RHEL minor version number in the SKU.
For example, you might see the following two RHEL 7.4 images available.
RedHat:RHEL:7-LVM:7.6.2019062414
RedHat:RHEL:7.6:7.6.2019102813
RedHat:RHEL:7-LVM:7.6.2019062414
RedHat:RHEL:7.6:7.6.2019102813
In this case,RedHat:RHEL:7.6:7.6.2019102813is attached to EUS repositories by default. The SKU value is 7.4. AndRedHat:RHEL:7-LVM:7.6.2019062414is attached to non-EUS repositories by default. The SKU value is 7-LVM.
RedHat:RHEL:7.6:7.6.2019102813
RedHat:RHEL:7-LVM:7.6.2019062414
To use regular (non-EUS) repositories, use an image that doesn't contain a minor version number in the SKU.
Information in the following table applies to RHEL images that are connected to EUS repositories.
Note
Currently, only RHEL 7.4 and later minor versions have EUS support. EUS is no longer supported for RHEL <=7.3.
For more information about RHEL EUS availability, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle.
Update Services for SAP
The latest RHEL for SAP images are connected to the Update Services for SAP Solutions subscriptions (E4S). For more information about E4S, seeUpdate Services for SAP Solutions.
Note
If you intend to update OS connected to E4S repositories to the latest version, you can enforce the latest available EUS minor-release in the/etc/yum/vars/releaseverfile without switching to non-EUS.
/etc/yum/vars/releasever
For information on RedHat EUS availability, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle.
For steps on how to enforce a minor version, seeHow to set a specific release version on RHUI. Steps outlined in that article also apply to RHEL8.* versions.
Images from the following offers created after December 2019 are connected to E4S repositories:
RHEL-SAP (RHEL for SAP)
RHEL-SAP-HA (RHEL for SAP with High Availability and Update Services)
Other available offers and SKUs
The full list of available offers and SKUs might include more images beyond what is listed in the previous table. An example isRedHat:rhel-ocp-marketplace:rhel74:7.4.1. These offers might be used to provide support for specific marketplace solutions, or they could be published for previews and testing purposes. They might be changed or removed at any time without warning. Don't use them unless either Microsoft or Red Hat publicly presents them.
RedHat:rhel-ocp-marketplace:rhel74:7.4.1
Publishing policy
Microsoft and Red Hat update images as new minor versions are released, as required to address specific common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) or for occasional configuration changes or updates. We strive to provide updated images as soon as possible within three business days following a release or availability of a CVE fix.
We update only the current minor release in a given image family. With the release of a newer minor version, we stop updating the older minor version. For example, with the release of RHEL 7.6, RHEL 7.5 images are no longer updated.
Note
Active Azure VMs provisioned from RHEL pay-as-you-go images are connected to the Azure RHUI and can receive updates and fixes as soon as they're released by Red Hat and replicated to the Azure RHUI. The timing is usually less than 24 hours following the official release by Red Hat. These VMs don't require a new published image for getting the updates. Customers have full control over when to initiate the update.
Image retention policy
Current policy is to keep all previously published images. We reserve the right to remove images that are known to cause problems of any kind. For example, images with incorrect configurations due to subsequent platform or component updates might be removed. Images that might be removed follow the current Azure Marketplace policy to provide notifications up to 30 days before image removal.
Network configuration
We are currently overriding the default cloud-init network configuration by setting "apply_network_config: false" to support RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 images and customers.
Note
From RHEL 10 onwards, images will use the default cloud-init configuration that leverages Azure's IMDS endpoint for network configuration.
We request that customers plan their VM configuration accordingly from RHEL 10 onwards.
