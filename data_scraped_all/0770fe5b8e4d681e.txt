In this article, learn how to move resources in a specific resource group to a different Azure region withAzure Resource Mover. In the resource group, you select the resources you want to move.
To move services and resources manually or to move services and resources that aren't supported by Azure Resource Mover, seeAzure services relocation guidance.
Prerequisites
You needOwneraccess on the subscription in which resources you want to move are located.The first time you add a resource for a  specific source and destination mapping in an Azure subscription, Resource Mover creates asystem-assigned managed identity(formerly known as Managed Service Identify (MSI)) that's trusted by the subscription.To create the identity, and to assign it the required role (Contributor or User Access administrator in the source subscription), the account you use to add resources needsOwnerpermissions on the subscription.Learn moreabout Azure roles.

The subscription needs enough quota to create the source resources in the target region. If it doesn't, request additional limits.Learn more.
Verify pricing and charges associated with the target region to which you're moving VMs. Use thepricing calculatorto help you.

Select resources to move
Select resources you want to move. You move resources to a target region in the source region subscription. If you want to change the subscription, you can do that after the resources are moved.
Note
Don't select associated disks or the operation will fail. Associated disks are automatically included in a VM move.

Resolve dependencies
Resources you're moving appear in theAcross regionspage, in aPrepare pendingstate. Start validation as follows:
Dependencies are validated in the background after you add them. If you see aValidate dependenciesbutton, select it to trigger the manual validation.

Move the source resource group
Before you can prepare and move resources, the source resource group must be present in the target region.
Prepare to move the source resource group
Prepare as follows:
InAcross regions, select the source resource group >Prepare.
InAcross regions, select the source resource group >Prepare.
InPrepare resources, selectPrepare.During the Prepare process, Resource Mover generates Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates using the resource group settings. Resources inside the resource group aren't affected.

Note
After preparing the resource group, it's in theInitiate move pendingstate. Refresh to show the latest state.
Move the source resource group
Initiate the move as follows:
InAcross regions, select the resource group >Initiate Move
InAcross regions, select the resource group >Initiate Move
lnMove Resources, selectInitiate move. The resource group moves into anInitiate move in progressstate.
lnMove Resources, selectInitiate move. The resource group moves into anInitiate move in progressstate.
After initiating the move, the target resource group is created, based on the generated ARM template. The source resource group moves into aCommit move pendingstate.
After initiating the move, the target resource group is created, based on the generated ARM template. The source resource group moves into aCommit move pendingstate.

To commit and finish the move process:
InAcross regions, select the resource group >Commit move
lnMove Resources, selectCommit.
Note
After committing the move, the source resource group is in aDelete source pendingstate.
Modify target settings
If you don't want to move a source resource, you can do either of the following:
Create a resource in the target region with the same name and settings as the resource in the source region.
Create a new equivalent resource in the target region. Except for the settings you specify, the target resource is created with the same settings as the source.
Use an existing resource in the target region.
Modify a setting as follows:
To modify a setting, select the entry in theDestination configurationcolumn for the resource.
In theDestination configurationpage, specify the target settings you want to use.
Changes are only made for the resource you're editing. You need to  update any dependent resources separately.
The exact settings you modify depend on the resource type.Learn moreabout editing target settings.
Prepare resources to move
Now that the source resource group is moved, you can prepare to move the other resources.
InAcross regions, select the resources you want to prepare.
InAcross regions, select the resources you want to prepare.

SelectPrepare.
SelectPrepare.
Note
During the prepare process, the Azure Site Recovery Mobility agent is installed on VMs, for replication.
VM data is replicated periodically to the target region. This doesn't affect the source VM.
Resource Move generates ARM templates for the other source resources.
After preparing resources, they're in anInitiate move pendingstate.
Initiate the move
With resources prepared, you can now initiate the move.
InAcross regions, select resources with stateInitiate move pending. Then selectInitiate move.
InAcross regions, select resources with stateInitiate move pending. Then selectInitiate move.
InMove resources, selectInitiate move.
InMove resources, selectInitiate move.

Track move progress in the notifications bar.
Track move progress in the notifications bar.
Note
For VMs, replica VMs are created in the target region. The source VM is shut down, and some downtime occurs (usually minutes).
Resource Mover recreates other resources using the ARM templates that were prepared. There's usually no downtime.
For load balancers, NAT rules aren't copied. Create them in the target region after you commit the move.
For public IP addresses, the DNS name label isn't copied. Recreate the label after you commit the move.
After preparing resources, they're in anCommit move pendingstate.
Discard or commit?
After the initial move, you can decide whether you want to commit the move, or to discard it.
Discard: You might discard a move if you're testing, and you don't want to actually move the source resource. Discarding the move returns the resource to a state ofInitiate move pending.
Commit: Commit completes the move to the target region. After committing, a source resource will be in a state ofDelete source pending, and you can decide if you want to delete it.
Discard the move
You can discard the move as follows:
InAcross regions, select resources with stateCommit move pending, and selectDiscard move.
InDiscard move, selectDiscard.
Track move progress in the notifications bar.
When the notifications show that the move was successful, selectRefresh.
Note
For VMs, After discarding resources, they're in anInitiate move pendingstate.
Commit the move
If you want to complete the move process, commit the move.
InAcross regions, select resources with stateCommit move pending, and selectCommit move.
InAcross regions, select resources with stateCommit move pending, and selectCommit move.
InCommit resources, selectCommit.
InCommit resources, selectCommit.

Track the commit progress in the notifications bar.
Track the commit progress in the notifications bar.
Note
After committing the move, VMs stop replicating. The source VM isn't impacted by the commit.
Commit doesn't impact source networking resources.
After committing the move, resources are in aDelete source pendingstate.
Configure settings after the move
Since DNS name labels aren't copied over for public IP addresses, after the move is done, navigate to the target resources and update the label.
For internal load balancers, since NAT rules aren't copied over, navigate to the resources created in the target region, and update the NAT rules.
The Mobility service isn't uninstalled automatically from VMs. Uninstall it manually, or leave it if you plan to move the server again.
Delete source resources after commit
After the move, you can optionally delete resources in the source region.
InAcross Regions, select the name of each source resource that you want to delete.
In the properties page for each resource, selectDelete.
Delete additional resources created for move
After the move, you can manually delete the move collection, and Site Recovery resources that were created.
The move collection is hidden by default. To see it you need to turn on hidden resources.
The cache storage has a lock that must be deleted, before it can be deleted.
Delete as follows:
Locate the resources in resource groupRegionMoveRG-<sourceregion>-<target-region>, in the source region.
Locate the resources in resource groupRegionMoveRG-<sourceregion>-<target-region>, in the source region.
RegionMoveRG-<sourceregion>-<target-region>
Check that all the VM and other source resources in the move collection have been moved/deleted. This ensures that there are no pending resources using them.
