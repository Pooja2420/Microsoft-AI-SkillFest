Use Azure NetApp Files to deploy IBM Power in Skytap on Azure
Skytap on Azureis a cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) that you can use to runIBM Powerworkloads such as AIX, IBM i (AS/400), and Linux on Power together with x86 workloads natively on Azure. Skytap doesn't require refactoring, rearchitecting, or replatforming, so you can easily move traditional workloads to Azure.
If you deploy Skytap on Azure, useAzure NetApp Filesfor file storage. You can scale storage allocations up or down at any time without service interruptions. You can also dynamically adjust storage service-level performance requirements.

Azure VPN Gatewayconnects your on-premises networks to Azure through site-to-site VPNs in a process similar to the one that you use to set up and connect to a remote branch office. This configuration provides secure connections that use the industry-standard protocols Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).

Scenario details
Potential use cases
You can use Azure NetApp Files for scenarios that need network file storage in the cloud and for the following use cases:
Scalable and resilient file share service: A scalable and resilient file share service is a robust storage solution that can grow alongside your data needs and keep your information safe. Use a file share service to add storage capacity in real time when you need it to improve performance. You can also incorporate replication for built-in data resiliency to ensure that data is always accessible. Azure NetApp Files provides a reliable and adaptable platform for sharing and storing your mission-critical workload files that are hosted on the IBM Power platform.

Centralized data storage: You can use Azure NetApp Files to create a shared storage pool that multiple AIX systems can access through Network File System (NFS). This shared storage pool includes user home directories, application data, or project files across your network. You often use a shared storage pool for distributed applications.

SAP global transport directory: TheSAP global transport directory(/usr/sap/trans) is a shared location that resides on the global domain controller of an SAP transport management system (TMS). Depending on requirements, you might have one global transport directory or multiple transport directories. You can use this directory as an NFS share that's hosted in the Azure cloud on Azure NetApp Files. Use the directory to share files with multiple clients across a network. Azure NetApp Files provides resiliency and performance in this scenario.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeWell-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability helps ensure that your application can meet the commitments that you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Skytap on Azure provides a standard 99.95% availability service-level objective (SLO) for the platform and logical partitions (LPARs).
Azure NetApp Files provides astandard 99.99% availability service-level agreement (SLA)for all tiers and supported regions. Azure NetApp Files also supports provisioning volumes inavailability zonesthat you choose, and supports HA deployments across zones for added data protection if there's a zone outage.
For improved recovery point objective and recovery time objective (RPO/RTO) SLAs, integrated data protection withsnapshotsandbackupare available with the service. Additionally,cross-region replicationprovides disaster recovery benefits across Azure regions.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
Azure NetApp Files provides an extra level of security by keepingvolumes and data traffic within your virtual networksand not providing a publicly addressable endpoint. Alldata is encrypted at restalways. You can also useNFS Kerberosto encrypt data in transit.
Azure NetApp Files provides support for standard NFSv4.1 security measures, such as name strings, limited firewall port exposure,LDAP integration, andNFSv4.1 ACLs.
TheAzure Policycan help you enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale. Azure NetApp Files supports Azure Policy throughcustom and built-in policy definitions.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization focuses on ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
Understand theAzure NetApp Files cost modelto help you manage your cloud spend.
Billing for Azure NetApp Files is based on provisioned storage capacity, which you allocate by creating capacity pools.
If your capacity pool size requirements fluctuate, consider resizing your volumes and capacity pools to balance cost with your variable capacity and performance needs. You can resize with no disruption to your workloads.
If your capacity pool size requirements are consistent but performance requirements fluctuate, consider dynamically changing theservice levelof a volume. Azure NetApp Files has multiple service levels to provide the best blend of performance to cost optimization for your cloud needs. For instance, if your workloads are busy only at certain times in the quarter, apply the Premium or Ultra service levels to maximize your performance. Or if your workload occasionally goes stagnant, nondisruptively adjust the service level of the volume to Standard to reduce costs.
Azure NetApp Files has a Standard storage service level withcool access. You can use this feature to tier cold data and reduce object storage cost. Cool access automatically moves cold blocks to Azure Blob storage and automatically returns them to the active file system when a client requests them.
You can also provision and deprovision various types of capacity pools throughout the month to provide just-in-time performance and reduce costs during periods when you don't need high performance.
Determine which Azure NetApp Files service level (Standard, Premium, or Ultra) that you need based on your capacity and performance requirements. Use theAzure Pricing calculatorto evaluate the costs for these components:

Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
Azure NetApp Files offers the ability to dynamically scale up performance service levels or scale down performanceservice levelswithout disruption as your workload needs change.
Service levels include:
Standard: 16MiB/s per 1 TiB
Premium: 64MiB/s per 1 TiB
Ultra: 128MiB/s per 1 TiB
If you need more performance than the capacity permits, consider setting themanual Quality of Service (QoS)type on the capacity pool to maximize the allowed throughput on the volume.
Use Azure NetApp Files to control costs based on required performance for your application workload.
For requirements related to your throughput and capacity, see:

To scale compute performance, you can add capacity to LPARs that run in Skytap on Azure. You can also dynamically scale storage for Azure NetApp Files volumes.Automatic QoSautomatically scales performance. For more granular control of each volume, usemanual QoSto control the performance of each volume separately for your capacity pools.
Azure NetApp Files volumes are available inUltra, Premium, and Standard performance tiers. When you choose the tier that best suits your performance requirements, consider that available performance bandwidthscales with the size of a volume. You canchange the service level of a volumeat any time without disruption to storage operations. For more information about the Azure NetApp Files cost model, seePricing examples.
