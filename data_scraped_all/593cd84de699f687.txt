This section expands on the network topology to consider recommended models for connecting on-premises locations to Azure.
Design considerations:
AzureExpressRouteprovides dedicated private connectivity to Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) functionality from on-premises locations.

When multiple virtual networks are connected to the same ExpressRoute circuit, they'll become part of the samerouting domain, and all virtual networks will share the bandwidth.

You can use ExpressRouteGlobal Reach, where available, to connect on-premises locations together through ExpressRoute circuits to transit traffic over the Microsoft backbone network.

ExpressRoute Directallows creation of multiple ExpressRoute circuits at no additional cost, up to the ExpressRoute Direct port capacity (10 Gbps or 100 Gbps). It also allows you to connect directly to Microsoft's ExpressRoute routers. For the 100-Gbps SKU, the minimum circuit bandwidth is 5 Gbps. For the 10-Gbps SKU, the minimum circuit bandwidth is 1 Gbps.

When enabled on an ExpressRoute circuit,FastPathsends network traffic directly to virtual machines in the virtual network, bypassing the gateway. FastPath is designed to improve the data path performance between your on-premises network and your virtual network without having a bottleneck on the gateway.

Design recommendations:
Use ExpressRoute as the primary connectivity channel for connecting an on-premises network to Azure. You can useVPNs as a source of backup connectivityto enhance connectivity resiliency.

Use dual ExpressRoute circuits from different peering locations when you're connecting an on-premises location to virtual networks in Azure. This setup will ensure redundant paths to Azure by removing single points of failure between on-premises and Azure.

When you use multiple ExpressRoute circuits,optimize ExpressRoute routing via BGP local preference and AS PATH prepending.

Use VPN gateways to connect branches or remote locations to Azure. For higher resilience, deployzone-redundant gateways. See theretirement announcementof VpnGw1â5 (non-availability zones SKUs) for more information on new, existing deployments, pricing and migration guidance.

When traffic isolation or dedicated bandwidth is required, such as for separating production and nonproduction environments, use different ExpressRoute circuits. It will help you ensure isolated routing domains and alleviate noisy-neighbor risks.

Use ExpressRoutenetwork insightsto monitor your ExpressRoute components (peerings, connections, gateways). ExpressRoute uses network insights to provide a detailed topology mapping of all ExpressRoute components (peerings, connections, gateways) and has preloaded metrics dashboard for availability, throughput, packet drops, and gateway metrics.UseConnection Monitor for ExpressRouteto monitor connectivity between Azure cloud deployments and on-premises locations (branch offices, and so on.), detect network issues, identify and eliminate connectivity problems.

Don't explicitly use ExpressRoute circuits from a single peering location. This creates a single point of failure and makes your organization susceptible to peering location outages.
