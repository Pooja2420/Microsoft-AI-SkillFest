Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore provides seamless scalability and high availability. This document serves as a quick guide for developers who want to learn how to scale and configure their clusters. Changes to the cluster are performed live without downtime.
Prerequisites
An existing Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.If you don't have an Azure subscription,create an account for free.If you have an existing Azure subscription,create a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.

Navigate to the scale section
To change the configuration of your cluster, use theScalesection of the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster page in the Azure portal. The portal includes real-time costs for these changes.

Change the cluster tier
The cluster tier you select influences the amount of vCores and RAM assigned to your cluster. You can change the cluster tier to suit your needs at any time without downtime. For example, you can increase fromM50toM60or decreaseM50toM40using the Azure portal.
To change the cluster tier, select the new tier from the drop-down menu.NoteThis change is performed live to the cluster without downtime.Upgrade or downgrade from burstable tiers to memory optimized tier isn't supported at the moment.

Increase disk size
You can increase the storage size to give your database more room to grow. For example, you can increase the storage from128 GBto256 GB.
To increase the storage size, select the new size from the drop-down menu.NoteThis change is performed live to the cluster without downtime. Also, storage size can only be increased, not decreased.

Enable or disable high availability
You can enable or disablehigh availability (HA)to suit your needs. HA avoids database downtime by maintaining replica shards of every primary shard in a cluster. If a primary shard goes down, incoming connections are automatically redirected to its replica shard, ensuring that there's minimal downtime.
To enable or disable HA, toggle the checkbox option.

Next steps
In this guide, we've shown that scaling and configuring your Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster in the Azure portal is a straightforward process. The Azure portal includes the ability to adjust the cluster tier, increase storage size, and enable or disable high availability without any downtime.
