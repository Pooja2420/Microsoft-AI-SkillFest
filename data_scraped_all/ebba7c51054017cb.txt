Each data factory is tied to exactly one Azure subscription.
Object names must start with a letter or a number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or a number. Consecutive dashes aren't permitted in container names.
Name can be 3-63 characters long.
Object names must start with a letter.
The following characters aren't allowed: â.â, â+â, â?â, â/â, â<â, â>â,â*â,â%â,â&â,â:â,â\â
Dashes ("-") aren't allowed in the names of linked services, data flows, and datasets.

Validation check on parameter names and variable names is limited to uniqueness because of backward compatibility reason.
When use parameters or variables to reference entity names, for example linked service, the entity naming rules apply.
A good practice is to follow data flow transformation naming rules to name your pipeline parameters and variables.
