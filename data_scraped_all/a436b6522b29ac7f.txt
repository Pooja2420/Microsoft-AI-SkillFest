Deploy a chat model
To work with a model, you first deploy it into a project. If you don't yet have a project, you create one as part of the deployment step.

Once the model is deployed, selectOpen in playgroundto test your model.
You're now in a project, with a deployed model. You can use the chat playground to interact with your model.
For more information about deploying models, seehow to deploy models.
Chat in the playground without your data
In theAzure AI Foundryplayground, you can observe how your model responds with and without your data. In this quickstart, you test your model without your data.
To chat with your deployed model in the chat playground, follow these steps:
In theSystem messagetext box, provide this prompt to guide the assistant: "You're an AI assistant that helps people find information." You can tailor the prompt for your scenario.

The assistant either replies that it doesn't know the answer or provides a generic response. For example, the assistant might say, "The price of TrailWalker hiking shoes can vary depending on the brand, model, and where you purchase them."
