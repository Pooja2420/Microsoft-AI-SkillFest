This article compares the following Microsoft cloud services:
Microsoft Power Automate(was Microsoft Flow)
Azure Logic Apps
Azure Functions
Azure App Service WebJobs
All of these services can solve integration problems and automate business processes. They can all define input, actions, conditions, and output. You can run each of them on a schedule or trigger. Each service has unique advantages, and this article explains the differences.
Note
If you're looking for a more general comparison between Azure Functions and other Azure compute options, see the following articles:

Compare Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft Power Automate
These services are bothdesigner-firstintegration platforms where you can build and run automated workflows. Both platforms integrate with various Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and enterprise applications. Both provide similar workflow designers, and whiletheir connectors share some overlap, each platform also offers their own unique connectors.
Power Automate empowers business users, office workers, and citizen developers to build simple integrations without having to work with IT or developers or to write code. One example might be an approval workflow for a SharePoint document library. Azure Logic Apps supports integrations ranging from little-to-no-code scenarios to more advanced, codeful, and complex workflows. Examples include B2B processes or scenarios that require enterprise-level interactions with Azure DevOps. A business workflow can also grow from simple to complete over time.
To help you determine whether you want to use Azure Logic Apps or Power Automate for a specific integration, see theCapability comparison table.
Compare Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps
These Azure services enable you to build and run serverless workloads. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, while Azure Logic Apps is a serverless workflow integration platform. Both can create complexorchestrations. An orchestration is a collection of functions, which are calledactionsin Azure Logic Apps, that you can run to complete a complex task. For example, to process a batch of orders, you might execute many instances of a function in parallel, wait for all instances to finish, and then execute a function that computes a result on the aggregate.
For Azure Functions, you develop orchestrations by writing code and using theDurable Functions extension. For Azure Logic Apps, you create orchestrations by using a visual designer or by editing Azure Resource Manager templates.
You can mix and match services when you build an orchestration. For example, you can call functions from logic app workflows and call logic app workflows from functions. Choose how to build each orchestration based on the services' capabilities or your personal preference. The following table lists some key differences between these services:

Compare Functions and WebJobs
Like Azure Functions, Azure App Service WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK is acode-firstintegration service that is designed for developers. Both are built onAzure App Serviceand support features such assource control integration,authentication, andmonitoring with Application Insights integration.
WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK
You can use theWebJobsfeature of App Service to run a script or code in the context of an App Service web app. TheWebJobs SDKis a framework designed for WebJobs that simplifies the code you write to respond to events in Azure services. For example, you might respond to the creation of an image blob in Azure Storage by creating a thumbnail image. The WebJobs SDK runs as a .NET console application, which you can deploy to a WebJob.
WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK work best together, but you can use WebJobs without the WebJobs SDK and vice versa. A WebJob can run any program or script that runs in the App Service sandbox. A WebJobs SDK console application can run anywhere console applications run, such as on-premises servers.
Comparison table
Azure Functions is built on the WebJobs SDK, so it shares many of the same event triggers and connections to other Azure services. Here are some factors to consider when you're choosing between Azure Functions and WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK:
1WebJobs (without the WebJobs SDK) supports languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript, Bash, .cmd, .bat, PowerShell, PHP, TypeScript, Python, and more. A WebJob can run any program or script that can run in the App Service sandbox.
2WebJobs (without the WebJobs SDK) supports npm and NuGet.
Summary
Azure Functions offers more developer productivity than Azure App Service WebJobs does. It also offers more options for programming languages, development environments, Azure service integration, and pricing. For most scenarios, it's the best choice.
Here are two scenarios for which WebJobs might be the best choice:
You need more control over the code that listens for events, theJobHostobject. Functions offers a limited number of ways to customizeJobHostbehavior in thehost.jsonfile. Sometimes you need to do things that you can't specify by using a string in a JSON file. For example, only the WebJobs SDK lets you configure a custom retry policy for Azure Storage.
JobHost
JobHost
You have an App Service app for which you want to run code snippets, and you want to manage them together in the same Azure DevOps environment.
For other scenarios where you want to run code snippets for integrating Azure or external services, choose Azure Functions over WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK.

Power Automate, Logic Apps, Functions, and WebJobs together
You don't have to choose just one of these services. They integrate with each other and with external services.
A Power Automate flow can call an Azure Logic Apps workflow. An Azure Logic Apps workflow can call a function in Azure Functions, and vice versa. For example, seeCreate a function that integrates with Azure Logic Apps.
Between Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, and Functions, the integration experience between these services continues to improve over time. You can build a component in one service and use that component in the other services.
