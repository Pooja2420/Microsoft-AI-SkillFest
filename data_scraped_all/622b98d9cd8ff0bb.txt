Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâs globally distributed, multi-model database. Azure Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azureâs geographic regions. It offers throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees with comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs). Azure Cosmos DB provides APIs for the following data models, with SDKs available in multiple languages:
SQL API
MongoDB API
Cassandra API
Graph (Gremlin) API
Table API
This article explains how to read data from and write data to Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Databricks. For more the most up-to-date details about Azure Cosmos DB, seeAccelerate big data analytics by using the Apache Spark to Azure Cosmos DB connector.
