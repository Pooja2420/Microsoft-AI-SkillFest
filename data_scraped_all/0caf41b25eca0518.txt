File integrity monitoringin Defender for Servers Plan 2 uses the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent to collect data from machines according to collection rules.
The previous version of file integrity monitoring used the Log Analytics agent (also known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)) or the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) for data collection. This article describes how to migrate previous versions of MMA and AMA to the new version.
Prerequisites
You must enable Defender for Servers Plan 2 to use file integrity monitoring.
Migration is relevant if file integrity monitoring is currently enabled using MMA or AMA.
Machines protected by Defender for Servers Plan 2 must run the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent. To check agent status on machines in your environment,use this workbookto do that.
Migrate from MMA
If you use a previous version of file integrity monitoring with MMA, you might migrate using the in-product migration experience. With the in-product experience, you can:
Review the current environment before migrating.
Export current file integrity monitoring rules that use MMA in a Log Analytics workspace.
Migrate to the new experience if Defender for Servers Plan 2 is active.
Before you start
Note that:
You can only run the migration tool once per subscription. You can't run it again to migrate rules from multiple workspaces in the same subscription.
The in-product migration requires Security Admin permissions on the target subscription and Owner permissions on the target Log Analytics workspace.
The tool lets you transfer existing monitoring rules to the new experience.
You can't migrate custom and legacy built-in rules that aren't part of the new experience, but you can export them to a JSON file.
The migration tool lists all the machines in a subscription, not just those onboarded to file integrity monitoring with MMA.The legacy version required MMA connected to the Log Analytics workspace. Machines protected by Defender for Servers Plan 2 but not running MMA didn't benefit from file integrity monitoring.With the new experience, all machines in the enabled scope benefit from file integrity monitoring.

With the new experience, all machines in the enabled scope benefit from file integrity monitoring.
Although the new experience doesn't need an MMA agent, you must specify a source and target workspace in the migration tool.The source is the workspace from which you transfer existing rules into the new experience.The target is the workspace where change logs are written when monitored files and registries change.

After enabling the new experience on a subscription, machines in the enabled scope are covered by the same file integrity monitoring rules.

After the migration finishes, the subscription is removed from the migration wizard, and migrated file integrity monitoring rules are applied.
Disable the legacy MMA solution
Follow these steps to disable file integrity monitoring with MMA manually.
Remove the Azure ChangeTracking solutionfrom the Log Analytics workspace.After removal, no new file integrity monitoring events are collected. Historical events remain stored in the relevant Log Analytics workspace under theChange Trackingsection in theConfigurationChangetable. Events are stored according to theworkspace data retention settings.

If you no longer need MMA on machines, disable the use of the Log Analytics agent.If you don't need the agent on any machines,turn off automatic agent provisioningin the subscription.For a specific machine, remove the agent using theAzure Monitor Discovery and Removal Utility.
