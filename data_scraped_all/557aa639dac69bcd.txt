Azure Cache for Redis metrics
The following list provides details and more information about the supported Azure Monitor metrics forMicrosoft.Cache/redisandMicrosoft.Cache/redisEnterprise.
99th Percentile Latency (preview)Depicts the worst-case (99th percentile) latency of server-side commands. Measured by issuingPINGcommands from the load balancer to the Redis server and tracking the time to respond.Useful for tracking the health of your Redis instance. Latency increases if the cache is under heavy load or if there are long running commands that delay the execution of thePINGcommand.This metric is only available in Standard and Premium tier caches.

This metric is only available in Standard and Premium tier caches.
Cache Latency (preview)The latency of the cache calculated using the internode latency of the cache. This metric is measured in microseconds, and has three dimensions:Avg,Min, andMax. The dimensions represent the average, minimum, and maximum latency of the cache during the specified reporting interval.

Cache MissesThe number of failed key lookups during the specified reporting interval. This number maps tokeyspace_missesfrom the Redis INFO command. Cache misses don't necessarily mean there's an issue with the cache. For example, when using the cache-aside programming pattern, an application looks first in the cache for an item. If the item isn't there (cache miss), the item is retrieved from the database and added to the cache for next time. Cache misses are normal behavior for the cache-aside programming pattern. If the number of cache misses is higher than expected, examine the application logic that populates and reads from the cache. If items are being evicted from the cache because of memory pressure, then there might be some cache misses, but a better metric to monitor for memory pressure would beUsed MemoryorEvicted Keys.

Cache ReadThe amount of data read from the cache in Megabytes per second (MB/s) during the specified reporting interval. This value is derived from the network interface cards that support the virtual machine that hosts the cache and isn't Redis specific. This value corresponds to the network bandwidth used by this cache. If you want to set up alerts for server-side network bandwidth limits, then create it using thisCache Readcounter. Seethis tablefor the observed bandwidth limits for various cache pricing tiers and sizes.

Connected ClientsThe number of client connections to the cache during the specified reporting interval. This number maps toconnected_clientsfrom the Redis INFO command. Once the [connection limit]/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-configure.md#default-redis-server-configuration) is reached, later attempts to connect to the cache fail. Even if there are no active client applications, there might still be a few instances of connected clients because of internal processes and connections.

Connected Clients Using Microsoft Entra Token (preview)The number of client connections to the cache authenticated using Microsoft Entra token during the specified reporting interval.
Connected Clients Using Microsoft Entra Token (preview)
The number of client connections to the cache authenticated using Microsoft Entra token during the specified reporting interval.
Connections Created Per SecondThe number of instantaneous connections created per second on the cache via port 6379 or 6380 (SSL). This metric can help identify whether clients are frequently disconnecting and reconnecting, which can cause higher CPU usage and Redis Server Load. This metric isn't available in Enterprise or Enterprise Flash tier caches.

CPUThe CPU utilization of the Azure Cache for Redis server as a percentage during the specified reporting interval. This value maps to the operating system\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Timeperformance counter. Note that this metric can be noisy due to low priority background security processes running on the node, so we recommend monitoring Server Load metric to track load on a Redis server.

Geo-replication metricsGeo-replication metrics are affected by monthly internal maintenance operations. The Azure Cache for Redis service periodically patches all caches with the latest platform features and improvements. During these updates, each cache node is taken offline, which temporarily disables the geo-replication link. If your geo replication link is unhealthy, check to see if it was caused by a patching event on either the geo-primary or geo-secondary cache by usingDiagnose and Solve Problemsfrom the Resource menu in the portal. Depending on the amount of data in the cache, the downtime from patching can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. If the geo-replication link is unhealthy for over an hour,file a support request.TheGeo-Replication Dashboardworkbook is a simple and easy way to view all Premium-tier geo-replication metrics in the same place. This dashboard pulls together metrics that are only emitted by the geo-primary or geo-secondary, so they can be viewed simultaneously.Geo Replication Connectivity LagDepicts the time, in seconds, since the last successful data synchronization between geo-primary & geo-secondary.

When you see lots of writes on geo-primary, and replication between the two caches canât keep up, then a full sync is needed. A full sync involves copying the complete data from geo-primary to geo-secondary by taking an RDB snapshot rather than a partial sync that occurs on normal instances.

Server LoadThe percentage of CPU cycles in which the Redis server is busy processing andnot waiting idlefor messages. If this counter reaches 100, the Redis server has hit a performance ceiling, and the CPU can't process work any faster. You can expect a large latency effect. If you're seeing a high Redis Server Load, such as 100, because you're sending many expensive commands to the server, then you might see timeout exceptions in the client. In this case, you should consider scaling up, scaling out to a Premium cluster, or partitioning your data into multiple caches. WhenServer Loadis only moderately high, such as 50 to 80 percent, then average latency usually remains low, and timeout exceptions could have other causes than high server latency.TheServer Loadmetric is sensitive to other processes on the machine using the existing CPU cycles that reduce the Redis server's idle time. For example, on theC1tier, background tasks such as virus scanning causeServer Loadto spike higher for no obvious reason. We recommended that you pay attention to other metrics such as operations, latency, and CPU, in addition toServer Load.CautionTheServer Loadmetric can present incorrect data for Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tier caches. SometimesServer Loadis represented as being over 100. We are investigating this issue. We recommend using the CPU metric instead in the meantime.
Server Load
The percentage of CPU cycles in which the Redis server is busy processing andnot waiting idlefor messages. If this counter reaches 100, the Redis server has hit a performance ceiling, and the CPU can't process work any faster. You can expect a large latency effect. If you're seeing a high Redis Server Load, such as 100, because you're sending many expensive commands to the server, then you might see timeout exceptions in the client. In this case, you should consider scaling up, scaling out to a Premium cluster, or partitioning your data into multiple caches.

SetsThe number of set operations to the cache during the specified reporting interval. This value is the sum of the following values from the Redis INFO all command:cmdstat_set,cmdstat_hset,cmdstat_hmset,cmdstat_hsetnx,cmdstat_lset,cmdstat_mset,cmdstat_msetnx,cmdstat_setbit,cmdstat_setex,cmdstat_setrange, andcmdstat_setnx.

Total KeysThe maximum number of keys in the cache during the past reporting time period. This number maps tokeyspacefrom the Redis INFO command.ImportantBecause of a limitation in the underlying metrics system for caches with clustering enabled, Total Keys return the maximum number of keys of the shard that had the maximum number of keys during the reporting interval.

Total OperationsThe total number of commands processed by the cache server during the specified reporting interval. This value maps tototal_commands_processedfrom the Redis INFO command. When Azure Cache for Redis is used purely for pub/sub, there are no metrics forCache Hits,Cache Misses,Gets, orSets, but there areTotal Operationsmetrics that reflect the cache usage for pub/sub operations.

Used MemoryThe amount of cache memory in MB that is used for key/value pairs in the cache during the specified reporting interval. This value maps toused_memoryfrom the Redis INFO command. This value doesn't include metadata or fragmentation.On the Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tier, the Used Memory value includes the memory in both the primary and replica nodes. This can make the metric appear twice as large as expected.
