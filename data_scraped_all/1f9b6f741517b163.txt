InAzure AI Foundry portal, hubs provide the environment for a team to collaborate and organize work, and help you as a team lead or IT admin centrally set up security settings and govern usage and spend. You can create and manage a hub from the Azure portal or from the Azure AI Foundry portal, and then your developers can create projects from the hub.
In this article, you learn how to create and manage a hub in Azure AI Foundry portal with the default settings so you can get started quickly. Do you need to customize security or the dependent resources of your hub? Then useAzure portalortemplate options.
Tip
If you're an individual developer and not an admin, dev lead, or part of a larger effort that requires a hub, you can create a project directly from the Azure AI Foundry portal without creating a hub first. For more information, seeCreate a project.
If you're an admin or dev lead and would like to create your Azure AI Foundry hub using a template, see the articles on usingBiceporTerraform.
Create a hub in Azure AI Foundry portal
To create a new hub, you need either the Owner or Contributor role on the resource group or on an existing hub. If you're unable to create a hub due to permissions, reach out to your administrator. If your organization is usingAzure Policy, don't create the resource in Azure AI Foundry portal. Create the hubin the Azure portalinstead.
Note
A hub in Azure AI Foundry portal is a one-stop shop where you manage everything your AI project needs, like security and resources, so you can develop and test faster. To learn more about how hubs can help you, see theHubs and projects overviewarticle.
To create a hub inAzure AI Foundry, follow these steps:
Go toAzure AI Foundryand sign in with your Azure account.

In theCreate a new hubdialog, enter a name for your hub (such ascontoso-hub) and modify the other fields as desired. By default, a new AI services connection is created for the hub.NoteIf you don't see (new) before theResource groupandConnect Azure AI Servicesentries then an existing resource is being used. For the purposes of this tutorial, create a separate entity viaCreate new resource groupandCreate new AI Services. This will allow you to prevent any unexpected charges by deleting the entities after the tutorial.

Manage your hub from the Azure portal
Manage access control
You can add and remove users from the Azure AI Foundry portal management center. Both the hub and projects within the hub have aUsersentry in the left-menu that allows you to add and remove users. When adding users, you can assign them built-in roles.

For custom role assignments, useAccess control (IAM)within the Azure portal. Learn more about hubrole-based access control.
To add grant users permissions from the Azure portal:
Select+ Addto add users to your hub.
Select+ Addto add users to your hub.
Select theRoleyou want to assign.

Networking
Hub networking settings can be set during resource creation or changed in theNetworkingtab in the Azure portal view. Creating a new hub invokes a Managed Virtual Network. This streamlines and automates your network isolation configuration with a built-in Managed Virtual Network. The Managed Virtual Network settings are applied to all projects created within a hub.
At hub creation, select between the networking isolation modes:Public,Private with Internet Outbound, andPrivate with Approved Outbound. To secure your resource, select eitherPrivate with Internet OutboundorPrivate with Approved Outboundfor your networking needs. For the private isolation modes, a private endpoint should be created for inbound access. For more information on network isolation, seeManaged virtual network isolation. To create a secure hub, seeCreate a secure hub.
At hub creation in the Azure portal, creation of associated Azure AI services, Storage account, Key vault (optional), Application insights (optional), and Container registry (optional) is given. These resources are found on the Resources tab during creation.
To connect to Azure AI services (Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure AI Content Safety) or storage accounts in Azure AI Foundry portal, create a private endpoint in your virtual network. Ensure the public network access (PNA) flag is disabled when creating the private endpoint connection. For more about Azure AI services connections, seeVirtual networks for Azure AI Services. You can optionally bring your own Azure AI Search, but it requires a private endpoint connection from your virtual network.
Encryption
Projects that use the same hub, share their encryption configuration. Encryption mode can be set only at the time of hub creation between Microsoft-managed keys and Customer-managed keys (CMK).
From the Azure portal view, navigate to the encryption tab, to find the encryption settings for your hub.
For hubs that use CMK encryption mode, you can update the encryption key to a new key version. This update operation is constrained to keys and key versions within the same Key Vault instance as the original key.

Update Azure Application Insights and Azure Container Registry
To use custom environments for Prompt Flow, you're required to configure an Azure Container Registry for your hub. To use Azure Application Insights for Prompt Flow deployments, a configured Azure Application Insights resource is required for your hub. Updating the workspace-attached Azure Container Registry or Application Insights resources might break lineage of previous jobs, deployed inference endpoints, or your ability to rerun earlier jobs in the workspace. After association with an Azure AI Foundry hub, Azure Container Registry and Application Insights resources can't be disassociated (set to null).
You can use the Azure portal, Azure SDK/CLI options, or the infrastructure-as-code templates to update both Azure Application Insights and Azure Container Registry for the hub.
Azure portal
Python SDK
Azure CLI
You can configure your hub for these resources during creation or update after creation.
To update Azure Application Insights from the Azure portal, navigate to thePropertiesfor your hub in the Azure portal, then selectChange Application Insights.

from azure.ai.ml.entities import Hub

my_app_insights = "{APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_ARM_ID}"
my_container_registry = "{CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ARM_ID}"

# construct a basic hub
my_hub = Hub(name="myexamplehub", 
             location="East US", 
             application_insights=my_app_insights,
             container_registry=my_container_registry)

# update_dependent_resources is used to give consent to update the workspace dependent resources.
created_hub = ml_client.workspaces.begin_update(workspace=my_hub, update_dependent_resources=True).result()

Choose how credentials are stored
Select scenarios in Azure AI Foundry portal store credentials on your behalf. For example, when you create a connection in Azure AI Foundry portal to access an Azure Storage account with stored account key, access Azure Container Registry with admin password, or when you create a compute instance with enabled SSH keys. No credentials are stored with connections when you choose Microsoft Entra ID identity-based authentication.
You can choose where credentials are stored:
Your Azure Key Vault: This requires you to manage your own Azure Key Vault instance and configure it per hub. It gives you more control over secret lifecycle, for example, to set expiry policies. You can also share stored secrets with other applications in Azure.

Microsoft-managed credential store (preview): In this variant Microsoft manages an Azure Key Vault instance on your behalf per hub. No resource management is needed on your side and the vault doesn't show in your Azure subscription. Secret data lifecycle follows the resource lifecycle of your hubs and projects. For example, when a project's storage connection is deleted, its stored secret is deleted as well.

Delete an Azure AI Foundry hub
To delete a hub from Azure AI Foundry, select the hub and then selectDelete hubfrom theHub propertiessection of the page.

Note
You can also delete the hub from the Azure portal.
Deleting a hub deletes all associated projects. When a project is deleted, all nested endpoints for the project are also deleted. You can optionally delete connected resources; however, make sure that no other applications are using this connection. For example, another Azure AI Foundry deployment might be using it.
