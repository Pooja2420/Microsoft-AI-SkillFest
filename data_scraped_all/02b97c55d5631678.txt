Workflow
Remote clients send input via Azure ExpressRoute or from other Azure applications. In both cases, TCP/IP is the primary connection to the system.A web browser accesses Azure system resources, which replaces terminal emulation for demand users and online users. Users access web-based applications over Transport Layer Security (TLS) port 443. To minimize user retraining, web applications' presentation layers can remain virtually unchanged. Or you can update the web application presentation layer with modern user experience frameworks.(1a) For enhanced security, Microsoft Entra ID can enable and enforce authentication and authorization.

The type of application compute cluster that's used depends on whether the application runs on virtual machines (VMs) or in a container cluster like Kubernetes. Usually, mainframe system emulation for applications that are written in PL/I or COBOL use VMs. Applications that are refactored to Java or .NET use containers. Some mainframe system emulation software also supports deployment in containers.

You can add several network interface cards to one Azure VM so that child VMs can have their own dedicated network interface devices and IP addresses. That configuration is similar to this architecture.

Scenario details
CFs are physical devices that connect multiple mainframe servers or CECs to shared memory so that systems can scale out to increase performance. Applications that are written in languages like COBOL and PL/I seamlessly use these tightly coupled scale-out features.
IBM Db2 databases and CICS servers can use CFs with a mainframe subsystem called Parallel Sysplex that combines data sharing and parallel computing. Parallel Sysplex enables a cluster of up to 32 systems to share workloads, which provides high performance, high availability, and DR. Mainframe CFs with Parallel Sysplex typically reside in the same datacenter, with close proximity between the CECs, but can also extend across datacenters.
Azure resources can provide similar scale-out performance with shared data and high availability. Azure compute clusters share memory through data caching mechanisms, like Azure Cache for Redis, and use scalable data technologies, like SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB. To extend scale-out compute and high availability to distributed Azure datacenters, Azure can implement availability sets and availability groups and combine them with geo-redundant capabilities.
