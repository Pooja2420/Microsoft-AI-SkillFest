Target resources (formerly Cloud apps, actions, and authentication context) are key signals in a Conditional Access policy. Conditional Access policies allow administrators to assign controls to specific applications, services, actions, or authentication context.
Administrators can choose from the list of applications or services that include built-in Microsoft applications and anyMicrosoft Entra integrated applicationsincluding gallery, non-gallery, and applications published throughApplication Proxy.
Administrators might choose to define policy not based on a cloud application but on auser actionlikeRegister security informationorRegister or join devices, allowing Conditional Access to enforce controls around those actions.
Administrators can targettraffic forwarding profilesfrom Global Secure Access for enhanced functionality.
Administrators can useauthentication contextto provide an extra layer of security in applications.

Microsoft cloud applications
Many of the existing Microsoft cloud applications are included in the list of applications you can select from.
Administrators can assign a Conditional Access policy to these Microsoft cloud applications. Some apps likeOffice 365andWindows Azure Service Management APIinclude multiple related child apps or services.
Important
Applications that are available to Conditional Access go through an onboarding and validation process. These applications don't include all Microsoft apps. Many applications are backend services that aren't meant to have policy directly applied to them. If you're looking for an application that is missing, you can contact the specific application team or make a request onUserVoice.
Office 365
Microsoft 365 provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration services like Exchange, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams. Microsoft 365 cloud services are deeply integrated to ensure smooth and collaborative experiences. This integration can cause confusion when creating policies as some apps such as Microsoft Teams have dependencies on others such as SharePoint or Exchange.
The Office 365 suite makes it possible to target these services all at once. We recommend using the new Office 365 suite, instead of targeting individual cloud apps to avoid issues withservice dependencies.
Targeting this group of applications helps to avoid issues that might arise because of inconsistent policies and dependencies. For example: The Exchange Online app is tied to traditional Exchange Online data like mail, calendar, and contact information. Related metadata might be exposed through different resources like search. To ensure that all metadata is protected by as intended, administrators should assign policies to the Office 365 app.
Administrators can exclude the entire Office 365 suite or specific Office 365 cloud apps from the Conditional Access policy.
A complete list of all services included can be found in the articleApps included in Conditional Access Office 365 app suite.
Windows Azure Service Management API
When you target the Windows Azure Service Management API application, policy is enforced for tokens issued to a set of services closely bound to the portal. This grouping includes the application IDs of:
Azure Resource Manager
Azure portal, which also covers the Microsoft Entra admin center
Azure Data Lake
Application Insights API
Log Analytics API
Because the policy is applied to the Azure management portal and API, any services or clients that depend on the Azure API can be indirectly affected. For example:
Azure CLI
Azure Data Factory portal
Azure DevOps
Azure Event Hubs
Azure PowerShell
Azure Service Bus
Azure SQL Database
Azure Synapse
Classic deployment model APIs
Microsoft 365 admin center
Microsoft IoT Central
SQL Managed Instance
Visual Studio subscriptions administrator portal
Note
The Windows Azure Service Management API application applies toAzure PowerShell, which calls theAzure Resource Manager API. It doesn't apply toMicrosoft Graph PowerShell, which calls theMicrosoft Graph API.
For more information on how to set up a sample policy for Windows Azure Service Management API, seeConditional Access: Require MFA for Azure management.
Tip
For Azure Government, you should target the Azure Government Cloud Management API application.
Microsoft Admin Portals
When a Conditional Access policy targets the Microsoft Admin Portals cloud app, the policy is enforced for tokens issued to application IDs of the following Microsoft administrative portals:
Azure portal
Exchange admin center
Microsoft 365 admin center
Microsoft 365 Defender portal
Microsoft Entra admin center
Microsoft Intune admin center
Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Microsoft Teams admin center
We're continually adding more administrative portals to the list.
Note
The Microsoft Admin Portals app applies to interactive sign-ins to the listed admin portals only. Sign-ins to the underlying resources or services like Microsoft Graph or Azure Resource Manager APIs aren't covered by this application. Those resources are protected by theWindows Azure Service Management APIapp. This grouping enables customers to move along the MFA adoption journey for admins without impacting automation that relies on APIs and PowerShell. When you're ready, Microsoft recommends using apolicy requiring administrators perform MFA alwaysfor comprehensive protection.
Other applications
Administrators can add any Microsoft Entra registered application to Conditional Access policies. These applications might include:
Applications published throughMicrosoft Entra application proxy
Applications added from the gallery
Custom applications not in the gallery
Legacy applications published through app delivery controllers and networks
Applications that usepassword based single sign-on
Note
Since Conditional Access policy sets the requirements for accessing a service, you aren't able to apply it to a client (public/native) application. In other words, the policy isn't set directly on a client (public/native) application, but is applied when a client calls a service. For example, a policy set on SharePoint service applies to all clients calling SharePoint. A policy set on Exchange applies to the attempt to access the email using Outlook client. That is why client (public/native) applications aren't available for selection in the app picker and Conditional Access option isn't available in the application settings for the client (public/native) application registered in your tenant.
Some applications don't appear in the picker at all. The only way to include these applications in a Conditional Access policy is to includeâ¯All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps').
Conditional Access applies to resources not clients, except when the client is a confidential client requesting an ID token.
Public clientPublic clients are those that run locally on devices like Microsoft Outlook on the desktop or mobile apps like Microsoft Teams.Conditional Access policies don't apply to the public client itself, but apply based on the resources requested by the public clients.
Public clients are those that run locally on devices like Microsoft Outlook on the desktop or mobile apps like Microsoft Teams.
Conditional Access policies don't apply to the public client itself, but apply based on the resources requested by the public clients.
Confidential clientConditional Access applies to the resources requested by the client and the confidential client itself if it requests an ID token.For example: If Outlook Web requests a token for scopesMail.ReadandFiles.Read, Conditional Access applies policies for Exchange and SharePoint. Additionally, if Outlook Web requests an ID token, Conditional Access also applies the policies for Outlook Web.

To viewsign-in logsfor these client types from the Microsoft Entra admin center:
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aReports Reader.
Browse toEntra ID>Monitoring & health>Sign-in logs.
Add a filter forClient credential type.
Adjust the filter to view a specific set of logs based on the client credential used in the sign-in.
For more information see the articlePublic client and confidential client applications.

All resources
Applying a Conditional Access policy toAll resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')without any app exclusions results in the policy being enforced for all token requests from web sites and services includingGlobal Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles. This option includes applications that aren't individually targetable in Conditional Access policy, such asWindows Azure Active Directory(00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000).
Windows Azure Active Directory
Important
Microsoft recommends creating a baseline multifactor authentication policy targeting all users and all resources (without any app exclusions), like the one explained inRequire multifactor authentication for all users.
If any app is excluded from the policy, in order to not inadvertently block user access, certain low privilege scopes are excluded from policy enforcement. These scopes allow calls to the underlying Graph APIs, likeWindows Azure Active Directory(00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000) andMicrosoft Graph(00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000), to access user profile and group membership information commonly used by applications as part of authentication. For example: when Outlook requests a token for Exchange, it also asks for theUser.Readscope to be able to display the basic account information of the current user.
Windows Azure Active Directory
Microsoft Graph
User.Read
Most apps have a similar dependency, which is why these low privilege scopes are automatically excluded whenever there's an app exclusion in anAll resourcespolicy. These low privilege scope exclusions don't allow data access beyond basic user profile and group information. The excluded scopes are listed as follows, consent is still required for apps to use these permissions.
Native clients and Single page applications (SPAs) have access to the following low privilege scopes:Azure AD Graph:email,offline_access,openid,profile,User.ReadMicrosoft Graph:email,offline_access,openid,profile,User.Read,People.Read

If therecommended baseline MFA policy without app exclusionscan't be configured due to business reasons, and your organizationâs security policy must include directory-related low privilege scopes (User.Read,User.Read.All,User.ReadBasic.All,People.Read,People.Read.All,GroupMember.Read.All,Member.Read.Hidden), the alternative is to create a separate Conditional Access policy targetingWindows Azure Active Directory(00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000). Windows Azure Active Directory (also called Azure AD Graph) is a resource representing data stored in the directory such as users, groups, and applications. The Windows Azure Active Directory resource is included inAll resourcesbut can be individually targeted in Conditional Access policies by using the following steps:
User.Read
User.Read.All
User.ReadBasic.All
People.Read
People.Read.All
GroupMember.Read.All

TheAll internet resources with Global Secure Accessoption allows administrators to target theinternet access traffic forwarding profilefromMicrosoft Entra Internet Access.
These profiles in Global Secure Access enable administrators to define and control how traffic is routed through Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access. Traffic forwarding profiles can be assigned to devices and remote networks. For an example of how to apply a Conditional Access policy to these traffic profiles, see the articleHow to apply Conditional Access policies to the Microsoft 365 traffic profile.
For more information about these profiles, see the articleGlobal Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles.
User actions
User actions are tasks that a user performs. Currently, Conditional Access supports two user actions:
Register security information: This user action allows Conditional Access policy to enforce when users who are enabled for combined registration attempt to register their security information. More information can be found in the article,Combined security information registration.
Note
When administrators apply a policy targeting user actions for register security information, if the user account is a guest fromMicrosoft personal account (MSA), using the control 'Require multifactor authentication', will require the MSA user to register security information with the organization. If the guest user is from another provider such asGoogle, access is blocked.
Register or join devices: This user action enables administrators to enforce Conditional Access policy when usersregisterorjoindevices to Microsoft Entra ID. It provides granularity in configuring multifactor authentication for registering or joining devices instead of a tenant-wide policy that currently exists. There are three key considerations with this user action:Require multifactor authenticationis the only access control available with this user action and all others are disabled. This restriction prevents conflicts with access controls that are either dependent on Microsoft Entra device registration or not applicable to Microsoft Entra device registration.Client apps,Filters for devices, andDevice stateconditions aren't available with this user action since they're dependent on Microsoft Entra device registration to enforce Conditional Access policies.

Warning
When a Conditional Access policy is configured with theRegister or join devicesuser action, you must setEntra ID>Devices>Overview>Device Settings-Require Multifactor Authentication to register or join devices with Microsoft EntratoNo. Otherwise, Conditional Access policies with this user action aren't properly enforced. More information about this device setting can found inConfigure device settings.

Authentication context
Authentication context can be used to further secure data and actions in applications. These applications can be your own custom applications, custom line of business (LOB) applications, applications like SharePoint, or applications protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
For example, an organization might keep files in SharePoint sites like the lunch menu or their secret BBQ sauce recipe. Everyone might have access to the lunch menu site, but users who have access to the secret BBQ sauce recipe site might need to access from a managed device and agree to specific terms of use.
Authentication context works with users orworkload identities, but not in the same Conditional Access policy.
Configure authentication contexts
Authentication contexts are managed underEntra ID>Conditional Access>Authentication context.

Create new authentication context definitions by selectingNew authentication context. Organizations are limited to a total of 99 authentication context definitionsc1-c99. Configure the following attributes:
Display nameis the name that is used to identify the authentication context in Microsoft Entra ID and across applications that consume authentication contexts. We recommend names that can be used across resources, liketrusted devices, to reduce the number of authentication contexts needed. Having a reduced set limits the number of redirects and provides a better end to end-user experience.
Descriptionprovides more information about the policies, used by administrators and those applying authentication contexts to resources.
Publish to appscheckbox when checked, advertises the authentication context to apps and makes them available to be assigned. If not checked the authentication context is unavailable to downstream resources.
IDis read-only and used in tokens and apps for request-specific authentication context definitions. Listed here for troubleshooting and development use cases.
Administrators can select published authentication contexts in their Conditional Access policies underAssignments>Cloud apps or actionsand selectingAuthentication contextfrom theSelect what this policy applies tomenu.

When you delete an authentication context, make sure no applications are still using it. Otherwise access to app data is no longer protected. You can confirm this prerequisite by checking sign-in logs for cases when the authentication context Conditional Access policies are being applied.
To delete an authentication context, it must have no assigned Conditional Access policies and must not be published to apps. This requirement helps prevent the accidental deletion of an authentication context that is still in use.
