Troubleshooting guidance
Check whether a virtual network gateway is running in the virtual network.
Check whether an application gateway is running in the virtual network.
Check whether Azure container instances still exist in the virtual network.
Check whether Microsoft Entra Domain Service is enabled in the virtual network.
Check whether the virtual network is connected to other resource.
Check whether a virtual machine is still running in the virtual network.
Check whether the virtual network is stuck in migration.
Check whether the virtual network was used by a web app for virtual network integration.
Troubleshooting steps
Check whether a virtual network gateway is running in the virtual network
To remove the virtual network, you must first remove the virtual network gateway.
For classic virtual networks, go to theOverviewpage of the classic virtual network in the Azure portal. In theVPN connectionssection, if the gateway is running in the virtual network, the IP address of the gateway is shown.

For virtual networks, go to theOverviewpage of the virtual network. CheckConnected devicesfor the virtual network gateway.

Before you can remove the gateway, first remove anyConnectionobjects in the gateway.
Check whether an application gateway is running in the virtual network
Go to theOverviewpage of the virtual network. Check theConnected devicesfor the application gateway.

If there's an application gateway, you must remove it before you can delete the virtual network.
Check whether Azure container instances still exist in the virtual network
In the Azure portal, go to the resource group'sOverviewpage.
In the Azure portal, go to the resource group'sOverviewpage.
In the header for the list of the resource group's resources, selectShow hidden types. The network profile type is hidden in the Azure portal by default.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, use theseAzure CLI commandsto clean up resources.

Check whether Microsoft Entra Domain Service is enabled in the virtual network
If the Active Directory Domain Service is enabled and connected to the virtual network, you can't delete this virtual network.
To disable the service, seeDisable Microsoft Entra Domain Services using the Azure portal.
Check whether the virtual network is connected to other resource
Check for Circuit Links, connections, and virtual network peerings. Any of these can cause a virtual network deletion to fail.
The recommended deletion order is as follows:
Gateway connections
Gateways
IPs
Virtual network peerings
App Service Environment (ASE)
Check whether a virtual machine is still running in the virtual network
Make sure that no virtual machine is in the virtual network.
Check whether the virtual network is stuck in migration
If the virtual network is stuck in a migration state, it can't be deleted. Run the following command to abort the migration, and then delete the virtual network.
Move-AzureVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetworkName "Name" -Abort
Move-AzureVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetworkName "Name" -Abort
Check whether the virtual network was used by a web app for virtual network integration
If the virtual network was integrated with a web app in the past, then the web app was deleted without disconnecting the virtual network integration, seeDeleting the App Service plan or web app before disconnecting the virtual network integration.
