Authentication for a scan
Your Azure network may allow for communications between your Azure resources, but if you've set up firewalls, private endpoints, or virtual networks within Azure, you'll need to follow one of these configurations below.
*To use a self-hosted integration runtime, you'll first need tochoose the right one for your scenario, create one, and confirm yournetwork settings for Microsoft Purview.
There are two types of managed identity you can use:
System-assigned managed identity (Recommended)- As soon as the Microsoft Purview Account is created, a system-assigned managed identity (SAMI) is created automatically in Microsoft Entra tenant. Depending on the type of resource, specific RBAC role assignments are required for the Microsoft Purview system-assigned managed identity (SAMI) to perform the scans.

Depending on the type of resource, specific RBAC role assignments are required for the Microsoft Purview system-assigned managed identity (SAMI) to perform the scans.
User-assigned managed identity(preview) - Similar to a system managed identity, a user-assigned managed identity (UAMI) is a credential resource that can be used to allow Microsoft Purview to authenticate against Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, you can see ourUser-assigned managed identity guide.
It's important to give your Microsoft Purview account the permission to scan the Azure Blob data source. You can add access for the SAMI or UAMI at the Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource level, depending on what level scan permission is needed.

Data sharing
Microsoft Purview Data Sharing (preview) enables sharing of data in-place from Azure Blob storage account to Azure Blob storage account. This section provides details about the  specific requirements for sharing and receiving data in-place between Azure Blob storage accounts. Refer toHow to share dataandHow to receive sharefor step by step guides on how to use data sharing.
Storage accounts supported for in-place data sharing
The following storage accounts are supported for in-place data sharing:
Regions: Canada Central, Canada East, UK South, UK West, Australia East, Japan East, Korea South, and South Africa North
Redundancy options: LRS, GRS, RA-GRS
Tiers: Hot, Cool
Only use storage accounts without production workload for the preview.
Note
Source and target storage accounts must be in the same region as each other. They don't need to be in the same region as the Microsoft Purview account.
Storage account permissions required to share data
To add or update a storage account asset to a share, you need ONE of the following permissions:
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write- This permission is available in theOwnerrole.
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/modifyPermissions/- This permission is available in theBlob Storage Data Ownerrole.
Storage account permissions required to receive shared data
To map a storage account asset in a received share, you need ONE of the following permissions:
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write- This permission is  available in theContributorandOwnerrole.
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write- This permission is available in theContributor,Owner,Storage Blob Data ContributorandStorage Blob Data Ownerrole.
Update shared data in source storage account
Updates you make to shared files or data in the shared folder from source storage account will be made available to recipient in target storage account in near real time. When you delete subfolder or files within the shared folder, they will disappear for recipient. To delete the shared folder, file or parent folders or containers, you need to first revoke access to all your shares from the source storage account.
Access shared data in target storage account
The target storage account enables recipient to access the shared data read-only in near real time. You can connect analytics tools such as Synapse Workspace and Databricks to the shared data to perform analytics. Cost of accessing the shared data is charged to the target storage account.
Service limit
Source storage account can support up to 20 targets, and target storage account can support up to 100 sources. If you require an increase in limit, please contact Support.
Policies
The following types of policies are supported on this data resource from Microsoft Purview:
Data owner policies- a set of policy statements that allow you to grant users and groups access to data sources.
Self-service access policies- policy that allows users to request access to data sources registered to Microsoft Purview.
Protection policies- denies access to data tagged with sensitivity labels to all users except those specified by the policy.
Access policy pre-requisites on Azure Storage accounts
AllMicrosoft Purview regionsare supported.
Storage accounts in the following regions are supported without the need for additional configuration. However, zone-redundant storage (ZRS) accounts are not supported.Australia CentralAustralia EastAustralia SoutheastBrazil SouthCanada CentralCanada EastCentral IndiaCentral USEast AsiaEast US 2East USFrance CentralGermany West CentralJapan EastJapan WestKorea CentralNorth Central USNorth EuropeNorway EastPoland CentralQatar CentralSouth Central USSouth Africa NorthSoutheast AsiaSouth IndiaSweden CentralSwitzerland NorthWest Central USWest EuropeWest USWest US 2West US 3UAE NorthUK SouthUK West

Storage accounts in other regions in Public Cloud are supported after setting feature flagAllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement, as outlined in the next section. Newly created ZRS Storage accounts are supported, if created after setting the feature flagAllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement.
If needed, you can create a new Storage account byfollowing this guide.
This step is only necessary in certain regions (see prior section). To enable Microsoft Purview to manage policies for one or more Azure Storage accounts, execute the following PowerShell commands in the subscription where you'll deploy your Azure Storage account. These PowerShell commands will enable Microsoft Purview to manage policies on all Azure Storage accounts in that subscription.
If youâre executing these commands locally, be sure to run PowerShell as an administrator.
Alternatively, you can use theAzure Cloud Shellin the Azure portal:https://shell.azure.com.
# Install the Az module
Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
# Login into the subscription
Connect-AzAccount -Subscription <SubscriptionID>
# Register the feature
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage
# Install the Az module
Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
# Login into the subscription
Connect-AzAccount -Subscription <SubscriptionID>
# Register the feature
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage
If the output of the last command showsRegistrationStateasRegistered, then your subscription is enabled for access policies.
If the output isRegistering, wait at least 10 minutes, and then retry the command.Do not continue unless the RegistrationState shows asRegistered.
Configure the Microsoft Purview account for policies
Before a policy can be created in Microsoft Purview for a data resource, you must register that data resource in Microsoft Purview Studio. You will find the instructions related to registering the data resource later in this guide.
Note
Microsoft Purview policies rely on the data resource ARM path. If a data resource is moved to a new resource group or subscription it will need to be de-registered and then registered again in Microsoft Purview.
Once a resource is registered, but before a policy can be created in Microsoft Purview for that resource, you must configure permissions. A set of permissions are needed to enable theData policy enforcement. This applies to data sources, resource groups, or subscriptions. To enableData policy enforcement, you must havebothspecific Identity and Access Management (IAM) privileges on the resource as well as specific Microsoft Purview privileges:
You must haveeither oneof the following IAM role combinations on the resource's Azure Resource Manager path or any parent of it (that is, using IAM permission inheritance):IAM OwnerBoth IAM Contributor and IAM User Access AdministratorTo configure Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, followthis guide. The following screenshot shows how to access theAccess Controlsection in the Azure portal for the data resource to add a role assignment.NoteTheIAM Ownerrole for a data resource can be inherited from a parent resource group, a subscription, or a subscription management group. Check which Microsoft Entra users, groups, and service principals hold or are inheriting theIAM Ownerrole for the resource.
You must haveeither oneof the following IAM role combinations on the resource's Azure Resource Manager path or any parent of it (that is, using IAM permission inheritance):
IAM Owner
Both IAM Contributor and IAM User Access Administrator
To configure Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, followthis guide. The following screenshot shows how to access theAccess Controlsection in the Azure portal for the data resource to add a role assignment.

Note
TheIAM Ownerrole for a data resource can be inherited from a parent resource group, a subscription, or a subscription management group. Check which Microsoft Entra users, groups, and service principals hold or are inheriting theIAM Ownerrole for the resource.
You also need to have the Microsoft PurviewData source adminrole for the collection or a parent collection (if inheritance is enabled). For more information, see theguide on managing Microsoft Purview role assignments.The following screenshot shows how to assign theData source adminrole at the root collection level.
You also need to have the Microsoft PurviewData source adminrole for the collection or a parent collection (if inheritance is enabled). For more information, see theguide on managing Microsoft Purview role assignments.
The following screenshot shows how to assign theData source adminrole at the root collection level.

To create, update or delete policies, you need to get thePolicy authorrole in Microsoft Purview atroot collection level:
ThePolicy authorrole can create, update, and delete DevOps and Data Owner policies.
ThePolicy authorrole can delete self-service access policies.
For more information about managing Microsoft Purview role assignments, seeCreate and manage collections in the Microsoft Purview Data Map.
Note
Policy author role must be configured at the root collection level.
In addition, to easily search Microsoft Entra users or groups when creating or updating the subject of a policy, you can greatly benefit from getting theDirectory Readerspermission in Microsoft Entra ID. This is a common permission for users in an Azure tenant. Without the Directory Reader permission, the Policy Author will have to type the complete username or email for all the principals included in the subject of a data policy.
Data Owner policies allow for checks and balances if you assign the Microsoft PurviewPolicy authorandData source adminroles to different people in the organization. Before a Data owner policy takes effect, a second person (Data source admin) must review it and explicitly approve it by publishing it. This does not apply to DevOps or Self-service access policies as publishing is automatic for them when those policies are created or updated.
To publish a Data owner policy you need to get theData source adminrole in Microsoft Purview atroot collection level.
For more information about managing Microsoft Purview role assignments, seeCreate and manage collections in the Microsoft Purview Data Map.
Note
To publish Data owner policies, the Data source admin role  must be configured at the root collection level.
After a resource has been enabled forData policy enforcement, any Microsoft Purview user with thePolicy authorrole at the root collection level can provision access to that data source from Microsoft Purview.
Note
Any Microsoft Purview rootCollection admincan assign new users to rootPolicy authorroles. AnyCollection admincan assign new users to aData source adminrole under the collection. Minimize and carefully vet the users who hold Microsoft PurviewCollection admin,Data source admin, orPolicy authorroles.
If a Microsoft Purview account with published policies is deleted, such policies will stop being enforced within an amount of time that depends on the specific data source. This change can have implications on both security and data access availability. The Contributor and Owner roles in IAM can delete Microsoft Purview accounts. You can check these permissions by going to theAccess control (IAM)section for your Microsoft Purview account and selectingRole Assignments. You can also use a lock to prevent the Microsoft Purview account from being deleted throughResource Manager locks.
Register the data source in Microsoft Purview for Data Policy Enforcement
The Azure Storage resource needs to be registered first with Microsoft Purview before you can create access policies.
To register your resource, follow thePrerequisitesandRegistersections of this guide:
Register Azure Blob Storage in Microsoft Purview
After you've registered the data source, you'll need to enable Data Policy Enforcement. This is a pre-requisite before you can create policies on the data source. Data Policy Enforcement can impact the security of your data, as it delegates to certain Microsoft Purview roles managing access to the data sources.Go through the secure practices related to Data Policy Enforcement in this guide:How to enable Data Policy Enforcement
Once your data source has theData Policy Enforcementoption set toEnabled, it will look like this screenshot:
Create a policy
To create an access policy for Azure Blob Storage, follow this guide:Provision read/modify access on a single storage account.
To create policies that cover all data sources inside a resource group or Azure subscription you can refer tothis section.
Protection policy
Protection access control policies (protection policies) enable organizations to automatically protect sensitive data across data sources. Microsoft Purview already scans data assets and identifies sensitive data elements, and this new feature allows you to automatically restrict access to that data using sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection.
Follow this documentation to create a protection policy:How to create a Microsoft Purview Information Protection policy.
