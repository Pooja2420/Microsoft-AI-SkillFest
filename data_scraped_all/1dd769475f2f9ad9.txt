You can enable Azure Arc-enabled servers for multiple Windows or Linux machines in your environment with several flexible options depending on your requirements. Using the template script we provide, you can automate every step of the installation, including establishing the connection to Azure Arc. However, you are required to execute this script manually with an account that has elevated permissions on the target machine and in Azure.
One method to connect the machines to Azure Arc-enabled servers is to use a Microsoft Entraservice principal. This service principal method can be used instead of your privileged identity tointeractively connect the machine. This service principal is a special limited management identity that has only the minimum permission necessary to connect machines to Azure using theazcmagentcommand. This method is safer than using a higher privileged account like a Tenant Administrator and follows our access control security best practices.The service principal is used only during onboarding; it is not used for any other purpose.

Before you start connecting your machines, review the following requirements:
Make sure you have administrator permission on the machines you want to onboard.Administrator permissions are required to install the Connected Machine agent on the machines; on Linux by using the root account, and on Windows as a member of the Local Administrators group.

Automatic connection for SQL Server
When you connect a Windows or Linux server to Azure Arc that also has Microsoft SQL Server installed, the SQL Server instances will automatically be connected to Azure Arc as well.SQL Server enabled by Azure Arcprovides a detailed inventory and additional management capabilities for your SQL Server instances and databases. As part of the connection process, an extension is deployed to your Azure Arc-enabled server andnew roleswill be applied to your SQL Server and databases. If you don't want to automatically connect your SQL Servers to Azure Arc, you can opt out by adding a tag to the Windows or Linux server with the nameArcSQLServerExtensionDeploymentand valueDisabledwhen it's connected to Azure Arc.

Create a service principal for onboarding at scale
You can create a service principal in the Azure portal or by using Azure PowerShell.
Note
To create a service principal, your Microsoft Entra tenant needs to allow users to register applications. If it does not, your account must be a member of theApplication AdministratororCloud Application Administratoradministrative role. SeeDelegate app registration permissions in Microsoft Entra IDfor more information about tenant-level requirements. To assign Arc-enabled server roles, your account must be a member of theOwnerorUser Access Administratorrole in the subscription that you want to use for onboarding.
Azure portal
The Azure Arc service in the Azure portal provides a streamlined way to create a service principal that can be used to connect your hybrid machines to Azure.
At the top of the Azure portal, search for and selectAzure Arc.
In the service menu, under Management, selectService principals.
SelectAdd.
Enter a name for your service principal.
Choose whether the service principal will have access to an entire subscription, or only to a specific resource group.
Select the subscription (and resource group, if applicable) to which the service principal will have access.
Enter aService Tree IDfor the service principal.
In theClient secretsection, select the duration for which your generated client secret will be in use. You can optionally enter a friendly name of your choice in theDescriptionfield.
In theRole assignmentsection, selectAzure Connected Machine Onboarding.
SelectCreate.

Azure PowerShell
You can useAzure PowerShellto create a service principal with theNew-AzADServicePrincipalcmdlet.
Check the context of your Azure PowerShell session to ensure you're working in the correct subscription. UseSet-AzContextif you need to change the subscription.Get-AzContext

Run the following command to create a service principal and assign it the Azure Connected Machine Onboarding role for the selected subscription. After the service principal is created, it will print the application ID and secret. The secret is valid for 1 year, after which you'll need to generate a new secret and update any scripts with the new secret.$sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName "Arc server onboarding account" -Role "Azure Connected Machine Onboarding"
$sp | Format-Table AppId, @{ Name = "Secret"; Expression = { $_.PasswordCredentials.SecretText }}AppId                                Secret
-----                                ------

Install the agent and connect to Azure
Taking the script template created earlier, you can install and configure the Connected Machine agent on multiple hybrid Linux and Windows machines using your organizations preferred automation tool. The script performs similar steps described in theConnect hybrid machines to Azure from the Azure portalarticle. The difference is in the final step, where you establish the connection to Azure Arc using theazcmagentcommand using the service principal.
azcmagent
The following are the settings that you configure theazcmagentcommand to use for the service principal.
azcmagent
service-principal-id: The unique identifier (GUID) that represents the application ID of the service principal.
service-principal-id
service-principal-secret| The service principal password.
service-principal-secret
tenant-id: The unique identifier (GUID) that represents your dedicated instance of Microsoft Entra ID.
tenant-id
subscription-id: The subscription ID (GUID) of your Azure subscription that you want the machines in.
subscription-id
resource-group: The resource group name where you want your connected machines to belong to.
resource-group
location: Seesupported Azure regions. This location can be the same or different, as the resource group's location.
location
resource-name: (Optional) Used for the Azure resource representation of your on-premises machine. If you do not specify this value, the machine hostname is used.

You can learn more about theazcmagentcommand-line tool by reviewing theAzcmagent Reference.

Note
The Windows PowerShell script only supports running from a 64-bit version of Windows PowerShell.
After you install the agent and configure it to connect to Azure Arc-enabled servers, go to the Azure portal to verify that the server has successfully connected. View your machines in theAzure portal.
