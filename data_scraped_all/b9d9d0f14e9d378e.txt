This article provides the steps to procure and deliver Extended Security Updates (ESUs) to Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) VMs onboarded to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM.
Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager allows you to enroll all the Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 VMs managed by your SCVMM server inExtended Security Updatesat scale.
Key benefits
Delivering ESUs for SCVMM VMs through Arc offers the following benefits:
Pay-as-you-go:Flexibility to sign up for a monthly subscription service with the ability to migrate mid-year.

Note
Through Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM, you can procure and deliver ESUs only for SCVMM managed VMs and not for your hosts.
To purchase ESUs, you must have Software Assurance through Volume Licensing Programs such as an Enterprise Agreement (EA), Enterprise Agreement Subscription (EAS), Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES), or Server and Cloud Enrollment (SCE). Alternatively, if your Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 machines are licensed through Services Provider License Agreement (SPLA) or with a Server Subscription, Software Assurance isn't required to purchase ESUs.
Prerequisites
Before you procure and deliver ESUs for SCVMM VMs through Arc, ensure you meet these prerequisites:
The user account must have an Owner/Contributor role in a Resource Group in Azure to create and assign ESUs to SCVMM VMs.
The SCVMM server managing the Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 VMs, for which the ESUs are to be applied, should beonboarded to Azure Arc. After onboarding, the Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 VMs, for which the ESUs are to be applied, should beAzure-enabledandguest management enabled.
Create Azure Arc ESUs
To create Azure Arc ESUs, follow these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On theAzure Arcpage, selectExtended Security Updatesin the left pane. From here, you can view and create ESULicensesand viewEligible resourcesfor ESUs.

Link ESU licenses to Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs
You can select one or more Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs to link to an ESU license. Once you've linked a VM to an activated ESU license, the VM is eligible to receive Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 ESUs.
Note
You have the flexibility to configure your patching solution of choice to receive these updates â whether it'sAzure Update Manager,Windows Server Update Services, Microsoft Updates,Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, or a non-Microsoft patch management solution.
To link ESU licenses, follow these steps:
Select theEligible resourcestab to view a list of all your Azure Arc-enabled server machines running Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, including SCVMM machines that have the Azure Connected Machine agent installed. TheESUs statuscolumn indicates whether the machine is ESUs enabled.

To enable ESUs for one or more machines, select them in the list, and then selectEnable ESUs.
To enable ESUs for one or more machines, select them in the list, and then selectEnable ESUs.

Access to Azure services
For Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs enrolled in WS2012/2012 R2 ESUs enabled by Azure Arc, free access is provided to these Azure services fromOctober 10, 2023.
Azure Update Manager: Unified management and governance of update compliance that includes not only Azure and hybrid machines, but also ESU update compliance for all your Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 SCVMM VMs. Enrollment in ESUs doesn't have an impact on Azure Update Manager. After enrollment in ESUs through Azure Arc, the server becomes eligible for ESU patches. These patches can be delivered through Azure Update Manager or any other patching solution. You'll still need to configure updates from Microsoft Updates orWindows Server Update Services.

Upgrade from Windows Server 2012/2012 R2
You can select one or more Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs to link to an ESU license. Once you've linked a VM to an activated ESU license, the VM is eligible to receive Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 ESUs. When upgrading a Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 machine to Windows Server 2016 or above, it's not necessary to remove the Azure Connected Machine agent from the machine.
The new operating system will be visible for the machine in Azure within a few minutes of upgrade completion. Upgraded machines no longer require ESUs and are no longer eligible for them. Any ESU license associated with the machine isn't automatically unlinked from the machine. SeeUnlink a licensefor instructions on doing so manually.
Note
SeeTroubleshoot delivery of Extended Security Updates for Windows Server 2012to troubleshoot any problems that occur during the enablement process.
Review theadditional scenariosin which you may be eligible to receive ESU patches at no additional cost.
See thebilling principlesfor ESUs enabled by Azure Arc.
Next step
Programmatically deploy and manage Azure Arc Extended Security Updates licenses.
