Data collection endpoints in Azure Monitor

A data collection endpoint (DCE) is an Azure resource that defines a unique set of endpoints related to data collection, configuration, and ingestion in Azure Monitor. This article provides an overview of data collection endpoints and explains how to create and set them up based on your deployment.
Note
This article only relates to data collection scenarios in Azure Monitor that use adata collection rule (DCR). Legacy data collection scenarios such as collecting resource logs with diagnostic settings or Application insights data collection don't yet use DCEs in any way.
When is a DCE required?
A DCE isn't always required for data collection since the data source may use a public endpoint or the ingestion endpoints in the DCR. The sections below describes those scenarios where a DCE is required.
Azure Monitor agent (AMA)
AMAwill use a public endpoint by default to retrieve its configuration from Azure Monitor. A DCE is only required if you're usingprivate link.
Important
Since Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) is dependent on DNS private link zones, any AMA installation connected to a network that shares DNS with AMPLS resources will require a DCE. Get more details atEnable network isolation for Azure Monitor Agent by using Private Link.
You can view the agents associated with a DCE from itsResourcespage. ClickAddto add additional agents. To remove them, select one or more agents and clickDisassociate.

A DCE is required for certainAMA data sources. In this case, the DCE is specified in the DCR using that data source. If an agent is associated with multiple DCRs, a DCE is only required in those DCRs with data sources that require it. Other data sources can continue to use the public endpoint.
Important
If the data source is sending to a destination configured for private link, the DCE configured in the DCR for that data source must be added to AMPLS.
The following data sources currently require a DCE:
IIS Logs
Windows Firewall Logs
Text Logs
JSON Logs
Prometheus Metrics (Container Insights)
You can view the DCE for a DCR from theOverviewpage of the DCR. ClickConfigure DCEto modify it.

Logs ingestion API
When youcreate a DCR for Logs ingestion API, the DCR will have alogsIngestionproperty which is an endpoint that you can use to send logs using the API. If you use this endpoint, then you don't need a DCE. You can still use a DCE instead of the DCR endpoint if you prefer. You must use a DCE if you're sending data to a Log Analytics workspace configured for private link.
logsIngestion
Components of a DCE
A data collection endpoint includes components required to ingest data into Azure Monitor and send configuration files to Azure Monitor Agent.
How you set up endpoints for your deploymentdepends on whether your monitored resources and Log Analytics workspaces are in one or more regions.
This table describes the components of a data collection endpoint, related regionality considerations, and how to  set up the data collection endpoint when you create a data collection rule using the portal:
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>-1.ingest
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>-1.metrics.ingest
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>-1.handler.control
How to set up data collection endpoints based on your deployment
Scenario: All monitored resources are in the same region as the destination Log Analytics workspaceSet up one data collection endpoint to send configuration files and receive collected data.

Sample data collection endpoint
The sample data collection endpoint (DCE) below is for virtual machines with Azure Monitor agent, with public network access disabled so that agent only uses private links to communicate and send data to Azure Monitor/Log Analytics.

Limitations
Data collection endpoints only support Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Monitor Workspace as destinations for collected data.Custom metrics (preview)collected and uploaded via Azure Monitor Agent aren't currently controlled by DCEs.
Next steps
Add an endpoint to an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope resource
