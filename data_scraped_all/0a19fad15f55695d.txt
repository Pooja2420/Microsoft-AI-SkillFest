You can now add the "Test Case State" column to the Execute tab to quickly see the status of each test case. Whether itâs Approved, In Progress, or any other state, this update gives you clearer visibility into test readinessâwithout switching browser tabs or running complex queries.
The column is optional and can be enabled via the column picker. It also aligns with the existing âStateâ filter, allowing you to filter and view test case states side by side, all in one place. This enhancement helps ensure testers begin execution with test cases that are truly Ready or Approved, reducing the risk of running incomplete or draft itemsâand making your test runs more efficient from the start.
