When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation.
This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure AI Video Indexer. Azure AI Video Indexer usesAzure Monitor. If you're unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, readMonitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor.
Some services in Azure have a special focused prebuilt monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights."
Note
The monitoring feature isn't available for trial accounts. To update to an Azure Resource Manager account, see theUpdate your Azure AI Video Indexer account.
Monitoring data
Azure AI Video Indexer collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described inMonitoring data from Azure resources.
SeeMonitoringAzure AI Video Indexerdata referencefor detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure AI Video Indexer.
Collection and routing
Activity logs are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.
Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.
SeeCreate diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azurefor the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories forAzure AI Video Indexerare listed inAzure AI Video Indexer monitoring data reference.


The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.
Analyzing metrics
Currently Azure AI Video Indexer doesn't support monitoring of metrics.
Analyzing logs
Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.
All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined inAzure Monitor resource log schemaThe schema for Azure AI Video Indexer resource logs is found in theAzure AI Video Indexer Data Reference
TheActivity logis a type of platform sign-in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.
For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure AI Video Indexer, seeMonitoring Azure AI Video Indexer data reference
Sample Kusto queries
Important
When you selectLogsfrom the Azure AI Video Indexer account menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Azure AI Video Indexer account. It means that log queries only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure AI Video Indexer account or data from other Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu. SeeLog query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analyticsfor details.
Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your Azure AI Video Indexer account.

Alerts
Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts onmetrics,logs, and theactivity log. Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.
The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure AI Video Indexer.
//All failed uploads, aggregated in one hour window.
VIAudit
| where OperationName == "Upload-Video" and Status == "Failure"
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
//All failed uploads, aggregated in one hour window.
VIAudit
| where OperationName == "Upload-Video" and Status == "Failure"
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
