Confidential child capable VMs allow you to borrow resources from the parent VM you deploy, to create AMD SEV-SNP protected child VMs. The parent VM has almost complete feature parity with any other general purpose Azure VM (for example, D-series VMs). This parent-child deployment model can help you achieve higher levels of isolation from the Azure host and parent VM. These confidential child capable VMs are built on the same hardware that powers our Azure confidential VMs. Azure confidential VMs are now generally available. The DCas_cc_v5-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. These new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that do not require local temp disk.

Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
