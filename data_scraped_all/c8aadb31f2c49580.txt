In this quickstart, you create an Azure Event Hubs namespace and an event hub in the namespace by using theAzure portal.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have one,create a free accountbefore you begin.
If you are new to Azure Event Hubs, read throughEvent Hubs overviewandEvent Hubs features.
Create a resource group
A resource group is a logical collection of Azure resources. All resources are deployed and managed in a resource group. To create a resource group:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the left navigation, selectResource groups, and then selectCreate.

ForSubscription, select the name of the Azure subscription in which you want to create the resource group.

Type a uniquename for the resource group. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available in the currently selected Azure subscription.

Create an Event Hubs namespace
An Event Hubs namespace provides a unique scoping container, in which you create one or more event hubs. To create a namespace in your resource group using the portal, do the following actions:
In the Azure portal, selectAll servicesin the left menu, and selectEvent Hubsin theAnalyticscategory.

On theCreate namespacepage, take the following steps:Select thesubscriptionin which you want to create the namespace.Select theresource groupyou created in the previous step.Enter anamefor the namespace. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available.Select alocationfor the namespace.ChooseBasicfor thepricing tier. If you plan to use the namespace fromApache Kafkaapps, use theStandardtier. The basic tier doesn't support Apache Kafka workloads. To learn about differences between tiers, seeQuotas and limits,Event Hubs Premium, andEvent Hubs Dedicatedarticles.Leave thethroughput units(for standard tier) orprocessing units(for premium tier) settings as it is. To learn about throughput units or processing units:Event Hubs scalability.Enable theAuto-inflatefeature if you want Event Hubs to automatically increase the number of TUs to meet usage needs. Increasing TUs prevents throttling scenarios where data ingress or data egress rates exceed the rates allowed by the TUs assigned to the namespace. The Event Hubs service increases the throughput when load increases beyond the minimum threshold, without any requests failing with ServerBusy errors.SelectReview + Createat the bottom of the page.On theReview + Createpage, review the settings, and selectCreate. Wait for the deployment to complete.

Confirm that you see theEvent Hubs namespacepage similar to the following example:NoteAzure Event Hubs provides you with a Kafka endpoint. This endpoint enables your Event Hubs namespace to natively understandApache Kafkamessage protocol and APIs. With this capability, you can communicate with your event hubs as you would with Kafka topics without changing your protocol clients or running your own clusters. Event Hubs supportsApache Kafka versions 1.0and later. For more information, seeUse Event Hubs from Apache Kafka applications.
