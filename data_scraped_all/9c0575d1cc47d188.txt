As you plan your Microsoft Sentinel deployment, you typically want to understand its pricing and billing models to optimize your costs. Microsoft Sentinel's security analytics data is stored in an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace. Billing is based on the volume of dataanalyzedin Microsoft Sentinel andstoredin the Log Analytics workspace. The cost of both is combined in a simplified pricing tier. Learn more about thesimplified pricing tiersor learn more aboutMicrosoft Sentinel pricingin general.
Estimate your costs before you add any resources to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace by finding Microsoft Sentinel in theSecuritysection of theAzure pricing calculator.
Costs for Microsoft Sentinel are only a portion of the monthly costs in your Azure bill. Although this article explains how to plan costs and understand the billing for Microsoft Sentinel, you're billed for all Azure services and resources your Azure subscription uses, including Partner services.
This article is part of theDeployment guide for Microsoft Sentinel.
Important
Microsoft Sentinel is generally available within Microsoft's unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal.
Free trial
Enable Microsoft Sentinel on an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace and the first 10 GB/day is free for 31 days. The cost for both Log Analytics data ingestion and Microsoft Sentinel analysis charges up to the 10 GB/day limit are waived during the 31-day trial period. This free trial is subject to a 20 workspace limit per Azure tenant.
Usage beyond these limits is charged per the pricing listed on theMicrosoft Sentinel pricingpage. Charges related to extra capabilities forautomationandbring your own machine learningare still applicable during the free trial.
During your free trial, find resources for cost management, training, and more on theNews & guides > Free trialtab in Microsoft Sentinel. This tab also displays details about the dates of your free trial, and how many days left until the trial expires.
Identify data sources and plan costs accordingly
Identify the data sources you're ingesting or plan to ingest to your workspace in Microsoft Sentinel. Microsoft Sentinel allows you to bring in data from one or more data sources. Some of these data sources are free, and others incur charges. For more information, seeFree data sources.
Estimate costs and billing before using Microsoft Sentinel
Use theMicrosoft Sentinel pricing calculatorto estimate new or changing costs. EnterMicrosoft Sentinelin the Search box and select the resulting Microsoft Sentinel tile. The pricing calculator helps you estimate your likely costs based on your expected data ingestion and retention.
For example, enter the GB of daily data you expect to ingest in Microsoft Sentinel, and the region for your workspace. The calculator provides the aggregate monthly cost across these components:
Microsoft Sentinel: Analytics logs and auxiliary/basic logs
Azure Monitor: Retention
Azure Monitor: Data Restore
Azure Monitor: Search Queries and Search Jobs
Understand the full billing model for Microsoft Sentinel
Microsoft Sentinel offers a flexible and predictable pricing model. For more information, see theMicrosoft Sentinel pricing page. Workspaces older than July 2023 might have Log Analytics workspace charges separate from Microsoft Sentinel in a classic pricing tier. For the related Log Analytics charges, seeAzure Monitor Log Analytics pricing.
Microsoft Sentinel runs on Azure infrastructure that accrues costs when you deploy new resources. It's important to understand that there could be other, extra infrastructure costs that might accrue.
How you're charged for Microsoft Sentinel
Pricing is based on the types of logs ingested into a workspace. Analytics logs typically make up most of your high value security logs and support all data types offering full analytics, alerts and no query limits. Auxiliary logs and Basic logs tend to be verbose with low security value. It's important to note that billing is done per workspace on a daily basis for all log types and tiers.
There are two ways to pay for the analytics logs:Pay-As-You-GoandCommitment Tiers.
Pay-As-You-Gois the default model, based on the actual data volume stored and optionally for data retention beyond 90 days. Data volume is measured in GB (109bytes).
Pay-As-You-Gois the default model, based on the actual data volume stored and optionally for data retention beyond 90 days. Data volume is measured in GB (109bytes).
Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel haveCommitment Tierpricing, formerly called Capacity Reservations. These pricing tiers are combined into simplified pricing tiers that are more predictable and offer substantial savings compared toPay-As-You-Gopricing.Commitment Tierpricing starts at 100 GB per day. Any usage above the commitment level is billed at the Commitment tier rate you selected. For example, a Commitment tier of100 GB per daybills you for the committed 100 GB data volume, plus any extra GB/day at the discounted effective rate for that tier. TheEffective Per GB Priceis simply theMicrosoft Sentinel Pricedivided by theTierGB per day quantity. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel pricing.Increase your Commitment tier anytime to optimize costs as your data volume increases. Lowering the Commitment tier is only allowed every 31 days. To see your current Microsoft Sentinel pricing tier, selectSettingsin Microsoft Sentinel, and then select thePricingtab. Your current pricing tier is marked asCurrent tier.To set and change your Commitment tier, seeSet or change pricing tier. Switch any workspaces older than July 2023 to the simplified pricing tiers experience to unify billing meters. Or, continue to use the classic pricing tiers that separate out the Log Analytics pricing from the classic Microsoft Sentinel classic pricing. For more information, seesimplified pricing tiers.

Auxiliary logs are a super-low-cost option for ingesting high-volume, low-value data sources. They are charged at a flat, low rate per GB. They have the following limitations, among others:
Reduced querying capabilities
30-day interactive retention
No support for scheduled alerts
This log type is best suited for use in playbook automation, ad-hoc querying, investigations, and search. For more information, see:
Log retention plans in Microsoft Sentinel
Log sources to use for Auxiliary Logs ingestion
Basic logs are a similar option, but less cost-effective.
To learn more about the difference betweeninteractive retentionandlong-term retention(formerly known as archive), seeManage data retention in a Log Analytics workspace.
Simplified pricing tiers
Simplified pricing tiers combine the data analysis costs for Microsoft Sentinel and ingestion storage costs of Log Analytics into a single pricing tier. The following screenshot shows the simplified pricing tier that all new workspaces use.

Switch any workspace configured with classic pricing tiers to the simplified pricing tiers. For more information on how toSwitch to new pricing, seeEnroll in a simplified pricing tier.
Combining the pricing tiers offers a simplification to the overall billing and cost management experience, including visualization in the pricing page, and fewer steps estimating costs in the Azure calculator. To add further value to the new simplified tiers, the current Microsoft Defender for Servers P2 benefit granting 500 MB of security data ingestion into Log Analytics is extended to the simplified pricing tiers. This change greatly increases the financial benefit of bringing eligible data ingested into Microsoft Sentinel for each virtual machine (VM) protected in this manner. For more information, seeFAQ - Microsoft Defender for Servers P2 benefit granting 500 MB.
Understand your Microsoft Sentinel bill
Billable meters are the individual components of your service that appear on your bill and are shown in Microsoft Cost Management. At the end of your billing cycle, the charges for each meter are summed. Your bill or invoice shows a section for all Microsoft Sentinel costs. There's a separate line item for each meter.
To see your Azure bill, selectCost Analysisin the left navigation ofCost Management. On theCost analysisscreen, find and select theInvoice detailsfromAll views.
The costs shown in the following image are for example purposes only. They're not intended to reflect actual costs. Starting July 1, 2023, legacy pricing tiers are prefixed withClassic.

Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics charges might appear on your Azure bill as separate line items based on your selected pricing plan. Simplified pricing tiers are represented as a singlesentinelline item for the pricing tier. Ingestion and analysis are billed on a daily basis. If your workspace exceeds its Commitment tier usage allocation in any given day, the Azure bill shows one line item for the Commitment tier with its associated fixed cost, and a separate line item for the cost beyond the Commitment tier, billed at the same effective Commitment tier rate.

Costs and pricing for other services
Microsoft Sentinel integrates with many other Azure services, including Azure Logic Apps, Azure Notebooks, and bring your own machine learning (BYOML) models. Some of these services might have extra charges. Some of Microsoft Sentinel's data connectors and solutions use Azure Functions for data ingestion, which also has a separate associated cost.

Any other services you use might have associated costs.
Interactive and long-term data retention costs
After you enable Microsoft Sentinel on a Log Analytics workspace, consider these configuration options:
Retain all data ingested into the workspace at no charge for the first 90 days. Retention beyond 90 days is charged per the standardLog Analytics retention prices.
Specify different retention settings for individual data types. Learn aboutretention by data type.
Enable long-term retention for your data so you have access to historical logs. Long-term retention is a low-cost retention state for the preservation of data for such things as regulatory compliance. It's charged based on the volume of data stored and scanned. Learn how toconfigure interactive and long-term data retention policies in Azure Monitor Logs.
Enroll tables that contain secondary security data in theAuxiliary logsplan. This plan allows you to store high-volume, low-value logs at a low price, with a lower-cost 30-day interactive retention period at the beginning to allow for summarization and basic querying. To learn more about the Auxiliary logs plan and other plans, seeLog retention plans in Microsoft Sentinel.
Other CEF ingestion costs
CEF is a supported Syslog events format in Microsoft Sentinel. Use CEF to bring in valuable security information from various sources to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. CEF logs land in the CommonSecurityLog table in Microsoft Sentinel, which includes all the standard up-to-date CEF fields.
Many devices and data sources support logging fields beyond the standard CEF schema. These extra fields land in the AdditionalExtensions table. These fields could have higher ingestion volumes than the standard CEF fields, because the event content within these fields can be variable.
Costs that might accrue after resource deletion
Removing Microsoft Sentinel doesn't remove the Log Analytics workspace Microsoft Sentinel was deployed on, or any separate charges that workspace might be incurring.
