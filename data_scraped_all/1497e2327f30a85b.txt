This article describes the update policy forAzure SQL Managed Instance, and how to modify it. The update policy is an instance setting that controls access to the latest SQL engine features in Azure.
Azure SQL Managed Instance offers the following two update policies:
SQL Server 2022update policy: The instance can only use SQL engine features available in SQL Server 2022 as the internal database format is aligned with SQL Server 2022.
Always-up-to-dateupdate policy: The instance has access to all SQL engine features as soon as they're available in Azure. The internal database format is no longer aligned with the latest version of SQL Server, and instead evolves with each newly introduced feature.
Important
Regardless of the configured update policy, all instances will continue receiving updates and features thatdon'trequire changes to the SQL engine, such as the following features:zone redundancy,instance stop and start, andfast provisioning.
SQL Server 2022 update policy
TheSQL Server 2022update policy aligns your database format with SQL Server 2022.
When using the SQL Server 2022 update policy, consider the following:
TheSQL Server 2022update policy is the default update policy for all existing and newly deployed instances.
Your internal database format remains aligned with SQL Server 2022.
You receive all the latest updates available for SQL Server 2022.
You canrestore your databaseto SQL Server 2022 from Azure SQL Managed Instance.
You can configure alinkfor real-time data replication, bidirectional failover, and disaster recovery between SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Managed Instance.
You might not have access to some of the latest SQL engine features and benefits available to Azure SQL Managed Instance with theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy.
TheSQL Server 2022update policy is available until theend of mainstream support of SQL Server 2022, at which point, the update policy for instances using theSQL Server 2022update policy are automatically updated to the update policy that corresponds to the latest SQL Server major release available at that time.
Always-up-to-date update policy
TheAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy configures your instance to receive all the latest features and updates available to Azure SQL Managed Instance.
When using theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy, consider the following:
You're able to use all the new features and benefits available to Azure SQL Managed Instance.
Once theAlways-up-to-datepolicy is enabled, you can't go back to theSQL Server 2022update policy.
You lose some of the benefits provided by database format alignment with SQL Server 2022, such as the ability to restore your database to SQL Server 2022, and bidirectional failover between your instance and SQL Server 2022 with thelinkfeature.
Feature comparison
The following table lists all the features that are only available to instances with the designated update policy:
The following features are impacted by the configured update policy:
Automated backupsandcopy-only backups: Database backups taken from instances configured with theSQL Server 2022update policy can be restored to instances configured with either theSQL Server 2022orAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy. Database backups taken from instances configured with theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy can only be restored to instances also configured with theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy.
Managed Instance link: Establishing a link from SQL Managed Instance to SQL Server 2022, or failing back from SQL Server 2022 to SQL Managed Instance is only available to instances with theSQL Server 2022update policy.
Database copy and move: A database from an instance configured with theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy can't be copied or moved to an instance configured with theSQL Server 2022update policy.
Failover groups: Instances in a failover group must have matching update policies.
Which update policy to choose?
Unless you're relying on a specific feature that requires theSQL Server 2022update policy, we recommend using theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy. TheAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy provides you with the latest features and benefits available to Azure SQL Managed Instance. While the latest features may not be directly relevant to you, there are still  often improvements to performance, security, and reliability that can benefit your workload.
If you're using theSQL Server 2022update policy to copy databases from SQL Managed Instance to SQL Server for regulatory compliance, contractual obligations, or other reasons important to your business, you can often accomplish the same goals by using other features like database export/import, or transactional replication, or services like Azure Data Factory. Using one of these alternative methods allows you to use theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy with SQL Managed Instance while still meeting your business requirements.
If you are not yet sure what requirements your solution will need, then take your time and start with theSQL Server 2022update policy. You can always switch to theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy later.
You can also use different update policies for different environments. For example, you can use theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy in your development environment to take advantage of the latest features, while using theSQL Server 2022update policy in your production environment to ensure compatibility with SQL Server 2022 for failover scenarios.
Existing instances
For an existing instance, you can enable theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and REST API.
Caution
TheSQL Server 2022update policy is enabled by default for all existing and new instances. Once the update policy is changed toAlways-up-to-date, the internal database format is upgraded permanently. You can't change the update policy back toSQL Server 2022and can no longer use the features and benefits that require the SQL Server 2022 update policy.

Although theSQL Server 2022update policy is enabled by default, you can choose theAlways-up-to-datepolicy when you create your instance by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI and REST API.
Important
Make sure to add update policy configuration to your deployment templates, so that you donât rely on system defaults that may change over time.

Check update policy
You can check the current update policy by using the Azure portal, or Transact-SQL (T-SQL).
To check the current update policy in the Azure portal, go to yourSQL managed instanceresource, and then check theUpdate policyfield underUpdates and maintenancein the resource menu.
You can also use theserverpropertyT-SQL command:
select serverproperty('ProductUpdateType')
select serverproperty('ProductUpdateType')
The following values forProductUpdateTypeindicate the update policy for the current instance:
ProductUpdateType
CU: Updates are deployed via cumulative updates (CUs) for the corresponding major SQL Server release (SQL Server 2022update policy)
CU
Continuous: New features are brought to Azure SQL Managed Instance as soon as they're available, independent of the SQL Server release cadence (Always-up-to-dateupdate policy)
