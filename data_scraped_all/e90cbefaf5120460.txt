This article helps you configure a Network Performance Monitor extension to monitor ExpressRoute. Network Performance Monitor (NPM) is a cloud-based network monitoring solution that monitors connectivity between Azure cloud deployments and on-premises locations (Branch offices, etc.). NPM is part of Azure Monitor logs. NPM offers an extension for ExpressRoute that lets you monitor network performance over ExpressRoute circuits that are configured to use private peering or Microsoft peering. When you configure NPM for ExpressRoute, you can detect network issues to identify and eliminate. This service is also available for Azure Government Cloud.
Important
Starting 1 July 2021, you will not be able to add new tests in an existing workspace or enable a new workspace in Network Performance Monitor. You will also not be able to add new connection monitors in Connection Monitor (classic). You can continue to use the tests and connection monitors created prior to 1 July 2021. To minimize service disruption to your current workloads,migrate your tests from Network Performance Monitorormigrate from Connection Monitor (classic)to the new Connection Monitor in Azure Network Watcher before February 29, 2024.
Note
This article was recently updated to use the term Azure Monitor logs instead of Log Analytics. Log data is still stored in a Log Analytics workspace and is still collected and analyzed by the same Log Analytics service. We are updating the terminology to better reflect the role oflogs in Azure Monitor. SeeAzure Monitor terminology changesfor details.

Workflow
Monitoring agents are installed on multiple servers, both on-premises and in Azure. The agents communicate with each other, but don't send data, they send TCP handshake packets. The communication between the agents allows Azure to map the network topology and path the traffic could take.
Create an NPM Workspace. This workspace is the same as a Log Analytics workspace.
Install and configure software agents. (If you only want to monitor over Microsoft Peering, you don't need to install and configure software agents.):Install monitoring agents on the on-premises servers and the Azure VMs (for private peering).Configure settings on the monitoring agent servers to allow the monitoring agents to communicate. (Open firewall ports, etc.)
Install monitoring agents on the on-premises servers and the Azure VMs (for private peering).
Configure settings on the monitoring agent servers to allow the monitoring agents to communicate. (Open firewall ports, etc.)
Configure network security group (NSG) rules to allow the monitoring agent installed on Azure VMs to communicate with on-premises monitoring agents.
Set up monitoring: Auto-Discover and manage which networks are visible in NPM.
If you're already using Network Performance Monitor to monitor other objects or services, and you already have Workspace in one of the supported regions, you can skip Step 1 and Step 2, and begin your configuration with Step 3.

2.2: Install a monitoring agent on each monitoring server (on each VNET that you want to monitor)
We recommend that you install at least two agents on each side of the ExpressRoute connection for redundancy (for example, on-premises, Azure VNETs). The agent must be installed on a Windows Server (2008 SP1 or later). Monitoring ExpressRoute circuits using Windows Desktop OS and Linux OS isn't supported. Use the following steps to install agents:
Note
Agents pushed by SCOM (includesMMA) may not be able to consistently detect their location if they are hosted in Azure. We recommend that you do not use these agents in Azure VNETs to monitor ExpressRoute.
RunSetupto install the agent on each server that you want to use for monitoring ExpressRoute. The server you use for monitoring can either be a VM, or on-premises, and must have Internet access. You need to install at least one agent on-premises, and one agent on each network segment that you want to monitor in Azure.

2.3: Configure proxy settings (optional)
If you're using a web proxy to access the Internet, use the following steps to configure proxy settings for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent. Perform these steps for each server. If you have many servers that you need to configure, you might find it easier to use a script to automate this process. If so, seeTo configure proxy settings for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent using a script.

In theStatuscolumn, you should see that the agent connected successfully to Azure Monitor logs.

2.5: Open the firewall ports on the monitoring agent servers
To use the TCP protocol, you must open firewall ports to ensure that the monitoring agents can communicate.
You can run a PowerShell script to create the registry keys that required by the Network Performance Monitor. This script also creates the Windows Firewall rules to allow monitoring agents to create TCP connections with each other. The registry keys created by the script specify whether to log the debug logs, and the path for the logs file. It also defines the agent TCP port used for communication. The values for these keys get set automatically by the script. You shouldn't manually change these keys.
Port 8084 is opened by default. You can use a custom port by providing the parameter 'portNumber' to the script. However, if you do so, you must specify the same port for all the servers on which you run the script.
Note
The 'EnableRules' PowerShell script configures Windows Firewall rules only on the server where the script is run. If you have a network firewall, you should make sure that it allows traffic destined for the TCP port being used by Network Performance Monitor.
On the agent servers, open a PowerShell window with administrative privileges. Run theEnableRulesPowerShell script (which you downloaded earlier). Don't use any parameters.

Step 3: Configure network security group rules
To monitor agent servers that are in Azure, you must configure network security group (NSG) rules to allow TCP traffic on a port used by NPM for synthetic transactions. The default port is 8084, allowing a monitoring agent installed on an Azure VM to communicate with an on-premises monitoring agent.
For more information about NSG, seeNetwork Security Groups.
Note
Make sure that you have installed the agents (both the on-premises server agent and the Azure server agent), and have run the PowerShell script before proceeding with this step.
Step 4: Discover peering connections
Navigate to the Network Performance Monitor overview tile by going to theAll Resourcespage, then select on the allowlisted NPM Workspace.

All of the private peering connections that connect to the VNets associated with this subscription.
Step 5: Configure monitors
In this section, you configure the monitors. Follow the steps for the type of peering that you want to monitor:private peering, orMicrosoft peering.
Private peering
For private peering, when discovery completes, you see rules for uniqueCircuit NameandVNet Name. Initially, these rules are disabled.

Check theMonitor this peeringcheckbox.
Select the checkboxEnable Health Monitoring for this peering.
Choose the monitoring conditions. You can set custom thresholds to generate health events by typing threshold values. Whenever the value of the condition goes above its selected threshold for the selected network/subnetwork pair, a health event is generated.
Select the ON-PREM AGENTSAdd Agentsbutton to add the on-premises servers from which you want to monitor the private peering connection. Make sure that you only choose agents that have connectivity to the Microsoft service endpoint that you specified in the section for Step 2. The on-premises agents must be able to reach the endpoint using the ExpressRoute connection.
Save the settings.
After enabling the rules and selecting the values and agents you want to monitor, there's a wait of approximately 30-60 minutes for the values to begin populating and theExpressRoute Monitoringtiles to become available.
Microsoft peering
For Microsoft peering, select the Microsoft peering connection(s) that you want to monitor, and configure the settings.
Check theMonitor this peeringcheckbox.
(Optional) You can change the target Microsoft service endpoint. By default, NPM chooses a Microsoft service endpoint as the target. NPM monitors connectivity from your on-premises servers to this target endpoint through ExpressRoute.To change this target endpoint, select the(edit)link underTarget:, and select another Microsoft service target endpoint from the list of URLs.You can use a custom URL or IP Address. This option is relevant if you're using Microsoft peering to establish a connection to Azure PaaS services, such as Azure Storage, SQL databases, and Websites that are offered on public IP addresses. Select the link(Use custom URL or IP Address instead)at the bottom of the URL list, then enter the public endpoint of your Azure PaaS service that is connected through the ExpressRoute Microsoft peering.If you're using these optional settings, make sure that only the Microsoft service endpoint is selected here. The endpoint must be connected to ExpressRoute and reachable by the on-premises agents.

Save the settings.
After enabling the rules and selecting the values and agents you want to monitor, there's a wait of approximately 30-60 minutes for the values to begin populating and theExpressRoute Monitoringtiles to become available.
Step 6: View monitoring tiles
Once you see the monitoring tiles, your ExpressRoute circuits and connection resources gets monitored by NPM. You can select on Microsoft Peering tile to drill down on the health of Microsoft Peering connections.

Network Performance Monitor page
The NPM page contains a page for ExpressRoute that shows an overview of the health of ExpressRoute circuits and peerings.

List of circuits
To view a list of all monitored ExpressRoute circuits, select theExpressRoute circuitstile. You can select a circuit and view its health state, trend charts for packet loss, bandwidth utilization, and latency. The charts are interactive. You can select a custom time window for plotting the charts. You can drag the mouse over an area on the chart to zoom in and see fine-grained data points.

The bandwidth, latency, and loss charts are interactive. You can zoom into any section of these charts, using mouse controls. You can also see the bandwidth, latency, and loss data for other intervals by clickingDate/Time, located below the Actions button on the upper left.

Peerings list
To view list of all connections to virtual networks over private peering, select thePrivate Peeringstile on the dashboard. Here, you can select a virtual network connection and view its health state, trend charts for packet loss, bandwidth utilization, and latency.

Nodes view
To view list of all the links between the on-premises nodes and Azure VMs/Microsoft service endpoints for the chosen ExpressRoute peering connection, selectView node links. You can view the health status of each link, and the trend of loss and latency associated with them.

Circuit topology
To view circuit topology, select theTopologytile. The topology diagram provides the latency for each segment on the network. Each layer 3 hop gets represented by a node of the diagram. Clicking on a hop reveals more details about the hop.
You can increase the level of visibility to include on-premises hops by moving the slider bar belowFilters. Moving the slider bar left or right increases or decreases the number of hops in the topology graph. The latency across each segment is visible, which allows for faster isolation of high latency segments on your network.

This view shows VNet connections.
