Azure Virtual Desktop usesAzure Monitorfor monitoring and alerts like many other Azure services. This lets admins identify issues through a single interface. The service creates activity logs for both user and administrative actions. Each activity log falls under the following categories:
Connections that don't reach Azure Virtual Desktop won't show up in diagnostics results because the diagnostics role service itself is part of Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop connection issues can happen when the user is experiencing network connectivity issues.
Azure Monitor lets you analyze Azure Virtual Desktop data and review virtual machine (VM) performance counters, all within the same tool. This article will tell you more about how to enable diagnostics for your Azure Virtual Desktop environment.
Note
To learn how to monitor your VMs in Azure, seeMonitoring Azure virtual machines with Azure Monitor. Also, make sure to review theAzure Virtual Desktop Insights glossaryfor a better understanding of your user experience on the session host.
Prerequisites
Before you can use Azure Virtual Desktop with Log Analytics, you need:
A Log Analytics workspace. For more information, seeCreate a Log Analytics workspace in Azure portalorCreate a Log Analytics workspace with PowerShell. After you've created your workspace, follow the instructions inConnect Windows computers to Azure Monitorto get the following information:The workspace IDThe primary key of your workspaceYou'll need this information later in the setup process.

Push diagnostics data to your workspace
You can push diagnostics data from your Azure Virtual Desktop objects into the Log Analytics for your workspace. You can set up this feature right away when you first create your objects.
To set up Log Analytics for a new object:
Sign in to the Azure portal and go toAzure Virtual Desktop.
Sign in to the Azure portal and go toAzure Virtual Desktop.
Navigate to the object (such as a host pool, application group, or workspace) that you want to capture logs and events for.

SelectAdd diagnostic settingin the menu that appears on the right side of the screen.The options shown in the Diagnostic Settings page will vary depending on what kind of object you're editing.For example, when you're enabling diagnostics for an application group, you'll see options to configure checkpoints, errors, and management. For workspaces, these categories configure a feed to track when users subscribe to the list of apps. To learn more about diagnostic settings seeCreate diagnostic setting to collect resource logs and metrics in Azure.ImportantRemember to enable diagnostics for each Azure Resource Manager object that you want to monitor. Data will be available for activities after diagnostics has been enabled. It might take a few hours after first set-up.

Note
For more detailed information about the tables stored in Azure Monitor Logs, see theAzure Monitor data reference. All tables related to Azure Virtual Desktop are prefixed with "WVD."
Cadence for sending diagnostic events
Diagnostic events are sent to Log Analytics when completed.
Log Analytics only reports in these intermediate states for connection activities:
Started: when a user selects and connects to an app or desktop in the Remote Desktop client.
Connected: when the user successfully connects to the VM where the app or desktop is hosted.
Completed: when the user or server disconnects the session the activity took place in.
Example queries
Access example queries through the Azure Monitor Log Analytics UI:
Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then selectLogs. The example query UI is shown automatically.
Change the filter toCategory.
SelectAzure Virtual Desktopto review available queries.
SelectRunto run the selected query.
Learn more about the sample query interface inSaved queries in Azure Monitor Log Analytics.
The following query list lets you review connection information or issues for a single user. You can run these queries in theLog Analytics query editor. For each query, replaceuserupnwith the UPN of the user you want to look up.
userupn
To find all connections for a single user:
WVDConnections
|where UserName == "userupn"
|take 100
|sort by TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId
WVDConnections
|where UserName == "userupn"
|take 100
|sort by TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId
To find the number of times a user connected per day:
WVDConnections
|where UserName == "userupn"
|take 100
|sort by TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId
|summarize dcount(CorrelationId) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
WVDConnections
|where UserName == "userupn"
|take 100
|sort by TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId
|summarize dcount(CorrelationId) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
To find session duration by user:
let Events = WVDConnections | where UserName == "userupn" ;
Events
| where State == "Connected"
| project CorrelationId , UserName, ResourceAlias , StartTime=TimeGenerated
| join (Events
| where State == "Completed"
| project EndTime=TimeGenerated, CorrelationId)
on CorrelationId
| project Duration = EndTime - StartTime, ResourceAlias
| sort by Duration asc
let Events = WVDConnections | where UserName == "userupn" ;
Events
| where State == "Connected"
| project CorrelationId , UserName, ResourceAlias , StartTime=TimeGenerated
| join (Events
| where State == "Completed"
| project EndTime=TimeGenerated, CorrelationId)
on CorrelationId
| project Duration = EndTime - StartTime, ResourceAlias
| sort by Duration asc
To find errors for a specific user:
WVDErrors
| where UserName == "userupn"
|take 100
WVDErrors
| where UserName == "userupn"
|take 100
To find out whether a specific error occurred for other users:
WVDErrors
| where CodeSymbolic =="ErrorSymbolicCode"
| summarize count(UserName) by CodeSymbolic
WVDErrors
| where CodeSymbolic =="ErrorSymbolicCode"
| summarize count(UserName) by CodeSymbolic
Note
When a user launches a full desktop session, their app usage in the session isn't tracked as checkpoints in theWVDCheckpointstable.
WVDCheckpoints
TheResourcesAliascolumn in theWVDConnectionstable shows whether a user has connected to a full desktop or a published app. The column only shows the first app they open during the connection. Any published apps the user opens are tracked inWVDCheckpoints.
ResourcesAlias
WVDConnections
WVDCheckpoints
TheWVDErrorstable shows you management errors, host registration issues, and other issues that happen while the user subscribes to a list of apps or desktops.
WVDErrors
TheWVDErrorstable also helps you to identify issues that can be resolved by admin tasks. The value onServiceErrorshould always equalfalsefor these types of issues. IfServiceErrorequalstrue, you'll need to escalate the issue to Microsoft. Ensure you provide theCorrelationIDfor errors you escalate.
WVDErrors
ServiceError
false
ServiceError
true
When debugging connectivity issues, in some cases client information might be missing even if the connection events completes. This applies to theWVDConnectionsandWVDCheckpointstables.
