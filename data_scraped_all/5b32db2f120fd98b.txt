App Service, Functions, and Logic Apps on Azure Arc (Preview)

You can run App Service, Functions, and Logic Apps on an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster can be on-premises or hosted in a third-party cloud. This approach lets app developers take advantage of the features of App Service. At the same time, it lets their IT administrators maintain corporate compliance by hosting the App Service apps on internal infrastructure. It also lets other IT operators safeguard their prior investments in other cloud providers by running App Service on existing Kubernetes clusters.
Note
To learn how to set up your Kubernetes cluster for App Service, Functions, and Logic Apps, seeCreate an App Service Kubernetes environment (Preview).
In most cases, app developers need to know nothing more than how to deploy to the correct Azure region that represents the deployed Kubernetes environment. For operators who provide the environment and maintain the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure, you must be aware of the following Azure resources:
The connected cluster, which is an Azure projection of your Kubernetes infrastructure. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes?.
A cluster extension, which is a subresource of the connected cluster resource. The App Service extensioninstalls the required pods into your connected cluster. For more information about cluster extensions, seeCluster extensions on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.
A custom location, which bundles together a group of extensions and maps them to a namespace for created resources. For more information, seeCustom locations on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.
An App Service Kubernetes environment, which enables configuration common across apps but not related to cluster operations. Conceptually, it's deployed into the custom location resource, and app developers create apps into this environment. This resource is described in greater detail inApp Service Kubernetes environment.
Public preview limitations
The following public preview limitations apply to App Service Kubernetes environments. This list of limitations is updated as changes and features are made available.
LoadBalancer
Pods created by the App Service extension
When the App Service extension is installed on the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, several pods are created in the release namespace that was specified. These pods enable your Kubernetes cluster to be an extension of theMicrosoft.Webresource provider in Azure and support the management and operation of your apps. Optionally, you can choose to have the extension installKEDAfor event-driven scaling.
Microsoft.Web
The following table describes the role of each pod that is created by default:
<extensionName>-k8se-app-controller
<extensionName>-k8se-envoy
<extensionName>-k8se-activator
<extensionName>-k8se-build-service
<extensionName>-k8se-http-scaler
<extensionName>-k8se-img-cacher
<extensionName>-k8se-log-processor

App Service Kubernetes environment
The App Service Kubernetes environment resource is required before apps can be created. It enables configuration common to apps in the custom location, such as the default DNS suffix.
Only one Kubernetes environment resource can be created in a custom location. In most cases, a developer who creates and deploys apps doesn't need to be directly aware of the resource. It can be directly inferred from the provided custom location ID. However, when defining Azure Resource Manager templates, any plan resource needs to reference the resource ID of the environment directly. The custom location values of the plan and the specified environment must match.

Are both Windows and Linux apps supported?
Only Linux-based apps are supported, both code and custom containers. Windows apps aren't supported.
Can the extension be installed on Windows nodes?
No, the extension cannot be installed on Windows nodes. The extension supports installation onLinuxnodesonly.
Which built-in application stacks are supported?
All built-in Linux stacks are supported.
Are all app deployment types supported?
FTP deployment isn't supported. Currentlyaz webapp upis also not supported. Other deployment methods are supported, including Git, ZIP, CI/CD, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code.
az webapp up
Which App Service features are supported?
During the preview period, certain App Service features are being validated. When they're supported, their left navigation options in the Azure portal will be activated. Features that aren't yet supported remain grayed out.
Are all networking features supported?
No. Networking features such as hybrid connections or Virtual Network integration, aren't supported.Access restrictionsupport was added in April 2022. Networking should be handled directly in the networking rules in the Kubernetes cluster itself.
Are managed identities supported?
No. Apps cannot be assigned managed identities when running in Azure Arc. If your app needs an identity for working with another Azure resource, consider using anapplication service principalinstead.
Are there any scaling limits?
All applications deployed with Azure App Service on Kubernetes with Azure Arc are able to scale within the limits of the underlying Kubernetes cluster. If the underlying Kubernetes Cluster runs out of available compute resources (CPU and memory primarily), then applications will only be able to scale to the number of instances of the application that Kubernetes can schedule with available resource.
What logs are collected?
Logs for both system components and your applications are written to standard output. Both log types can be collected for analysis using standard Kubernetes tools. You can also configure the App Service cluster extension with aLog Analytics workspace, and it sends all logs to that workspace.
By default, logs from system components are sent to the Azure team. Application logs aren't sent. You can prevent these logs from being transferred by settinglogProcessor.enabled=falseas an extension configuration setting. This configuration setting will also disable forwarding of application to your Log Analytics workspace. Disabling the log processor might impact time needed for any support cases, and you will be asked to collect logs from standard output through some other means.
logProcessor.enabled=false
What do I do if I see a provider registration error?
When creating a Kubernetes environment resource, some subscriptions might see a "No registered resource provider found" error. The error details might include a set of locations and API versions that are considered valid. If this error message is returned, the subscription must be re-registered with the Microsoft.Web provider, an operation that has no impact on existing applications or APIs. To re-register, use the Azure CLI to runaz provider register --namespace Microsoft.Web --wait. Then reattempt the Kubernetes environment command.
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Web --wait
Can I deploy the Application services extension on an Arm64 based cluster?
Arm64 based clusters aren't supported at this time.
Which Kubernetes distributions can I deploy the extension on?
The extension has been validated on AKS, AKS on Azure Local, Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service and Kubernetes Cluster API.
