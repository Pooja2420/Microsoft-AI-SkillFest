When you create a logical server from theAzure portalfor Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics, the result is a public endpoint in the format:yourservername.database.windows.net.
yourservername.database.windows.net
By default, the logical server denies all connections to ensure security. You can use one or more of the following network access controls to selectively allow access to a database via thepublic endpoint
IP based firewall rules: Use this feature to explicitly allow connections from a specific IP address. For example, from on-premises machines or a range of IP addresses by specifying the start and end IP address.

IP firewall rules
IP based firewall rules is a feature of the logical server in Azure that prevents all access to your server until you explicitlyadd IP addressesof the client machines.
There are two types of firewall rules:
Server-level firewall rules: These rules apply to all databases on the server. They can be configured through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or T-SQL commands likesp_set_firewall_rule.
Database-level firewall rules: These rules apply to individual databases and canonlybe configured using T-SQL commands likesp_set_database_firewall_rule
The following are constraints for naming firewall rules:
The firewall rule name can't be empty.
It can't contain the following characters:<, >, *, %, &, :, \\, /, ?.
<, >, *, %, &, :, \\, /, ?.
It can't end with a period (.).
The firewall rule name cannot exceed 128 characters.
Any attempts to create firewall rules that do not meet these constraints fails with an error message. Any modifications made to existing IP based firewall rules can take up to 5 minutes to take effect.
Allow Azure services
By default, during creation of a new logical serverfrom the Azure portal,Allow Azure services and resources to access this serveris unchecked and not enabled. This setting appears when connectivity is allowed via public endpoint.
You can also change this setting via theNetworkingsetting after the logical server is created as follows:

WhenAllow Azure services and resources to access this serveris enabled, your server allows communications from all resources inside the Azure boundary,regardless of whether they are part of your subscription. Behind the scenes, a special server-level firewall rule is added that starts and ends with IP address of0.0.0.0.
0.0.0.0
In many cases, enabling the setting is more permissive than what most customers want. You might want to uncheck this setting and replace it with more restrictive IP firewall rules or use one the options for private access.
Important
CheckingAllow Azure services and resources to access this serveradds an IP based firewall rule with start and end IP address of 0.0.0.0
However, doing so affects the following features that run on virtual machines in Azure that aren't part of your virtual network and hence connect to the database via an Azure IP address:
Import Export Service
Import Export Service doesn't work whenAllow Azure services and resources to access this serverisn't enabled. However you can work around the problemby manually running SqlPackage from an Azure VM or performing the exportdirectly in your code by using the DACFx API.
Data Sync
To use the Data sync feature withAllow Azure services and resources to access this servernot enabled, you need to create individual firewall rule entries toadd IP addressesfrom theSql service tagfor the region hosting theHubdatabase. Add these server-level firewall rules to the servers hosting bothHubandMemberdatabases (which might be in different regions).
Use the following PowerShell script to generate IP addresses corresponding to the SQL service tag for West US region.
PS C:\>  $serviceTags = Get-AzNetworkServiceTag -Location eastus2
PS C:\>  $sql = $serviceTags.Values | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Sql.WestUS" }
PS C:\> $sql.Properties.AddressPrefixes.Count
70
PS C:\> $sql.Properties.AddressPrefixes
13.86.216.0/25
13.86.216.128/26
13.86.216.192/27
13.86.217.0/25
13.86.217.128/26
13.86.217.192/27
PS C:\>  $serviceTags = Get-AzNetworkServiceTag -Location eastus2
PS C:\>  $sql = $serviceTags.Values | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "Sql.WestUS" }
PS C:\> $sql.Properties.AddressPrefixes.Count
70
PS C:\> $sql.Properties.AddressPrefixes
13.86.216.0/25
13.86.216.128/26
13.86.216.192/27
13.86.217.0/25
13.86.217.128/26
13.86.217.192/27
Tip
Get-AzNetworkServiceTag returns the global range for SQL Service Tag despite specifying the Location parameter. Be sure to filter it to the region that hosts the Hub database used by your sync group
The output of the PowerShell script is in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. This needs to be converted to a format of Start and End IP address usingGet-IPrangeStartEnd.ps1like this:
PS C:\> Get-IPrangeStartEnd -ip 52.229.17.93 -cidr 26
start        end
-----        ---
52.229.17.64 52.229.17.127
PS C:\> Get-IPrangeStartEnd -ip 52.229.17.93 -cidr 26
start        end
-----        ---
52.229.17.64 52.229.17.127
You can use the following PowerShell script to convert all the IP addresses from CIDR to Start and End IP address format.
PS C:\>foreach( $i in $sql.Properties.AddressPrefixes) {$ip,$cidr= $i.split('/') ; Get-IPrangeStartEnd -ip $ip -cidr $cidr;}
start          end
-----          ---
13.86.216.0    13.86.216.127
13.86.216.128  13.86.216.191
13.86.216.192  13.86.216.223
PS C:\>foreach( $i in $sql.Properties.AddressPrefixes) {$ip,$cidr= $i.split('/') ; Get-IPrangeStartEnd -ip $ip -cidr $cidr;}
start          end
-----          ---
13.86.216.0    13.86.216.127
13.86.216.128  13.86.216.191
13.86.216.192  13.86.216.223
You can now add these as distinct firewall rules and then disable the settingAllow Azure services and resources to access this server.
Sql Service Tag
Service tagscan be used in security rules and routes from clients to SQL Database. Service tags can be used in network security groups, Azure Firewall, and user-defined routes by specifying them in the source or destination field of a security rule.
TheSqlservice tag consists of all IP addresses that are being used by SQL Database. The tag is further segmented by regions. For exampleSql.WestUSlists all the IP addresses used by SQL Database in West US.
TheSqlservice tag consists of IP addresses that are required to establish connectivity to SQL Database as documented inGateway IP addresses. Additionally, a service tag will also be associated with any outbound traffic from SQL Database used in features such as:
Auditing
Vulnerability assessment
Import/Export service
OPENROWSET
Bulk Insert
sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
Ledger
Azure SQL transparent data encryption with customer-managed key
SqlManagement Service Tag
SqlManagement service tag is used for control plane operations against SQL Database.
Virtual network firewall rules
Virtual network firewall rulesare easier alternatives to establish and manage access from a specific subnet that contains your VMs.
Private Link
Private Link allows you to connect to a server via aprivate endpoint. Aprivate endpointis a private IP address within a specificvirtual networkand subnet.
