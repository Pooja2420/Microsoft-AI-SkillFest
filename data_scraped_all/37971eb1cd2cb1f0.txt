This article shows you how to configure IP restriction rules in a web application firewall (WAF) for Azure Front Door by using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or an Azure Resource Manager template.
An IP addressâbased access control rule is a custom WAF rule that lets you control access to your web applications. The rule specifies a list of IP addresses or IP address ranges in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format.
There are two types of match variables in an IP address match:RemoteAddrandSocketAddr. TheRemoteAddrvariable is the original client IP that's usually sent via theX-Forwarded-Forrequest header. TheSocketAddrvariable is the source IP address the WAF sees. If your user is behind a proxy,SocketAddris often the proxy server address.

By default, your web application is accessible from the internet. If you want to limit access to clients from a list of known IP addresses or IP address ranges, you can create an IP matching rule that contains the list of IP addresses as matching values and sets the operator toNot(negate is true) and the action toBlock. After an IP restriction rule is applied, requests that originate from addresses outside this allowed list receive a 403 Forbidden response.

Follow these steps to configure a WAF policy using the Azure CLI.
Prerequisites
Before you begin to configure an IP restriction policy, set up your CLI environment and create an Azure Front Door profile.
Install theAzure CLIor use Azure Cloud Shell. Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It has the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Select theTry itbutton in the CLI commands that follow. Then sign in to your Azure account in the Cloud Shell session that opens. After the session starts, enteraz extension add --name front-doorto add the Azure Front Door extension.
az extension add --name front-door
If you're using the CLI locally in Bash, sign in to Azure by usingaz login.
az login
Create an Azure Front Door profile by following the instructions described inQuickstart: Create an Azure Front Door instance for a highly available global web application.
Create a WAF policy
Create a WAF policy by using theaz network front-door waf-policy createcommand.
In the example that follows, replace the policy nameIPAllowPolicyExampleCLIwith a unique policy name.
az network front-door waf-policy create \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --subscription <subscription ID> \
  --name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
az network front-door waf-policy create \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --subscription <subscription ID> \
  --name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
Add a custom IP access control rule
Use theaz network front-door waf-policy custom-rule createcommand to add a custom IP access control rule for the WAF policy you created.
In the following examples:
ReplaceIPAllowPolicyExampleCLIwith your unique policy created earlier.
Replaceip-address-range-1,ip-address-range-2with your own range.
First, create an IP allow rule for the policy created from the previous step.
Note
--deferis required because a rule must have a match condition to be added in the next step.
--defer
az network front-door waf-policy rule create \
  --name IPAllowListRule \
  --priority 1 \
  --rule-type MatchRule \
  --action Block \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --policy-name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI --defer
az network front-door waf-policy rule create \
  --name IPAllowListRule \
  --priority 1 \
  --rule-type MatchRule \
  --action Block \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --policy-name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI --defer
Next, add a match condition to the rule:
az network front-door waf-policy rule match-condition add \
--match-variable SocketAddr \
--operator IPMatch \
--values "ip-address-range-1" "ip-address-range-2" \
--negate true \
--name IPAllowListRule \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --policy-name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
az network front-door waf-policy rule match-condition add \
--match-variable SocketAddr \
--operator IPMatch \
--values "ip-address-range-1" "ip-address-range-2" \
--negate true \
--name IPAllowListRule \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --policy-name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
Find the ID of a WAF policy
Find a WAF policy's ID by using theaz network front-door waf-policy showcommand. ReplaceIPAllowPolicyExampleCLIin the following example with your unique policy that you created earlier.
az network front-door  waf-policy show \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
az network front-door  waf-policy show \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
Link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front-end host
Set the Azure Front DoorWebApplicationFirewallPolicyLinkID to the policy ID by using theaz network front-door updatecommand. ReplaceIPAllowPolicyExampleCLIwith your unique policy that you created earlier.
az network front-door update \
  --set FrontendEndpoints[0].WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id=/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourcegroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.Network/frontdoorwebapplicationfirewallpolicies/IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI \
  --name <frontdoor-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name>
az network front-door update \
  --set FrontendEndpoints[0].WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id=/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourcegroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.Network/frontdoorwebapplicationfirewallpolicies/IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI \
  --name <frontdoor-name> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name>
In this example, the WAF policy is applied toFrontendEndpoints[0]. You can link the WAF policy to any of your front ends.
FrontendEndpoints[0]
Note
You need to set theWebApplicationFirewallPolicyLinkproperty only once to link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front end. Subsequent policy updates are automatically applied to the front end.

Follow these steps to configure a WAF policy using Azure PowerShell.
Prerequisites
Before you begin to configure an IP restriction policy, set up your PowerShell environment and create an Azure Front Door profile.
Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use theAzure Resource Managermodel for managing Azure resources.
You can installAzure PowerShellon your local machine and use it in any PowerShell session. Follow the instructions on the page to sign in to PowerShell by using your Azure credentials and then install the Az PowerShell module module.
Connect to Azure by using the following command and then use an interactive dialog to sign in.Connect-AzAccount

Install the Az.FrontDoor module by using the following command:Install-Module -Name Az.FrontDoor
Install the Az.FrontDoor module by using the following command:
Install-Module -Name Az.FrontDoor
Install-Module -Name Az.FrontDoor
Create an Azure Front Door profile
Create an Azure Front Door profile by following the instructions described inQuickstart: Create a Front Door for a highly available global web application.
Define an IP match condition
Use theNew-AzFrontDoorWafMatchConditionObjectcommand to define an IP match condition.
In the following example, replaceip-address-range-1,ip-address-range-2with your own range.
$IPMatchCondition = New-AzFrontDoorWafMatchConditionObject `
-MatchVariable  SocketAddr `
-OperatorProperty IPMatch `
-MatchValue "ip-address-range-1", "ip-address-range-2"
-NegateCondition 1
$IPMatchCondition = New-AzFrontDoorWafMatchConditionObject `
-MatchVariable  SocketAddr `
-OperatorProperty IPMatch `
-MatchValue "ip-address-range-1", "ip-address-range-2"
-NegateCondition 1
Create a custom IP allow rule
Use theNew-AzFrontDoorWafCustomRuleObjectcommand to define an action and set a priority. In the following example, requests not from client IPs that match the list are blocked.
$IPAllowRule = New-AzFrontDoorWafCustomRuleObject `
-Name "IPAllowRule" `
-RuleType MatchRule `
-MatchCondition $IPMatchCondition `
-Action Block -Priority 1
$IPAllowRule = New-AzFrontDoorWafCustomRuleObject `
-Name "IPAllowRule" `
-RuleType MatchRule `
-MatchCondition $IPMatchCondition `
-Action Block -Priority 1
Configure a WAF policy
Find the name of the resource group that contains the Azure Front Door profile by usingGet-AzResourceGroup. Next, configure a WAF policy with the IP rule by usingNew-AzFrontDoorWafPolicy.
Get-AzResourceGroup
$IPAllowPolicyExamplePS = New-AzFrontDoorWafPolicy `
    -Name "IPRestrictionExamplePS" `
    -resourceGroupName <resource-group-name> `
    -Customrule $IPAllowRule`
    -Mode Prevention `
    -EnabledState Enabled
$IPAllowPolicyExamplePS = New-AzFrontDoorWafPolicy `
    -Name "IPRestrictionExamplePS" `
    -resourceGroupName <resource-group-name> `
    -Customrule $IPAllowRule`
    -Mode Prevention `
    -EnabledState Enabled
Tip
For an existing WAF policy, you can useUpdate-AzFrontDoorWafPolicyto update the policy.
Link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front-end host
Link a WAF policy object to an existing front-end host and update Azure Front Door properties. First, retrieve the Azure Front Door object by usingGet-AzFrontDoor. Next, set theWebApplicationFirewallPolicyLinkproperty to the resource ID of$IPAllowPolicyExamplePS, created in the previous step, by using theSet-AzFrontDoorcommand.
WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink
$IPAllowPolicyExamplePS
$FrontDoorObjectExample = Get-AzFrontDoor `
    -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> `
    -Name $frontDoorName
  $FrontDoorObjectExample[0].FrontendEndpoints[0].WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink = $IPBlockPolicy.Id
  Set-AzFrontDoor -InputObject $FrontDoorObjectExample[0]
$FrontDoorObjectExample = Get-AzFrontDoor `
    -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> `
    -Name $frontDoorName
  $FrontDoorObjectExample[0].FrontendEndpoints[0].WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink = $IPBlockPolicy.Id
  Set-AzFrontDoor -InputObject $FrontDoorObjectExample[0]
Note
In this example, the WAF policy is applied toFrontendEndpoints[0]. You can link a WAF policy to any of your front ends. You need to set theWebApplicationFirewallPolicyLinkproperty only once to link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front end. Subsequent policy updates are automatically applied to the front end.
