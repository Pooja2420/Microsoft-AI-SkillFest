Returns an approximation for the most popular distinct values, or the values
with the largest sum, in the input.
Note
top-hittersuses an approximation algorithm optimized for performance
when the input data is large.
The approximation is based on theCount-Min-Sketchalgorithm.

Note
When you includeSummingExpressionin the syntax, the query is equivalent to:T | summarize S = sum(SummingExpression) by ValueExpression | top NumberOfValues by S desc
When you includeSummingExpressionin the syntax, the query is equivalent to:
T | summarize S = sum(SummingExpression) by ValueExpression | top NumberOfValues by S desc
T | summarize S = sum(SummingExpression) by ValueExpression | top NumberOfValues by S desc
When you don't includeSummingExpressionin the syntax, the query is equivalent to:T | summarize C = count() by ValueExpression | top NumberOfValues by C desc
When you don't includeSummingExpressionin the syntax, the query is equivalent to:
T | summarize C = count() by ValueExpression | top NumberOfValues by C desc
T | summarize C = count() by ValueExpression | top NumberOfValues by C desc
Examples
The examples in this section show how to use the syntax to help you get started.
The examples in this article use publicly available tables in thehelp cluster, such as theStormEventstable in theSamplesdatabase.

StormEvents
Get top 2 events by totals
This example summarizes storm event data by calculating the total number of events for each event type. The query then selects the top two event types with the highest total number of events.
Run the query
StormEvents
| summarize TotalEventId = sum(EventId) by EventType
| top 2 by TotalEventId desc
StormEvents
| summarize TotalEventId = sum(EventId) by EventType
| top 2 by TotalEventId desc
Output
Get most frequent items
This example shows how to find the top-5 types of storms.
Run the query
StormEvents
| top-hitters 5 of EventType
StormEvents
| top-hitters 5 of EventType
Output
Get top hitters based on column value
This example shows how to find the States with the mostThunderstorm Windevents.
Run the query
StormEvents
| where EventType == "Thunderstorm Wind"
| top-hitters 10 of State
StormEvents
| where EventType == "Thunderstorm Wind"
| top-hitters 10 of State
Output
