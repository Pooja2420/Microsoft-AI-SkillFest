extensionto PostgreSQL)
Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL provides self-service
scaling to deal with increased load. The Azure portal makes it easy to add new
worker nodes, and to increase the vCores and storage for existing nodes.
Adding nodes causes no downtime, and even moving shards to the new nodes (calledshard
rebalancing) happens without interrupting
queries.
Add worker nodes
On the portal page for your cluster, selectScalefrom the left menu.
On the portal page for your cluster, selectScalefrom the left menu.
On theScalepage, underNodes, select a new value forNode count.
On theScalepage, underNodes, select a new value forNode count.

SelectSaveto apply the changed values.

Note
Once you increase nodes and save, you can't decrease the number of worker nodes by using thisScalepage.
Note
To take advantage of newly added nodes you mustrebalance distributed table
shards, which means moving someshardsfrom existing nodes
to the new ones. Rebalancing can work in the background, and requires no
downtime.
Increase or decrease vCores on nodes
You can increase the capabilities of existing nodes. Adjusting compute capacity up and down can be useful for performance
experiments, and short- or long-term changes to traffic demands.
To change the vCores for all worker nodes, on theScalescreen, select a new value underCompute per node. To adjust the coordinator's vCores, expandCoordinatorand select a new value underCoordinator compute.
Note
You can scale compute oncluster read replicasindependent of their primary cluster's compute.
Note
There is a vCore quota per Azure subscription per region.  The default quota
should be more than enough to experiment with Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.  If you
need more vCores for a region in your subscription, see how toadjust
compute quotas.
Increase storage on nodes
You can increase the disk space of existing
nodes. Increasing disk space can allow you to do more with existing worker
nodes before needing to add more worker nodes.
To change the storage amount for all worker nodes, on theScalescreen, select a new value underStorage per node. To adjust the coordinator node's storage, expandCoordinatorand select a new value underCoordinator storage.
Note
Once you increase storage and save, you can't decrease the amount of storage.
Choose preferred availability zone
You can choose preferredavailability zonefor nodes if your cluster is in an Azure region that supports availability zones. If you select preferred availability zone during cluster provisioning, Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL provisions all cluster nodes into selected availability zone. If you select or change preferred availability zone after provisioning, all cluster nodes are moved to the new preferred availability zone during nextscheduled maintenance.
To select preferred availability zone for all cluster nodes, on theScalescreen, specify a zone inPreferred availability zonelist. To let Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL service select an availability zone for cluster, choose 'No preference'.
