AnAnalytics viewprovides a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data. Analytics views support Azure Boards data. Each view corresponds to a flat-list of work items. Work item hierarchies aren't supported.
Important
Analytics views only support Azure Boards data (work items). Analytics views don't support other data types, such as pipelines. Views provide a flat list of work items and don't support work item hierarchies. At this point, there are no plans to update the connector to support other types of data. For information on other approaches, seeAbout Power BI integration.
You can use a default Analytics view orcreate a custom view. Create custom views in the web portal for Azure DevOps. After you define a view that supports the data of interest, you can then open the view usingPower BI Data Connectorto create a report.
Prerequisites
Users with Stakeholder access don't have access to view or edit Analytics views.
Note
IfBoardsis disabled, thenAnalytics viewsis also disabled. All widgets associated with work item tracking are also disabled in the widget catalog. To re-enable a service, seeTurn on or off an Azure DevOps service.
Default Analytics views
Azure DevOps provides default Analytics views. The default views are immediately accessible from Power BI. The view you select determines the set of records, fields, and history to pull into Power BI.
The following screenshot shows the default views created for a project based on the Agile process. For more information, seeManage Analytics views.


Note
The labels for the default Analytics views differ depending on the process that was chosen for your team project:Basic,Agile,Scrum, orCMMI. The functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.
When you use the Power BI Data Connector, these same default views appear in the Navigator dialog. The view you select determines the set of records, fields, and history that is loaded into Power BI.

Options for work item types and historical data
Default Analytics views work well for customers with small datasets. Each default Analytics view provides a combination of options for work item types and historical data. The following tables describe each set of options.
When a default view doesn't meet your needs
The default Analytics views return all the specified data in a project. They work well for customers with smaller datasets. For larger datasets, the amount of data generated by a default view might be too large for Power BI to load.
In these cases, you cancreate a custom Analytics viewto fine-tune the records, fields, and history loaded into Power BI.
Custom Analytics views
If the default Analytics views don't meet your needs, you can create custom views to fine-tune the records, fields, and history returned to Power BI. With a custom view, you can  define the following options:
Sharing options
Work item filters
Team and area path filters
Backlog and work item type filters
Field-specific filters
Fields to display
View history and trend options
For more information, seeCreate an Analytics view.
Common reportable fields
Default views automatically include the most common fields for the included work item types used for reporting. All custom fields are included.
For example, the following fields are included when filtered for bugs and work items. You can look up the description of most of these fields from theEntities and properties reference for Azure BoardsorWork item field index.
Area Path
Assigned To
Date
Is Current
Iteration Path
State
Title
Work Item ID
Work Item Type
Two fields that are reported on are only available from Analytics data:Cycle Time DaysandLead Time Days. For more information about how these days are calculated, seeLead time versus cycle time.
For more information on how the dataset is modeled when you use the Power BI Data Connector, seeAnalytics views dataset design.
