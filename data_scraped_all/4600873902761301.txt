Returns the approximatedatetimein UTC format indicating when the current record was ingested.
This function must be used in the context of a table or amaterialized view. Otherwise, this function produces null values.
IfIngestionTime policywas not enabled when the data was ingested, the function returns null values.
Retrieves thedatetimewhen the record was ingested and ready for query.
datetime
Note
The value returned by this function is only approximate, as the ingestion process may take several minutes to complete and multiple ingestion activities may take place concurrently. To process all records of a table with exactly-once guarantees, usedatabase cursors.
Tip
The ingestion_time() function returns values according to the service clock as measured when ingestion was completed. As a result, this value cannot be used to "order" ingestion operations, as two operations that overlap in time might have any ordering of these values. If ordering records is important for application semantics, one should ensure that the table has a timestamp column as measured by the source of the data instead of relying on the ingestion_time() value.
