For more information, seeInstall and configure Azure DevOps ServerandRequirements and compatibility.
Hardware recommendations
Search works on any physical server or virtual machine that runs Azure DevOps Server. You can set it up on the same server or a different one for Search. If you use the same server, consider the CPU usage.
Tip
We recommend that you configure Search on a separate server for production environments.
For acceptable performance in multi-user scenarios, consider the following recommendations:
Fewer than 250 users with Search located on the server (typically used for demonstration and trial purposes):Quad core processor, 16 GB (minimum) RAMCPU Utilization factor less than 50%Fast hard drive backed by Solid State Drive (SSD) storage
Quad core processor, 16 GB (minimum) RAM
CPU Utilization factor less than 50%

Disk space requirement:
The amount of disk space used by Search depends mainly on the type and size of files indexed. For Code search, since many times repositories can be large and have different code files in version control, disk space requirement could be significant.Allocate up to 150% of the size of all the repositories to be indexed.From TFS 2018 Update 3 and onward, users can exclude folders from their repositories for index to optimize the disk space consumed by search.
Software dependencies
Search has the following dependencies, which get installed automatically as part of the configuration:
Elasticsearchby Elastic.Search uses a modified version of Elasticsearch. It works only with this modified version.A newer version of Elasticsearch ships with TFS 2018 Update 2 and onward, and Azure DevOps Server. All content is reindexed after installation when you upgrade from an older version of Search results. Depending on the volume of content (code files, work items, and wiki pages), reindexing can take some time to complete.

Note
The system or server administrator must ensure that Server JRE is maintained and updated in line with the software provider's recommendations. Also see theJava installation notesthat follow.
Regularlycheck for updates.
If the Search configuration wizard doesn't detect a working installation of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), it provides an option to download and install the latest supported version. Internet connectivity is required to download. If the target server doesn't have Internet connectivity, you must download and install a JRE manually before attempting to install Search.

During installation, the wizard sets theJAVA_HOMEenvironment variable to point to the JRE installation folder. The configuration wizard might not detect an existing JRE installation if it wasn't correctly configured, or if theJAVA_HOMEsetting points to an earlier version than required by Search.NoteWe don't advise installing Elasticsearch on a machine where resources are shared, especially on a large enterprise environment with multiple application tiers. We recommend that you set up Elasticsearch in a separate dedicated machine. In that way, the JAVA environment isn't shared across machines for other purposes.

If you can't install the version of Java required by Search because of other dependencies, you can do the following tasks:Install Azure DevOps Server with the Search extension on a server that doesn't have Java installed. We don't recommend this action for more than 250 users or CPU utilization greater than 50% or multiple ATs.Install Search and the JRE on aseparate serverfrom Azure DevOps Server.NoteIf you're using Oracle Server JRE 8, which was the default for Search in TFS (Azure DevOps Server doesn't use Oracle Server JRE 8), be aware of the following information:Search doesn't use or support any of the commercial features of Server JRE 8. Therefore, during Search configuration, the commercial features of the Server JRE are neither activated nor unlocked.If you choose to continue with Oracle JRE, contact Oracle for aJava SE Subscription, so that you can continue to receive JRE updates.

Feature availability
Work Item Search is available in Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2018 and later versions.
Wiki Search is available in TFS 2018 Update 2 and later versions.
Work Item and Wiki search are built-in extensions that are installed by default during Search configuration.
Code Search is available in TFS 2018 and later versions, and is an opt-in feature. You can install Code Search later from the Local Gallery. Go toLocal Gallery(http://{server}/_gallery) as an administrator. Non-administrative users can also request the extension for Azure DevOps Server. For more information, seeInstall an extension.
http://{server}/_gallery
Configure Search
Configure the Search service using the dedicated pages in the Server Configuration Wizard as you install Azure DevOps Server. You can alsounconfigure Searchafterwards by running the Server Configuration Wizard again or by launching the Search Configuration Wizard.
Configuration considerations
Consider the following information when you configure Search:
Both Work Item and Wiki search get enabled by default when Search is configured. These extensions can be later removed if necessary from theManage Extensionspage of Azure DevOps Server.
The Code Search extension must be installed for each Azure DevOps Server collection where you want to use it. When you initially configure Search, you can set a checkbox toAutomatically install Code Search extension for existing and new Project Collectionsto automate this process.
If you don't set the checkbox to install the Code Search extension for all your project collections, your PCA can install it from the Local Gallery. Ensure you go to the Local Gallery (http://{Server}/_gallery) from your Azure DevOps Server portal page. For more information, seeInstall an extension.
http://{Server}/_gallery
It typically takes less than one hour for Search to index a collection. But, it may take up to 12 hours based on the size and number of code files, work items, or wiki pages. If you get no results after this period,check the indexing status.
For maximum performance, the search index folder should be on a separate fast hard drive and backed by fast storage, such as a solid-state drive (SSD) or Storage Area Network (SAN).Allocate up to 150%of the size of all the repositories to be indexed, which is the worst-case scenario. The actual consumed space depends on the amount and type of code files, and the number of work items and wiki pages in that collection.Unless specified, the indexing service and Elasticsearch engine use the network service account during installation to create and access the index files. If you choose a different account, it must haveLog on as a servicepermission.Restrict the permissions for the index disk and folder to protect the index from accidental or malicious modification or deletion. Configure appropriatesecurity settingsfor the service.

Restrict the permissions for the index disk and folder to protect the index from accidental or malicious modification or deletion. Configure appropriatesecurity settingsfor the service.
When you configure Search for a server withmultiple ATs, install on aseparate server. After you install Search on the remote server, use the Configuration Wizard on any one of the AT servers to link the remote Search instance with your Azure DevOps Server instance. When you unconfigure Search, you must use the Configuration Wizard on the same AT server where configuration was originally carried out.
If you're doing apre-production upgradeon a server where Search was already configured, you must fully reconfigure Search again to avoid corrupting your production instance. There isn't an option to configure Search as part of a preproduction upgrade. Instead, configure it after the preproduction upgrade is complete. You can uncheckAutomatically install and configure Code Search for all existing and new collectionsduring configuration. Instead, install the Search extension for just one or two of your collections after configuration is complete
If you're doing aproduction upgradeon a server where Search is configured and you want to keep it, check the box next toInstall and Configure Search. The wizard detects your existing Search instance and automatically selectsUse existing Search instance, and prepopulates your current Search service URL. Use theInstall a new Search instanceoption only if you want to set up a new instance of Search on the same server. Setting up a new instance causes all your code, work items, and wiki to be indexed again, which - depending on the size of the collections - can take some time. During indexing, users might see partial search results
If you'reupgrading your server to new hardware, you have the following two options. Select from these options, depending on how Search was previously configured:If Search is on a separate server from Azure DevOps Server, you must selectInstall and Configure Searchin the Server Configuration Wizard, and then selectUse an existing Search instanceand provide the URL of your existing Search instance to complete the Search configurationIf Search is configured alongside your Azure DevOps Server instance on the old server, you must selectInstall and Configure Searchin the Server Configuration Wizard. Then, selectInstall a new Search instanceagain on the new server if you want to continue to cohost Search and Azure DevOps Server. All Search indexes for all collections are re-created which, depending on the size of each collection, might take some time

Install the Search extension, for the collection from theLocal Gallery, by browsing to it from your target Azure DevOps Server instance
Install or update Search on a separate server
To install or update Search on a separate or remote server, typically when there are more than 250 users, do the following steps:
As you install Azure DevOps Server on the primary server, set theInstall and configure Searchcheckbox.
in theSearchpage of the Server Configuration Wizard.
Select the option toUse an existing Search service.
Use theSearch service packagelink provided in the wizard to access a set of Search installer files on the local machine. Then, copy these files to the remote server.
Follow the instructions in theReadme.txtfile, located in the set of
installer files, to install or update the Search service on the remote server.
After installation completes, copy the resulting Search server URL into theSearch URLfield of the configuration wizard that runs on the Azure DevOps Server instance.
When both installations are complete, configure appropriatesecurity settingsfor both servers.
Secure search
The Search service uses a modified version ofElasticsearch. The terms "Search" and "Elasticsearch" are used interchangeably for the rest of this section. Administrators must provide credentials whether the Search service is on the same machine as Azure DevOps Server, or on a separate machine. This action is part of configuring the Search feature through the server or the Search configuration wizard. These credentials are new and aren't related to any preexisting account or server credentials. They're used to set up and connect to Search service. These new sets of credentials enable basic authentication in the search service.

For an upgrade from TFS 2018 Update 1.1 to TFS 2018 Update 3 or for search reconfiguration, only the user information automatically populates and administrators must provide credentials. Administrators can provide different credentials if they wish. If the Search service is on the same machine as Azure DevOps Server, administrators can provide a new set of credentials in the Configuration Wizard to set up the Search service, if wanted. However, if the Search service is on a remote machine, administrators must first provide the new credentials to the Search service setup script.
Note
Credential values should both be between 8 and 64 characters in length.
Search credentials only authenticate the users and make sure that unauthenticated users can't access the Elasticsearch endpoint. However, Elasticsearch doesn't support HTTPS and so these credentials get sent over the network as Base64 encoded strings. If there's a possibility of intermediate access to request, configure appropriate security settings based on your corporate security and compliance requirements.
Aim to limit access to both searching and indexing to specific users or user groups using encryption through IPSec, described as follows.
Consider the following techniques for using IPSec to secure Elasticsearch on a Windows server:
Configure security with authentication only:Ensures only authorized users can access the Elasticsearch port. It requires only service-side rules (firewall rules on only the server running Elasticsearch)Prerequisite: Azure DevOps Server must be configured with a domain accountFollow the steps inCreating Firewall Rules that Allow IPsec-protected Network Traffic

Uninstall Search
For a preproduction upgrade, production upgrade, new hardware migration, cloning, or other maintenance operation, the Server Configuration Wizard unconfigures Search. But, it's easy to reconfigure after the server maintenance operation is complete.
There might be cases where you no longer want to use Search or you want to do a new and clean install. This operation requires multiple steps, depending on whether Search is configured on thesame serveras Azure DevOps Server, or on aseparate server.
