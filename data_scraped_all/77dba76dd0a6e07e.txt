To connect your Azure virtual network (VNet) and your on-premises network by using Azure ExpressRoute, you must first create a virtual network gateway. A virtual network gateway serves two purposes: to exchange IP routes between networks, and to route network traffic.
This article explains different gateway types, gateway SKUs, and estimated performance by SKU. This article also explains ExpressRouteFastPath, a feature that enables the network traffic from your on-premises network to bypass the virtual network gateway to improve performance.
Gateway types
When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify several settings. One of the required settings,-GatewayType, specifies whether the gateway is used for ExpressRoute or VPN traffic. The two gateway types are:
-GatewayType
Vpn: To send encrypted traffic across the public internet, useVpnfor-GatewayType(also called a VPN gateway). Site-to-site, point-to-site, and VNet-to-VNet connections all use a VPN gateway.

Each virtual network can have only one virtual network gateway per gateway type. For example, you can have one virtual network gateway that usesVpnfor-GatewayType, and one that usesExpressRoutefor-GatewayType.

Gateway SKUs
When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. When you select a higher gateway SKU, more CPUs and network bandwidth are allocated to the gateway. As a result, the gateway can support higher network throughput to the virtual network.
ExpressRoute virtual network gateways can use the following SKUs:
ERGwScale (preview)
Standard
HighPerformance
UltraPerformance
ErGw1Az
ErGw2Az
ErGw3Az
If you want to upgrade your gateway to a higher-capacity gateway SKU, you can use theGateway Migration toolin either the Azure portal or PowerShell. The following upgrades are supported:
Non-Az-enabled SKU on Basic IP to Non-Az-enabled SKU on Standard IP
Non-Az-enabled SKU on Basic IP to Az-enabled SKU on Standard IP
For more information, seeMigrate to an availability zone-enabled gateway.
For all other downgrade scenarios, you need to delete and re-create the gateway, which incurs downtime.
Gateway subnet creation
Before you create an ExpressRoute gateway, you must create a gateway subnet. The virtual network gateway virtual machines (VMs) and services use IP addresses that are contained in the gateway subnet.
When you create your virtual network gateway, gateway VMs are deployed to the gateway subnet and configured with the required ExpressRoute gateway settings. Never deploy anything else into the gateway subnet. The gateway subnet must be named "GatewaySubnet" to work properly, because doing so lets Azure know to deploy the virtual network gateway VMs and services into this subnet.
Note
User-defined routes with a 0.0.0.0/0 destination and network security groups (NSGs) on the gateway subnetare not supported. Gateways with this configuration are blocked from being created. Gateways require access to the management controllers in order to function properly.Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagationshould be enabled on the gateway subnet to ensure availability of the gateway. If BGP route propagation is disabled, the gateway won't function.

Diagnostics, data path, and control path can be affected if a user-defined route overlaps with the gateway subnet range or the gateway public IP range.

We don't recommend deploying Azure DNS Private Resolver into a virtual network that has an ExpressRoute virtual network gateway and setting wildcard rules to direct all name resolution to a specific DNS server. Such a configuration can cause management connectivity problems.
When you create the gateway subnet, you specify the number of IP addresses that the subnet contains. The IP addresses in the gateway subnet are allocated to the gateway VMs and gateway services. Some configurations require more IP addresses than others.
When you're planning your gateway subnet size, refer to the documentation for the configuration that you're planning to create. For example, the ExpressRoute/VPN gateway coexistence configuration requires a larger gateway subnet than most other configurations. Furthermore, you might want to make sure your gateway subnet contains enough IP addresses to accommodate possible future configurations.
We recommend that you create a gateway subnet of /27 or larger. If you plan to connect 16 ExpressRoute circuits to your gateway, youmustcreate a gateway subnet of /26 or larger. If you're creating a dual stack gateway subnet, we recommend that you also use an IPv6 range of /64 or larger. This setup accommodates most configurations.
The following Azure Resource Manager PowerShell example shows a gateway subnet named GatewaySubnet. You can see that the Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) notation specifies a /27, which allows for enough IP addresses for most configurations that currently exist.
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.0.3.0/27
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.0.3.0/27
Important
NSGs on the gateway subnet aren't supported. Associating a network security group to this subnet might cause your virtual network gateway (VPN and ExpressRoute gateways) to stop functioning as expected. For more information about network security groups, seeWhat is a network security group?.
Virtual network gateway limitations and performance
Feature support by gateway SKU
The following table shows the features that each gateway type supports and the maximum number of ExpressRoute circuit connections that each gateway SKU supports.
Note
The maximum number of ExpressRoute circuits from the same peering location that can connect to the same virtual network is 4 for all gateways.
Estimated performances by gateway SKU
The following tables provide an overview of the different types of gateways, their respective limitations, and their expected performance metrics.
This table applies to both the Azure Resource Manager and classic deployment models.
1The values in the table are estimates and vary depending on the CPU utilization of the gateway. If the CPU utilization is high and the number of supported VMs is exceeded, the gateway will start to drop packets.
Note
ExpressRoute can facilitate up to 11,000 routes that span virtual network address spaces, on-premises networks, and any relevant virtual network peering connections. To ensure stability of your ExpressRoute connection, refrain from advertising more than 11,000 routes to ExpressRoute. The maximum number of routes advertised by gateway is 1,000 routes.
Important
Application performance depends on multiple factors, such as end-to-end latency and the number of traffic flows that the application opens. The numbers in the table represent the upper limit that the application can theoretically achieve in an ideal environment. Additionally, we perform routine host and OS maintenance on the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway, to maintain reliability of the service. During a maintenance period, the control plane and data path capacity of the gateway is reduced.
During a maintenance period, you might experience intermittent connectivity problems to private endpoint resources.
ExpressRoute supports a maximum TCP and UDP packet size of 1,400 bytes. Packet sizes larger than 1,400 bytes will get fragmented.
Azure Route Server can support up to 4,000 VMs. This limit includes VMs in virtual networks that are peered. For more information, seeAzure Route Server limitations.
The values in the table above represent the limits at each Gateway SKU.
Zone-redundant gateway SKUs
You can also deploy ExpressRoute gateways in Azure availability zones. Physically and logically separating the gateways into availability zones helps protect your on-premises network connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures.

Zone-redundant gateways use specific new gateway SKUs for ExpressRoute gateways:
ErGw1AZ
ErGw2AZ
ErGw3AZ
ErGwScale (preview)
ExpressRoute scalable gateway (preview)
The ErGwScale virtual network gateway SKU enables you to achieve 40-Gbps connectivity to VMs and private endpoints in the virtual network.This SKU allows you to set a minimum and maximum scale unit for the virtual network gateway infrastructure, which autoscales based on the active bandwidth or flow count. You can also set a fixed scale unit to maintain a constant connectivity at a desired bandwidth value. ErGwScale will be zone-redundant by default in Azure Regions that support availability zones.
ErGwScale is available in preview in the following regions:
Australia East
Brazil South
Canada Central
East US
East Asia
France Central
Germany West Central
India Central
Italy North
North Europe
Norway East
Sweden Central
UAE North
UK South
West US 2
West US 3
Autoscaling vs. fixed scale unit
The virtual network gateway infrastructure autoscales between the minimum and maximum scale unit that you configure, based on the bandwidth or flow count utilization. Scale operations might take up to 30 minutes to complete. If you want to achieve a fixed connectivity at a specific bandwidth value, you can configure a fixed scale unit by setting the minimum scale unit and the maximum scale unit to the same value.
Limitations
Basic IP: ErGwScale doesn't support the Basic IP SKU. You need to use a Standard IP SKU to configure ErGwScale.
Minimum and maximum scale units: You can configure the scale unit for ErGwScale between 1 and 40. Theminimum scale unitcan't be lower than 1 and themaximum scale unitcan't be higher than 40.
Migration scenarios: You can't migrate from Standard/ErGw1Az or HighPerf/ErGw2Az/UltraPerf/ErGw3Az to ErGwScale in the preview.
Pricing
ErGwScale is free of charge during the preview. For information about ExpressRoute pricing, seeAzure ExpressRoute pricing.
Supported performance per scale unit
Sample performance with scale unit
1Maximum VM connections scale differently beyond 10 scale units. The first 10 scale units provide capacity for 2,000 VMs per scale unit. Scale units 11 and above provide 1,000 more VM capacity per scale unit.
Connectivity from VNet to VNet and from VNet to virtual WAN
By default, VNet-to-VNet and VNet-to-virtual-WAN connectivity is disabled through an ExpressRoute circuit for all gateway SKUs. To enable this connectivity, you must configure the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway to allow this traffic. For more information, see guidance aboutvirtual network connectivity over ExpressRoute. To enable this traffic, seeEnable VNet-to-VNet or VNet-to-virtual-WAN connectivity through ExpressRoute.
FastPath
The ExpressRoute virtual network gateway is designed to exchange network routes and route network traffic. FastPath is designed to improve the data path performance between your on-premises network and your virtual network. When FastPath is enabled, it sends network traffic directly to virtual machines in the virtual network, bypassing the gateway.
For more information about FastPath, including limitations and requirements, seeAbout FastPath.
Connectivity to private endpoints
The ExpressRoute virtual network gateway facilitates connectivity to private endpoints deployed in the same virtual network as the virtual network gateway and across virtual network peers.
Important
The throughput and control plane capacity for connectivity to private endpoint resources might be reduced by half compared to connectivity to non-private endpoint resources.
During a maintenance period, you might experience intermittent connectivity problems to private endpoint resources.
You need to ensure that on-premises configuration, including router and firewall settings, are correctly set up to ensure that packets for the IP 5-tuple transits use a single next hop (Microsoft Enterprise Edge router) unless there's a maintenance event. If your on-premises firewall or router configuration is causing the same IP 5-tuple to frequently switch next hops, you'll experience connectivity problems.
Private endpoint connectivity and planned maintenance events
Private endpoint connectivity is stateful. When a connection to a private endpoint is established over ExpressRoute private peering, inbound and outbound connections are routed through one of the back-end instances of the gateway infrastructure. During a maintenance event, back-end instances of the virtual network gateway infrastructure are rebooted one at a time, which could lead to intermittent connectivity problems.
To avoid or minimize connectivity problems with private endpoints during maintenance activities, we recommend setting the TCP time-out value to fall between 15 and 30 seconds on your on-premises applications. Test and configure the optimal value based on your application requirements.
REST APIs and PowerShell cmdlets
See the following pages for more technical resources and specific syntax requirements when you're using REST APIs and PowerShell cmdlets for virtual network gateway configurations:
VNet-to-VNet connectivity
By default, connectivity between virtual networks is enabled when you link multiple virtual networks to the same ExpressRoute circuit. We don't recommend using your ExpressRoute circuit for communication between virtual networks. Instead, we recommend that you usevirtual network peering. For more information about why VNet-to-VNet connectivity isn't recommended over ExpressRoute, seeConnectivity between virtual networks over ExpressRoute.
Virtual network peering
A virtual network with an ExpressRoute gateway can have virtual network peering with up to 500 other virtual networks. Virtual network peering without an ExpressRoute gateway might have a higher peering limitation.
