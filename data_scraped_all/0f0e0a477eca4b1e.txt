IP addresses in Azure fall into two categories: dynamic and reserved. Public IP addresses managed by Azure are dynamic by default. That means that the IP address used for a given cloud service (VIP) or to access a VM or role instance directly (ILPIP) can change from time to time, when resources are shut down or stopped (deallocated).
To prevent IP addresses from changing, you can reserve an IP address. Reserved IPs can be used only as a VIP, ensuring that the IP address for the cloud service remains the same, even as resources are shut down or stopped (deallocated). Furthermore, you can convert existing dynamic IPs used as a VIP to a reserved IP address.
Important
Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:Resource Manager and classic. This article covers using the classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. Learn how to reserve a static public IP address using theResource Manager deployment model.
To learn more about IP addresses in Azure, read theIP addressesarticle.
When do I need a reserved IP?
You want to ensure that the IP is reserved in your subscription. If you want to reserve an IP address that is not released from your subscription under any circumstance, you should use a reserved public IP.
You want your IP to stay with your cloud service even across stopped or deallocated state (VMs). If you want your service to be accessed by using an IP address that doesn't change, even when VMs in the cloud service are shut down or stop (deallocated).
You want to ensure that outbound traffic from Azure uses a predictable IP address. You may have your on-premises firewall configured to allow only traffic from specific IP addresses. By reserving an IP, you know the source IP address, and don't need to update your firewall rules due to an IP change.
FAQs
Can I use a reserved IP for all Azure services?
No. Reserved IPs can only be used for VMs and cloud service instance roles exposed through a VIP.
How many reserved IPs can I have?
For details, see theAzure limitsarticle.
Is there a charge for reserved IPs?
Sometimes. For pricing details, see theReserved IP Address Pricing Detailspage.
How do I reserve an IP address?
You can use PowerShell, theAzure Management REST API, or theAzure portalto reserve an IP address in an Azure region. A reserved IP address is associated to your subscription.
Can I use a reserved IP with affinity group-based VNets?
No. Reserved IPs are only supported in regional VNets. Reserved IPs are not supported for VNets that are associated with affinity groups. For more information about associating a VNet with a region or affinity group, see theAbout Regional VNets and Affinity Groupsarticle.
Manage reserved VIPs
Using Azure PowerShell (classic)
Before you can use reserved IPs, you must add it to your subscription. Create a reserved IP from the pool of public IP addresses available in theCentral USlocation as follows:
Note
For classic deployment model, you must install the Service Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, seeInstall the Azure PowerShell Service Management module.
New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US"
New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US"
Notice, however, that you cannot specify what IP is being reserved. To view what IP addresses are reserved in your subscription, run the following PowerShell command, and notice the values forReservedIPNameandAddress:
Get-AzureReservedIP
Get-AzureReservedIP
Expected output:
ReservedIPName       : MyReservedIP
Address              : 23.101.114.211

Note
When you create a reserved IP address with PowerShell, you cannot specify a resource group to create the reserved IP in. Azure places it into a resource group namedDefault-Networkingautomatically. If you create the reserved IP using theAzure portal, you can specify any resource group you choose. If you create the reserved IP in a resource group other thanDefault-Networkinghowever, whenever you reference the reserved IP with commands such asGet-AzureReservedIPandRemove-AzureReservedIP, you must reference the nameGroup resource-group-name reserved-ip-name.  For example, if you create a reserved IP namedmyReservedIPin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup, you must reference the name of the reserved IP asGroup myResourceGroup myReservedIP.
Get-AzureReservedIP
Remove-AzureReservedIP
Once an IP is reserved, it remains associated to your subscription until you delete it. Delete a reserved IP as follows:
Remove-AzureReservedIP -ReservedIPName "MyReservedIP"
Remove-AzureReservedIP -ReservedIPName "MyReservedIP"
Using Azure CLI (classic)
Create a reserved IP from the pool of public IP addresses available in theCentral USlocation as Using Azure classic CLI follows:
Note
For classic deployment, you must use Azure classic CLI. For information about installing Azure classic CLI, seeInstall the Azure classic CLI
Command:
azure network reserved-ip create <name> <location>
azure network reserved-ip create <name> <location>
Example:
azure network reserved-ip create MyReservedIP centralus
azure network reserved-ip create MyReservedIP centralus
You can view what IP addresses are reserved in your subscription using Azure CLI as follows:
Command:
azure network reserved-ip list
azure network reserved-ip list
Once an IP is reserved, it remains associated to your subscription until you delete it. Delete a reserved IP as follows:
Command:
azure network reserved-ip delete <name>
azure network reserved-ip delete <name>
Example:
azure network reserved-ip delete MyReservedIP
azure network reserved-ip delete MyReservedIP
Reserve the IP address of an existing cloud service
You can reserve the IP address of an existing cloud service by adding the-ServiceNameparameter. Reserve the IP address of a cloud serviceTestServicein theCentral USlocation as follows:
-ServiceName
Using Azure PowerShell (classic):New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US" -ServiceName TestService
Using Azure PowerShell (classic):
New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US" -ServiceName TestService
New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US" -ServiceName TestService
Using Azure CLI (classic):Command:azure network reserved-ip create <name> <location> -r <service-name> -d <deployment-name>Example:azure network reserved-ip create MyReservedIP centralus -r TestService -d asmtest8942
Using Azure CLI (classic):
Command:
azure network reserved-ip create <name> <location> -r <service-name> -d <deployment-name>
azure network reserved-ip create <name> <location> -r <service-name> -d <deployment-name>
Example:
azure network reserved-ip create MyReservedIP centralus -r TestService -d asmtest8942
azure network reserved-ip create MyReservedIP centralus -r TestService -d asmtest8942
Associate a reserved IP to a new cloud service
The following script creates a new reserved IP, then associates it to a new cloud service namedTestService.
Using Azure PowerShell (classic)
New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US"

$image = Get-AzureVMImage|?{$_.ImageName -like "*RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64*"}

New-AzureVMConfig -Name TestVM -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $image.ImageName `
| Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -AdminUsername adminuser -Password MyP@ssw0rd!! `
| New-AzureVM -ServiceName TestService -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -Location "Central US"
New-AzureReservedIP âReservedIPName MyReservedIP âLocation "Central US"

$image = Get-AzureVMImage|?{$_.ImageName -like "*RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64*"}

New-AzureVMConfig -Name TestVM -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $image.ImageName `
| Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -AdminUsername adminuser -Password MyP@ssw0rd!! `
| New-AzureVM -ServiceName TestService -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -Location "Central US"
Note
When you create a reserved IP to use with a cloud service, you still refer to the VM by usingVIP:<port number>for inbound communication. Reserving an IP does not mean you can connect to the VM directly. The reserved IP is assigned to the cloud service that the VM has been deployed to. If you want to connect to a VM by IP directly, you have to configure an instance-level public IP. An instance-level public IP is a type of public IP (called an ILPIP) that is assigned directly to your VM. It cannot be reserved. For more information, read theInstance-level Public IP (ILPIP)article.
Remove a reserved IP from a running deployment
Remove a reserved IP added to a new cloud service as follows:
Using Azure PowerShell (classic)
Remove-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -ServiceName TestService
Remove-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -ServiceName TestService
Using Azure CLI (classic)
Command:
azure network reserved-ip disassociate <name> <service-name> <deployment-name>
azure network reserved-ip disassociate <name> <service-name> <deployment-name>
Example:
azure network reserved-ip disassociate MyReservedIP TestService asmtest8942
azure network reserved-ip disassociate MyReservedIP TestService asmtest8942
Note
Removing a reserved IP from a running deployment does not remove the reservation from your subscription. It simply frees the IP to be used by another resource in your subscription.
To remove a reserved IP completely from a subscription, run the following command:
Command:
azure network reserved-ip delete <name>
azure network reserved-ip delete <name>
Example:
azure network reserved-ip delete MyReservedIP
azure network reserved-ip delete MyReservedIP
Associate a reserved IP to a running deployment
Using Azure PowerShell (classic)
The following commands create a cloud service namedTestService2with a new VM namedTestVM2. The existing reserved IP namedMyReservedIPis then associated to the cloud service.
$image = Get-AzureVMImage|?{$_.ImageName -like "*RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64*"}

New-AzureVMConfig -Name TestVM2 -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $image.ImageName `
| Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -AdminUsername adminuser -Password MyP@ssw0rd!! `
| New-AzureVM -ServiceName TestService2 -Location "Central US"

Set-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -ServiceName TestService2
$image = Get-AzureVMImage|?{$_.ImageName -like "*RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64*"}

New-AzureVMConfig -Name TestVM2 -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $image.ImageName `
| Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -AdminUsername adminuser -Password MyP@ssw0rd!! `
| New-AzureVM -ServiceName TestService2 -Location "Central US"

Set-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName MyReservedIP -ServiceName TestService2
Using Azure CLI (classic)
You can associate a new reserved IP to your running cloud service deployment using Azure CLI as follows:
Command:
azure network reserved-ip associate <name> <service-name> <deployment-name>
azure network reserved-ip associate <name> <service-name> <deployment-name>
Example:
azure network reserved-ip associate MyReservedIP TestService asmtest8942
azure network reserved-ip associate MyReservedIP TestService asmtest8942
Associate a reserved ip to a cloud service by using a service configuration file
You can also associate a reserved IP to a cloud service by using a service configuration (CSCFG) file. The following sample xml shows how to configure a cloud service to use a reserved VIP namedMyReservedIP:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <ServiceConfiguration serviceName="ReservedIPSample" xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceConfiguration" osFamily="4" osVersion="*" schemaVersion="2014-01.2.3">
      <Role name="WebRole1">
        <Instances count="1" />
        <ConfigurationSettings>
          <Setting name="Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString" value="UseDevelopmentStorage=true" />
        </ConfigurationSettings>
      </Role>
      <NetworkConfiguration>
        <AddressAssignments>
          <ReservedIPs>
