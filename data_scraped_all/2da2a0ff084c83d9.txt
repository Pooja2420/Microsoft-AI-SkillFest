The Microsoft 365 (formerly, Office 365) activity log connector provides insight into ongoing user activities. You'll get details of operations such as file downloads, access requests sent, changes to group events, set-mailbox, and details of the user who performed the actions. By connecting Microsoft 365 logs into Microsoft Sentinel you can use this data to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve your investigation process. For more information, see theMicrosoft Sentinel documentation.
