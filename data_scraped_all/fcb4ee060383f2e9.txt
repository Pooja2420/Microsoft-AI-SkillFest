Data connector prerequisites
Each data connector has its own set of prerequisites. Prerequisites might include that you must have specific permissions on your Azure workspace, subscription, or policy. Or, you must meet other requirements for the partner data source you're connecting to.
Prerequisites for each data connector are listed on the relevant data connector page in Microsoft Sentinel.
Azure Monitor agent (AMA) based data connectors require an internet connection from the system where the agent is installed. Enable port 443 outbound to allow a connection between the system where the agent is installed and Microsoft Sentinel.
Syslog and Common Event Format (CEF) connectors
Log collection from many security appliances and devices are supported by the data connectorsSyslog via AMAorCommon Event Format (CEF) via AMAin Microsoft Sentinel. To forward data to your Log Analytics workspace for Microsoft Sentinel, complete the steps inIngest syslog and CEF messages to Microsoft Sentinel with the Azure Monitor Agent. These steps include installing the Microsoft Sentinel solution for a security appliance or device from theContent hubin Microsoft Sentinel. Then, configure theSyslog via AMAorCommon Event Format (CEF) via AMAdata connector that's appropriate for the Microsoft Sentinel solution you installed. Complete the setup by configuring the security device or appliance. Find instructions to configure your security device or appliance in one of the following articles:
CEF via AMA data connector - Configure specific appliance or device for Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion
Syslog via AMA data connector - Configure specific appliance or device for Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion
Contact the solution provider for more information or where information is unavailable for the appliance or device.
Custom Logs via AMA connector
Filter and ingest logs in text-file format from network or security applications installed on Windows or Linux machines by using theCustom Logs via AMA connectorin Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see the following articles:
Collect logs from text files with the Azure Monitor Agent and ingest to Microsoft Sentinel
Custom Logs via AMA data connector - Configure data ingestion to Microsoft Sentinel from specific applications
Codeless connector platform connectors
The following connectors use the current codeless connector platform but don't have a specific documentation page generated. They're available from the content hub in Microsoft Sentinel as part of a solution. For instructions on how to configure these data connectors, review the instructions available with each data connector within Microsoft Sentinel.
For more information about the codeless connector platform, seeCreate a codeless connector for Microsoft Sentinel.
