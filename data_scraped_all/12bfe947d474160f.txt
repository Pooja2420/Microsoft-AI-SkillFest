Build the second layer of defense with Microsoft Defender XDR Security services
Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
Many organizations operate in a hybrid environment, with resources hosted both on Azure and on-premises. Most Azure resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), Azure applications, and Microsoft Entra ID, can be secured using Azureâs built-in security services.
In addition, organizations frequently subscribe to Microsoft 365 to provide users with applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Exchange Online. Microsoft 365 also offers security services that can be used to add an extra layer of protection to some of the most widely used Azure resources.
To effectively utilize Microsoft 365 security services, it's important to understand key terminology and the structure of Microsoft 365 services. This fourth article in a series of five explores these topics in greater detail, building on concepts covered in previous articles, particularly:
Map threats to your IT environment
Build the first layer of defense with Azure Security services
Microsoft 365 and Office 365 are cloud-based services designed to address your organization's needs for strong security, reliability, and enhanced user productivity. Microsoft 365 encompasses services such as Power Automate, Forms, Stream, Sway, and Office 365. Office 365 specifically includes the familiar suite of productivity applications. For more information about subscription options for these two services, seeMicrosoft 365 and Office 365 plan options.
Depending on the license that you acquire for Microsoft 365, you can also get the security services for Microsoft 365. These security services are called Microsoft Defender XDR, which provides multiple services:
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI)
Microsoft Defender for Office (MDO)
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDA)
"Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps" accessed through "security.microsoft.com" is different from "Microsoft Defender for Cloud" that is another security solution accessed through "portal.azure.com".
The following diagram illustrates the relationship of solutions and main services that Microsoft 365 offers, though not all services are listed.

Potential use case
People often get confused about Microsoft 365 security services and their role in IT cybersecurity. A major cause of this confusion stems from the similarity in names, including some Azure security services like Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Security Center) and Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly Microsoft Cloud App Security).
However, the confusion goes beyond terminology. Some services provide similar protections but for different resources. For example, Defender for Identity and Azure Identity Protection both safeguard identity services, but Defender for Identity secures on-premises identities (via Active Directory Domain Services and Kerberos authentication), while Azure Identity Protection secures cloud identities (via Microsoft Entra ID and OAuth authentication).
These examples highlight the importance of understanding how Microsoft 365 security services differ from Azure security services. By gaining this understanding, you can more effectively plan your security strategy in the Microsoft cloud while maintaining a strong security posture for your IT environment. This article aims to help you achieve that.
The following diagram presents a real-world use case for Microsoft Defender XDR security services. It shows the resources that need protection, the services running in the environment, and some potential threats. Microsoft Defender XDR services are positioned in the middle, defending the organization's resources from those threats.

Architecture
Microsoft's Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution, known as Microsoft Defender XDR, integrates multiple security tools and services to provide unified protection, detection, and response across endpoints, identities, email, applications, and cloud environments. It combines advanced threat intelligence, automation, and AI-driven analytics to detect and respond to sophisticated cyber threats in real-time, enabling security teams to quickly mitigate risks and reduce the impact of attacks. By consolidating security data from various sources, Microsoft Defender XDR helps organizations achieve comprehensive, streamlined defense across their entire IT infrastructure.
The following diagram shows a layer, labeled asDEFENDER, that represents theMicrosoft Defender XDRsecurity services. Adding these services to your IT environment helps you to build better defense for your environment. The services in the Defender layer can work with Azure security services.
