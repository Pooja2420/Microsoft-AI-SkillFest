The DCesv6-series areAzure confidential VMsthat protect the confidentiality and integrity of code and data while it's being processed. Organizations can use these VMs to seamlessly bring confidential workloads to the cloud without any code changes to the application. These machines are powered by IntelÂ® 5th Generation XeonÂ® Scalable processors reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.0 GHz andIntelÂ® AMXfor AI acceleration.
With the support ofIntelÂ® Trust Domain Extensions (TDX), these VMs are hardened from the cloud virtualized environment by denying the hypervisor, other host management code, and administrators access to the VM memory and state. It helps to protect VMs against a broad range of sophisticatedhardware and software attacks.
These VMs have native support forconfidential disk encryptionmeaning organizations can encrypt their VM disks at boot with either a customer-managed key (CMK), or platform-managed key (PMK). This feature is fully integrated withAzure KeyVaultorAzure Managed HSMwith validation for FIPS 140-2 Level 3.
The DCesv6 offer a balance of memory to vCPU performance that is suitable most production workloads. With up to 128 vCPUs, 512 GiB of RAM, and support for remote disk storage. These VMs work well for many general computing workloads, e-commerce systems, web front ends, desktop virtualization solutions, sensitive databases, other enterprise applications and more.
Important
These virtual machines are in public preview and not recommended for production usage. Sign up at aka.ms/acc/v6preview for access.
These VMs are available in West Europe, East US, West US, and West US 3.

Introduction to Azure managed disks
Azure managed disk types
Share an Azure managed disk
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.
To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, seeVirtual machine and disk performance.
Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
