Azure Monitor Logs is a data store where personal data is likely to be found. This article explains where Azure Monitor Logs stores personal data and how to manage this data.
Note
For information about viewing or deleting personal data, seeGeneral Data Subject Requests for the GDPR,Azure Data Subject Requests for the GDPR, orWindows Data Subject Requests for the GDPR, depending on your specific area and needs. For more information about GDPR, see theGDPR section of the Microsoft Trust Centerand theGDPR section of the Service Trust portal.
Strategy for personal data handling
While it's up to you and your company to define a strategy for handling personal data, here are a few approaches, listed from most to least preferable from a technical point of view:
Filter out, obfuscate, anonymize, or adjust collected data to exclude it from being considered "personal" usingdata collection transformations. This isby farthe preferred approach, which saves you the need to create a costly and impactful data handling strategy.
Normalize the data to reduce negative affects on the data platform and performance. For example, instead of logging an explicit User ID, create a lookup to correlate the username and their details to an internal ID that can then be logged elsewhere. That way, if a user asks you to delete their personal information, you can delete only the row in the lookup table that corresponds to the user.
If you need to collect personal data:Use theDelete Data APIorPurge APIand theQuery APIto export and delete any personal data associated with a user.Usesummary rulesto remove or obfuscate personal data in a new table that can be shared more widely, and limit access to the table with the personal data bymanaging table-level read access.

Where to look for personal data in Azure Monitor Logs
Azure Monitor Logs prescribes a schema to your data, but allows you to override every field with custom values. You can also ingest custom schemas. Therefore, it's impossible to say exactly where personal data exists in your specific workspace. The following locations, however, are good starting points in your inventory.
Note
Some of the queries in this article usesearch *to query all tables in a workspace. In general, we highly recommend you avoid usingsearch *, which creates a highly inefficient query, whenever possible. Instead, query a specific table.

IP addresses: Log Analytics collects various IP information in multiple tables. For example, the following query shows all tables that collected IPv4 addresses in the last 24 hours:search * 
| where * matches regex @'\b((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(\.|$)){4}\b' //RegEx originally provided on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5284147/validating-ipv4-addresses-with-regexp
| summarize count() by $table

User IDs: You can find user usernames and user IDs in various solutions and tables. Look for a particular username or user ID across your entire dataset using the search command:search "<username or user ID>"Remember to look not only for human-readable usernames but also for GUIDs that can be traced back to a particular user.

Device IDs: Like user IDs, device IDs are sometimes considered personal data. Use the approach described for user IDs to identify tables that hold personal data.

Custom data: Azure Monitor Logs lets you collect custom data through custom logs, custom fields, theLogs Ingestion API, and as part of system event logs. Check all custom data for personal data.

Export, delete, or purge personal data
Westronglyrecommend you restructure your data collection policy to stop collecting, filter out, obfuscate or anonymize personal data, or otherwise modify such data until it's no longer considered personal usingdata collection transformations. In handling personal, data you incur costs in defining and automating a strategy, building an interface through which your customers interact with their data, and ongoing maintenance. It's also computationally costly for Log Analytics and Application Insights, and a large volume of concurrent Query, Delete Data, or Purge API calls can negatively affect all other interactions with Log Analytics functionality. However, if you have to collect personal data, follow the guidelines in this section.
Note
Deleting or purging data doesn't affect billing. To control data retention costs, configuredata retention settings.
View and export
Use theLog Analytics query APIto send for view and export data requests.
Note
You can't use the Log Analytics query API on tables that have theBasic and Auxiliary table plans. Instead, use theSearch API.
You need to implement the logic for converting the data to an appropriate format for delivery to your users.Azure Functionsis a great place to host such logic.
Delete
TheAzure Monitor Logs Delete Data APIlets you make asynchronous requests to remove data for a specific table in your Log Analytics workspace. Use the Delete Data operation sparingly to avoid potential risks, performance impact, and the potential to skew all-up aggregations, measurements, and other aspects of your Log Analytics data. See theStrategy for personal data handlingsection for alternative approaches to handling personal data.
If you need to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements, use thePurge API, which is less performant and only supports operations required for GDPR compliance.
Warning
Delete and purge operations are destructive and non-reversible! Use extreme caution in their execution.
Purge
Azure Monitor'sPurge APIlets you purge personal data, as required by GDPR. The Purge API is less performant than theDelete Data API. Azure Monitor recommends using the Delete Data API and only authorizes purge requests required for GDPR compliance.
To manage system resources, we limit purge requests to 50 requests an hour. Batch the execution of purge requests by sending a single command whose predicate includes all user identities that require purging. Use thein operatorto specify multiple identities. Run the query before executing the purge request to verify the expected results.
Important
While most purge operations complete much quicker,the formal SLA for the completion of purge operations is set at 30 daysdue to their heavy impact on the data platform. This SLA meets GDPR requirements. It's an automated process, so there's no way to expedite the operation.

TheGet Purge Status POST APIreturns an 'x-ms-status-location' header that includes a URL you can call to determine the status of your purge operation. For example:x-ms-status-location: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/[SubscriptionId]/resourceGroups/[ResourceGroupName]/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/[WorkspaceName]/operations/purge-[PurgeOperationId]?api-version=2015-03-20
