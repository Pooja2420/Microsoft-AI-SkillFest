In this article, you learn how to see the number of each network resource type that you've deployed in your subscription and what yoursubscription limitsare. The ability to view resource usage against limits is helpful to track current usage, and plan for future use. You can use theAzure Portal,PowerShell, or theAzure CLIto track usage.
Azure Portal
Log into the Azureportal.
At the top, left corner of the Azure portal, selectAll services.
EnterSubscriptionsin theFilterbox. WhenSubscriptionsappears in the search results, select it.
Select the name of the subscription you want to view usage information for.
UnderSETTINGS, selectUsage + quota.
You can select the following options:Resource types: You can select all resource types, or select the specific types of resources you want to view.Providers: You can select all resource providers, or selectCompute,Network, orStorage.Locations: You can select all Azure locations, or select specific locations.You can select to show all resources, or only the resources where at least one is deployed.The example in the following picture shows all of the network resources with at least one resource deployed in the East US:You can sort the columns by selecting the column heading. The limits shown are the limits for your subscription. If you need to increase a default limit, selectRequest Increase, then complete and submit the support request. All resources have a maximum limit listed in Azurelimits. If your current limit is already at the maximum number, the limit can't be increased.

PowerShell
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
You can run the commands that follow in theAzure Cloud Shell, or by running PowerShell from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. If you run PowerShell from your computer, you need the Azure PowerShell module, version 1.0.0 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Azon your computer, to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module. If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to runLogin-AzAccountto log in to Azure.
Get-Module -ListAvailable Az
Login-AzAccount
View your usage against limits withGet-AzNetworkUsage. The following example gets the usage for resources where at least one resource is deployed in the East US location:
Get-AzNetworkUsage `
  -Location eastus `
  | Where-Object {$_.CurrentValue -gt 0} `
  | Format-Table ResourceType, CurrentValue, Limit
Get-AzNetworkUsage `
  -Location eastus `
  | Where-Object {$_.CurrentValue -gt 0} `
  | Format-Table ResourceType, CurrentValue, Limit
You receive output formatted the same as the following example output:
ResourceType            CurrentValue Limit
------------            ------------ -----
Virtual Networks                   1    50
Network Security Groups            2   100
Public IP Addresses                1    60
Network Interfaces                 1 24000
Network Watchers                   1     1

Azure CLI
If you're using Azure CLI commands to complete tasks in this article, run the commands via either theAzure Cloud Shellor the Azure CLI installed locally. This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.32 or later. Runaz --versionto find the installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall the Azure CLI. If you're running the Azure CLI locally, you also need to runaz loginto log in to Azure.
az --version
az login
View your usage against limits withaz network list-usages. The following example gets the usage for resources in the East US location:
az network list-usages \
  --location eastus \
  --out table
az network list-usages \
  --location eastus \
  --out table
You receive output formatted the same as the following example output:
Name                    CurrentValue Limit
------------            ------------ -----
Virtual Networks                   1    50
