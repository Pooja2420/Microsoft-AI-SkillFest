IMDS (Azure Instance Metadata Service) provides information about currently running virtual machine instances. The service is a REST API that's available at a well-known, nonroutable IP address (169.254.169.254).
When you place virtual machine or virtual machine set instances behind an Azure Standard Load Balancer, you can use IMDS to retrieve metadata related to the load balancer and the instances.
The metadata includes the following information for the virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets:
The instance level Public or Private IP of the specific Virtual Machine instance
Inbound rule configurations of the load balancer of each private IP of the network interface.
Outbound rule configurations of the load balancer of each private IP of the network interface.
