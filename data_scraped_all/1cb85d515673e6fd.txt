Av1-series retirement

On August 31, 2024, we retire Basic and Standard A-series virtual machines (VMs). Before that date, migrate your workloads to Av2-series VMs, which provide more memory per vCPU and faster storage on solid-state drives (SSDs).
The remaining VMs with these specific sizes on your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These VMs will be stopped and removed from the host. These VMs will no longer be billed in the deallocated state.
Note
In some cases, you must deallocate the VM prior to resizing. This can happen if the new size is not available on the hardware cluster that is currently hosting the VM.
Migrate workloads to Av2-series VMs
You can resize your virtual machines to the Av2-series using theAzure portal, PowerShell, or the CLI. Below are examples on how to resize your VM using the Azure portal and PowerShell.
Important
Resizing a virtual machine results in a restart. We recommend that you perform actions that result in a restart during off-peak business hours.
Azure portal
Open theAzure portal.
Typevirtual machinesin the search.
UnderServices, selectVirtual machines.
In theVirtual machinespage, select the virtual machine you want to resize.
In the left menu, selectsize.
Pick a new Av2 size from the list of available sizes and selectResize.
Azure PowerShell
Set the resource group and VM name variables. Replace the values with information of the VM you want to resize.$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$vmName = "myVM"
Set the resource group and VM name variables. Replace the values with information of the VM you want to resize.
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$vmName = "myVM"

$vmName = "myVM"

Resize the VM to the new size.
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -VMName $vmName
$vm.HardwareProfile.VmSize = "<newAv2VMsize>"
Update-AzVM -VM $vm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -VMName $vmName
$vm.HardwareProfile.VmSize = "<newAv2VMsize>"
Update-AzVM -VM $vm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup
