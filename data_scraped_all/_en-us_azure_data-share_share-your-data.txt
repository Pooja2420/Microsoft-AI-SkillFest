In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a new Azure Data Share and start sharing your data with customers and partners outside of your Azure organization.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
Create a Data Share.
Add datasets to your Data Share.
Enable a snapshot schedule for your Data Share.
Add recipients to your Data Share.
Prerequisites
Azure Subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Your recipient's Azure e-mail address (using their e-mail alias won't work).
If the source Azure data store is in a different Azure subscription than the one you'll use to create Data Share resource, register theMicrosoft.DataShare resource providerin the subscription where the Azure data store is located.
Share from a storage account
An Azure Storage account: If you don't already have one, you can create anAzure Storage account
Permission to write to the storage account, which is present inMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write. This permission exists in theStorage Account Contributorrole.
Permission to add role assignment to the storage account, which is present inMicrosoft.Authorization/role assignments/write. This permission exists in theOwnerrole.
Share from a SQL-based source
Below is the list of prerequisites for sharing data from SQL source.
An Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL DW) with tables and views that you want to share.
Permission to write to the databases on SQL server, which is present inMicrosoft.Sql/servers/databases/write. This permission exists in theContributorrole.
Microsoft Entra Adminof the SQL server
SQL Server Firewall access. This can be done through the following steps:In Azure portal, navigate to SQL server. SelectFirewalls and virtual networksfrom left navigation.SelectYesforAllow Azure services and resources to access this server.Select+Add client IP. Client IP address is subject to change. This process might need to be repeated the next time you're sharing SQL data from Azure portal. You can also add an IP range.SelectSave.
