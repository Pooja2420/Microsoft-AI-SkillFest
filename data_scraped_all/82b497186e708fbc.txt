Before you begin, it's a good idea to read the overview page formachine configuration.
Important
The machine configuration extension is required for Azure virtual machines. To deploy the
extension at scale across all machines, assign the following policy initiative:Deploy prerequisites to enable guest configuration policies on virtual machines
Deploy prerequisites to enable guest configuration policies on virtual machines
To use machine configuration packages that apply configurations, Azure VM guest configuration
extension version 1.26.24 or later, or Arc agent 1.10.0 or later, is required.
Custom machine configuration policy definitions usingAuditIfNotExistsas well asDeployIfNotExistsare in Generally Available (GA) support status.

DeployIfNotExists
How machine configuration manages remediation (Set)
Machine configuration uses the policy effectDeployIfNotExistsfor definitions that deliver
changes inside machines. Set the properties of a policy assignment to control howevaluationdelivers configurations automatically or on-demand.
A video walk-through of this document is available.
Machine configuration assignment types
There are three available assignment types when guest assignments are created. The property is
available as a parameter of machine configuration definitions that supportDeployIfNotExists.
DeployIfNotExists
TheassignmentType propertyproperty is case sensitive
Audit
ApplyAndMonitor
NonCompliant
ApplyAndAutoCorrect
When a new policy assignment is assigned to an existing machine, a guest assignment is
automatically created to audit the state of the configuration first. The audit gives you
information you can use to decide which machines need remediation.
Remediation on-demand (ApplyAndMonitor)
By default, machine configuration assignments operate in a remediation on demand scenario. The
configuration is applied and then allowed to drift out of compliance.
The compliance status of the guest assignment isCompliantunless either:
Compliant
An error occurs while applying the configuration
If the machine is no longer in the desired state during the next evaluation
When either of those conditions are met, the agent reports the status asNonCompliantand doesn't
automatically remediate.
NonCompliant
To enable this behavior, set theassignmentType propertyof the machine configuration
assignment toApplyandMonitor. Each time the assignment is processed within the machine, the
agent reportsCompliantfor each resource when theTestmethod returns$trueorNonCompliantif the method returns$false.
ApplyandMonitor
Compliant
$true
NonCompliant
$false
Continuous remediation (autocorrect)
Machine configuration supports the concept ofcontinuous remediation. If the machine drifts out
of compliance for a configuration, the next time it's evaluated the configuration is corrected
automatically. Unless an error occurs, the machine always reports status asCompliantfor the
configuration. There's no way to report when a drift was automatically corrected when using
continuous remediation.
Compliant
To enable this behavior, set theassignmentType propertyof the machine configuration
assignment toApplyandAutoCorrect. Each time the assignment is processed within the machine, theSetmethod runs automatically for each resource theTestmethod returnsfalse.
ApplyandAutoCorrect
false
Disable remediation
When theassignmentTypeproperty is set toAudit, the agent only performs an audit of the
machine and doesn't try to remediate the configuration if it isn't compliant.
Audit
Disable remediation of custom content
You can override the assignment type property for custom content packages by adding a tag to the
machine with nameCustomGuestConfigurationSetPolicyand valuedisable. Adding the tag
disables remediation for custom content packages only, not for built-in content provided by
Microsoft.
disable
Azure Policy enforcement
Azure Policy assignments include a required propertyEnforcement Modethat determines
behavior for new and existing resources. Use this property to control whether configurations are
automatically applied to machines.
By default, enforcement is set toEnabled. Azure Policy automatically applies the configuration
when a new machine is deployed. It also applies the configuration when the properties of a machine
in the scope of an Azure Policy assignment with a policy in the categoryGuest Configurationis
updated. Update operations include actions that occur in Azure Resource Manager, like adding or
changing a tag. Update operations also include changes for virtual machines like resizing or
attaching a disk.
Enabled
Guest Configuration
Leave enforcement enabled if the configuration should be remediated when changes occur to the
machine resource in Azure. Changes happening inside the machine don't trigger automatic remediation
as long as they don't change the machine resource in Azure Resource Manager.
If enforcement is set toDisabled, the configuration assignment audits the state of the machine
until aremediation taskchanges the behavior. By default, machine configuration definitions
update theassignmentType propertyfromAudittoApplyandMonitorso the configuration is
applied one time and then it isn't applied again until a remediation is triggered.
Disabled
Audit
ApplyandMonitor
Optional: Remediate all existing machines
If an Azure Policy assignment is created from the Azure portal, on the "Remediation" tab a checkbox
labeled "Create a remediation task" is available. When the box is checked, after the policy
assignment is created remediation tasks automatically correct any resources that evaluate toNonCompliant.
NonCompliant
The effect of this setting for machine configuration is that you can deploy a configuration across
many machines by assigning a policy. You don't also have to run the remediation task manually for
machines that aren't compliant.
Manually trigger remediation outside of Azure Policy
You can orchestrate remediation outside of the Azure Policy experience by updating a
guest assignment resource, even if the update doesn't make changes to the resource properties.
When a machine configuration assignment is created, thecomplianceStatus propertyis set toPending. The machine configuration service requests a list of assignments every 5 minutes. If the
machine configuration assignment'scomplianceStatusisPendingand itsconfigurationModeisApplyandMonitororApplyandAutoCorrect, the service in the machine applies the
configuration.

After the configuration is applied, the configuration mode dictates whether the behavior is to only
report on compliance status and allow drift or to automatically correct.
