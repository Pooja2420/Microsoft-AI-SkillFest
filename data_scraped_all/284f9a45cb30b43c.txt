To connect to Microsoft cloud services using ExpressRoute, ensure the following requirements are met:
Microsoft 365 was created to be accessed securely and reliably via the Internet. Because of this, we recommend ExpressRoute for specific scenarios. For information about using ExpressRoute to access Microsoft 365, visitAzure ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365.
Azure account
A valid and active Microsoft Azure account is required to set up the ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute circuits are resources within Azure subscriptions. An Azure subscription is necessary even if connectivity is limited to non-Azure Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft 365.
An active Microsoft 365 subscription is needed if using Microsoft 365 services. For more information, see the Microsoft 365 specific requirements section of this article.
Connectivity provider
Work with anExpressRoute connectivity partnerto connect to the Microsoft cloud. You can set up a connection between your on-premises network and Microsoft inthree ways.
If your provider isn't an ExpressRoute connectivity partner, you can still connect to the Microsoft cloud through acloud exchange provider.
Network requirements
Redundancy at each peering location: Microsoft requires redundant BGP sessions between Microsoft's routers and the peering routers on each ExpressRoute circuit, even with justone physical connection to a cloud exchange.
Redundancy for Disaster Recovery: Microsoft strongly recommends setting up at least two ExpressRoute circuits in different peering locations to avoid a single point of failure.
Routing: Depending on your connection method to the Microsoft Cloud, you or your provider needs to set up and manage the BGP sessions forrouting domains. Some Ethernet connectivity providers or cloud exchange providers might offer BGP management as a value-added service.
NAT: Microsoft only accepts public IP addresses through Microsoft peering. If using private IP addresses in your on-premises network, you or your provider needs to translate them to public IP addressesusing NAT.
QoS: Skype for Business services (e.g., voice, video, text) requires differentiated QoS treatment. Follow theQoS requirementswith your provider.
Network Security: Considernetwork securitywhen connecting to the Microsoft Cloud via ExpressRoute.
Microsoft 365 requirements
If you plan to use Microsoft 365 with ExpressRoute, review the following resources for detailed requirements and guidelines:
