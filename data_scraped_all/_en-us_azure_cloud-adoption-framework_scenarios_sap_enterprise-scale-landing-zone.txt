Use the SAP on Azure landing zone accelerator to set up and operate workload landing zones inside your Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zone. The landing zone accelerator provides a specific architectural approach and reference implementation for your SAP systems on Azure.
Deploy the SAP on Azure landing zone accelerator after you successfully implement an enterprise-scale landing zone. Before you deploy the SAP on Azure landing zone accelerator, review theenterprise-scale overviewandimplementation guidance.
Adapt the accelerator to your architecture
The architecture of the SAP on Azure landing zone accelerator varies by organization. Technical considerations and design recommendations lead to configurations that are unique to your organization's specific scenario. The recommendations that this article describes can lead to an architecture that puts your organization on a path to sustainable scaling.
The SAP on Azure landing zone accelerator is modular. You can customize environment variables. The customizable approach to landing zones includes the following assets to support your planning and implementation:

Note
When you deploy a high-availability SAP workload on Azure, it's important to consider the various deployment types that are available. Also consider how to apply them across different Azure regions, such as across zones, in a single zone, or in a region with no zones.
For the highest availability, deploy SAP systems across different zones in a region.
We recommend that you use a flexible virtual machine scale set with aplatformFaultDomainCount(FD) value of1to achieve this availability level. For more information and a discussion of various high-availability deployment options for an SAP workload, seeHigh-availability architecture and scenarios for SAP NetWeaver.

High-level SAP systems architecture
The following diagram is a reference architecture of an SAP systems landscape that includes production and non-production systems. This architecture is one of many options that you can use to deploy SAP systems on Azure. The implementation you choose depends on your requirements.
Use the reference architecture as a starting point. You can download theVisio fileand modify it to fit your specific business and technical requirements when you plan your landing zone implementation.

Workflow
This article provides an example of a high-level, overall SAP architecture that's spread across different tiers.
The SAP systems example architecture describes an SAP systems landscape that has production and non-production systems. Both systems are deployed on virtual machines. You can change the sizes and numbers of virtual machines to accommodate your organization's needs.
This example architecture uses virtual machine scale sets to deploy SAP systems on Azure. The network layout in this example is simplified to demonstrate architectural principles and isn't intended to describe an entire enterprise network.
Recommendations
Your deployment might be different, depending on your business requirements. These recommendations provide a starting point.
The example SAP systems architecture uses the following three subscriptions:
An Azure virtual hub subscriptionthat contains the hub virtual network for the primary and secondary regions.
An Azure virtual hub subscriptionthat contains the hub virtual network for the primary and secondary regions.
An Azure SAP production subscription, where the production and disaster recovery systems are configured.
An Azure SAP production subscription, where the production and disaster recovery systems are configured.
An Azure SAP non-production subscription, where a non-production system includes a sandbox or development, quality assurance, or pre-production systems. This configuration is optional. You can use a subscription for each workload zone.
An Azure SAP non-production subscription, where a non-production system includes a sandbox or development, quality assurance, or pre-production systems. This configuration is optional. You can use a subscription for each workload zone.
The example SAP systems architecture uses a hub-spoke topology. The hub virtual network acts as a central point of connectivity to an on-premises network. The spokes are SAP virtual networks that are peered with the hub. You can use the spokes to isolate workloads.
The architecture uses one SAP virtual network per workload zone. It uses a different SAP virtual network for production, development, quality assurance, and the sandbox. In the architecture, the Azure hub virtual network is peered with the production, development, quality assurance, and sandbox virtual networks. Traffic flows between the on-premises datacenter and the hub through a gateway connection.
Note
Consider setting up a site-to-site (S2S) VPN as a backup of Azure ExpressRoute or for any third-party route requirements. For more information, seeUse S2S VPN as a backup for ExpressRoute private peering.
The architecture subdivides the virtual network address space into subnets. You can associate each subnet with a network security group that defines the access policies for the subnet. Place application servers on a separate subnet so that you can more easily provide security for them. You can manage the subnet security policies instead of managing individual servers. When you associate a network security group with a subnet, the network security group applies to all the servers in the subnet, and you have fine-grained control over the servers.
This architecture has three or four subnets, depending on the tier. For example, a production system might have the following four subnets.
Azure NetApp Files: Adelegated subnetfor using Azure NetApp Files for different SAP on Azure scenarios.
Azure Application Gateway: A subnet that handles traffic coming from the internet. For example, this subnet might handle Fiori apps.
SAP applications: A subnet that contains SAP application servers, SAP Central Services, SAP enqueue replication services instances, and web dispatchers.
Database: A subnet that contains only database virtual machines.
Note
The example SAP systems architecture shows the explicit definition of web dispatchers in a separate virtual machine scale set. The web dispatcher component is a load balancer for SAP traffic among the SAP application servers. To achievehigh availability for SAP Web Dispatcher, Azure Load Balancer implements either the failover cluster or the parallel web dispatcher setup. Set up a standalone solution architecture in a perimeter network for internet-facing communications to help satisfy security concerns.Embedded Web Dispatcher on ASCSdescribes a specific option. Take into account the sizing that's required because of other workloads on SAP ASCS.
For all pools and clusters (SAP Web Dispatcher, SAP application servers, SAP Central Services, and SAP HANA), group the virtual machines in separate virtual machine scale sets. There's no charge for creating a virtual machine scale set. You pay only for each virtual machine that you create.
An Azure availability zone is a unique physical location within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters that are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
When you design for availability zones, check the latency between zones. Knowing the network latency between the zones of a region helps you choose availability zones that have the least network latency for cross-zone network traffic.
When you set up your availability zones, use zone-redundant services for your instances of ExpressRoute,Azure VPN Gateway, andApplication Gateway.
For more information about the availability zone architecture for SAP on Azure, seeSAP HA availability zones.
It is important to ensure all Azure resources used in your workload are set up with Zone-redundant or across availability zones for zonal components. In order to assist in the process assignAzure Policy Initiative for Zone Resilienceto intermediate Management Group. This ensures âstart resilient & stay resilientâ approach. The Zone Resilient built-in policies aim to:
Deliver clear and actionable information that assists in the design, planning, and automation of AZ-resilient deployments.
Detect: Audit subscriptions for non-compliance of these policies.
Prevent configurations using the Deny effect for resources that do not adhere to zone resiliency standards.
Compliance to this initiative can be checked at the end of the Implementation process. More information of the Azure Policy Initiative for Zone Resilience can be found here.
Azure NetApp Files and Azure Files with Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) provide high-availability file share requirements for SAP Central Services, a shared SAP mount, and a global transport directory.
To handle transport directory requirements, use the transport groups option as described inAzure Virtual Machines planning and implementation for SAP NetWeaver. Another way to handle the transport requirements is to make one of the SAP tiers the primary production system that provides the transport directory share to other systems in the landscape.
The high-availability requirements for SAP Central Services differ depending on the operating system. For example:
For a Linux operating system, the shared file systems are typically placed on high-availability NFS storage or Azure NetApp Files instances to provide a high-availability NFS share. For more information, seeNFS over Azure FilesorAzure NetApp Files.
For a Linux operating system, the shared file systems are typically placed on high-availability NFS storage or Azure NetApp Files instances to provide a high-availability NFS share. For more information, seeNFS over Azure FilesorAzure NetApp Files.
For information about high availability on Windows, seeAzure Files with SMBandAzure NetApp Files with SMB.
For information about high availability on Windows, seeAzure Files with SMBandAzure NetApp Files with SMB.
Azure NetApp Files shares can host SAP HANA data and log files. Use this configuration for a HANA scale-out deployment model with standby nodes. Azure NetApp Files supports HANA scale-up orHANA scale-outwith standby nodes.
Azure Filesprovides two main types of endpoints for accessing Azure file shares:
Public endpointshave a public IP address that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
Public endpointshave a public IP address that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
Private endpointsare in a virtual network and have a private IP address within the address space of that virtual network.
Private endpointsare in a virtual network and have a private IP address within the address space of that virtual network.
The example SAP systems architecture usesprivate endpointsso that clients on a virtual network can access data over aprivate link, which improves security.
Azure Private Link is now generally available. SAP Private Link Service currently supports connections from SAP BTP, the Cloud Foundry runtime, and other services on top ofPrivate Link resourcesfor the most common load balancer plus virtual machine scenarios. Example scenarios include SAP S/4HANA or SAP ERP running on the virtual machine and connecting to Azure native services likeAzure Database for MariaDBorAzure Database for MySQL.
The example architecture shows an SAP Private Link Service connection to BTP environments. SAP Private Link Service establishes a private connection between specific SAP BTP services and specific services in your infrastructure as service provider accounts. If you reuse the private link functionality, BTP services can access your S/4 HANA environment through private network connections, which avoids data transfer over the public internet.
For more information about scenarios for connecting to BTP services, see the SAP Community blog post about thearchitecture effect of Private Link Service.
Considerations
Take into account the following considerations when you design your landing zone.
Consider setting up landscape consolidation for non-production systems like sandbox and development environments. For example, consider different use cases:
HANA database scenarios typically run an application and a database in separate virtual machines.
HANA database scenarios typically run an application and a database in separate virtual machines.
AnyDB scenarios might have two-tier deployments in which the SAP application and database run on the same virtual machine.
AnyDB scenarios might have two-tier deployments in which the SAP application and database run on the same virtual machine.
The components are separate in the example SAP systems architecture to provide greater flexibility for maintenance, sizing, monitoring, and change control. Choose a design based on your requirements.
The example architecture has components that you can use for day-2 operations. These components include an Azure Recovery Services vault to back up SAP systems and others that help you extend and improve your SAP data platform with cloud-native Azure data services.
Services like Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Data Lake Storage can help you unlock business insights by combining SAP data with non-SAP data and creating an analytics platform. To evaluate solution development environment design, review thebest practices. You can use different instances of Data Factory and Data Lake Storage based on the SAP tier and best practices for your environment design.
The Azureintegration runtimeis the compute infrastructure that Data Factory and Azure Synapse pipelines use to provide data integration capabilities. Consider deploying runtime virtual machines for these services in each tier. For examples of how to connect with SAP systems and deploy the Azure integration runtime, see these articles:
