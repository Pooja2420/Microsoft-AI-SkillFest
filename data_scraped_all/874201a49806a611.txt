Azure Container Apps exposes each container app through a domain name ifingressis enabled. You can expose ingress endpoints either publicly to the world or to the other container apps in the same environment. Alternatively, you can limit ingress to only other container apps in the sameenvironment.
Application code can call other container apps in the same environment using one of the following methods:
Default fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
A custom domain name
The container app name, for instancehttp://<APP_NAME>for internal requests
http://<APP_NAME>
A Dapr URL
Note
When you call another container in the same environment using the FQDN or app name, the network traffic never leaves the environment.
A sample solution showing how you can call between containers using both the FQDN Location or Dapr can be found onAzure Samples
Location
A container app's location is composed of values associated with its environment, name, and region. Available through theazurecontainerapps.iotop-level domain, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) uses:
azurecontainerapps.io
The container app name
The environment unique identifier
Region name
The following diagram shows how these values are used to compose a container app's fully qualified domain name.

Get fully qualified domain name
Theaz containerapp showcommand returns the fully qualified domain name of a container app.
az containerapp show
Bash
PowerShell
az containerapp show \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn
az containerapp show \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn
(Get-AzContainerApp -Name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>).Configuration.IngressFqdn
(Get-AzContainerApp -Name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>).Configuration.IngressFqdn
In this example, replace the placeholders surrounded by<>with your values.
<>
The value returned from this command resembles a domain name like the following example:
myapp.happyhill-70162bb9.canadacentral.azurecontainerapps.io
myapp.happyhill-70162bb9.canadacentral.azurecontainerapps.io
Dapr location
Developing microservices often requires you to implement patterns common to distributed architecture. Dapr allows you to secure microservices with mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) (client certificates), trigger retries when errors occur, and take advantage of distributed tracing when Azure Application Insights is enabled.
A microservice that uses Dapr is available through the following URL pattern:

Call a container app by name
You can call a container app by doing by sending a request tohttp://<CONTAINER_APP_NAME>from another app in the environment.
http://<CONTAINER_APP_NAME>
