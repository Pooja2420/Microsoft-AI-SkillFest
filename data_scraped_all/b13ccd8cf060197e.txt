This article shows you how to use the Azure portal to set up Service Health alerts.
Service Health notifications are stored in theAzure activity log. Given the large volume of information stored in the activity log, there is a separate user interface to make it easier to view and set up alerts on service health notifications.
You can receive an alert when Azure sends Service Health notifications to your Azure subscription. You can configure the alert based on:
The class of service health notification (Service issues, Planned maintenance, Health advisories, Security advisories)
The subscription that is affected
The services that are affected
The regions that are affected
Note
Service Health notifications do not send alerts for resource health events.
You also can configure who the alert should be sent to:
Select an existing action group.
Create a new action group (that can be used for future alerts).
Note
Service Health Alerts are only supported in public clouds within the global region. For Action Groups to properly function in response to a Service Health Alert, the region of the action group must be set as "Global".
To learn more about action groups, seeCreate and manage action groups.
For information on how to configure service health notification alerts by using Azure Resource Manager templates, seeResource Manager templates.
