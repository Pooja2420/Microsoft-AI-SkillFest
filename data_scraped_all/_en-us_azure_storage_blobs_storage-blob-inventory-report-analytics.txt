By understanding how your blobs and containers are stored, organized, and used in production, you can better optimize the tradeoffs between cost and performance.
This tutorial shows you how to generate and visualize statistics such as data growth over time, data added over time, number of files modified, blob snapshot sizes, access patterns over each tier, and how data is distributed both currently and over time (For example: data across tiers, file types, in containers, and blob types).
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Generate a blob inventory report
Set up a Synapse workspace
Set up Synapse Studio
Generate analytic data in Synapse Studio
Visualize results in Power BI
Prerequisites

Make sure that your user identity has theStorage Blob Data Contributor roleassigned to it.
Generate an inventory report
Enable blob inventory reports for your storage account. SeeEnable Azure Storage blob inventory reports.
You might have to wait up to 24 hours after enabling inventory reports for your first report to be generated.
Set up a Synapse workspace
Create an Azure Synapse workspace. SeeCreate an Azure Synapse workspace.NoteAs part of creating the workspace, you'll create a storage account that has a hierarchical namespace. Azure Synapse stores Spark tables and application logs to this account. Azure Synapse refers to this account as theprimary storage account. To avoid confusion, this article uses the terminventory report accountto refer to the account which contains inventory reports.

Give the Synapse workspace permission to access the inventory reports in your storage account by navigating to your inventory report account, and then assigning theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole to the system managed identity of the workspace. SeeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.

Set up and run the sample notebook
In this section, you'll generate statistical data that you'll visualize in a report. To simplify this tutorial, this section uses a sample configuration file and a sample PySpark notebook. The notebook contains a collection of queries that execute in Azure Synapse Studio.

Next steps
Set up an Azure Synapse pipeline to keep running your notebook at regular intervals. That way you can process new inventory reports as they're created. After the initial run, each of the next runs will analyze incremental data and then update the tables with the results of that analysis. For guidance, seeIntegrate with pipelines.
