The Microsoft Azure Windows VM Agent is a secure, lightweight process that manages virtual machine (VM) interaction with the Azure fabric controller. The Azure Windows VM Agent has a primary role in enabling and executing Azure virtual machine extensions. VM extensions enable post-deployment configuration of VMs, such as installing and configuring software. VM extensions also enable recovery features such as resetting the administrative password of a VM. Without the Azure Windows VM Agent, you can't run VM extensions.
This article describes how to install and detect the Azure Windows VM Agent.
Prerequisites
The Azure Windows VM Agent supports the x64 architecture for these Windows operating systems:
Important
The Azure Windows VM Agent needs at least Windows Server 2008 SP2 (64-bit) to run, with the .NET Framework 4.0. SeeMinimum version support for virtual machine agents in Azure.

Ensure that your VM has access to IP address 168.63.129.16. For more information, seeWhat is IP address 168.63.129.16?.

Ensure that DHCP is enabled inside the guest VM. This is required to get the host or fabric address from DHCP for the Azure Windows VM Agent and extensions to work. If you need a static private IP address, you should configure it through the Azure portal or PowerShell, and make sure the DHCP option inside the VM is enabled.Learn moreabout setting up a static IP address by using PowerShell.

Running the Azure Windows VM Agent in a nested virtualization VM might lead to unpredictable behavior, so it's not supported in that dev/test scenario.

Install the Azure Windows VM Agent
Azure Marketplace image
The Azure Windows VM Agent is installed by default on any Windows VM deployed from an Azure Marketplace image. When you deploy an Azure Marketplace image from the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or an Azure Resource Manager template, the Azure Windows VM Agent is also installed.
The Azure Windows VM Agent package has two parts:
Azure Windows Provisioning Agent (PA)
Azure Windows Guest Agent (WinGA)
To boot a VM, you must have the PA installed on the VM. However, the WinGA does not need to be installed. At VM deploy time, you can select not to install the WinGA. The following example shows how to select theprovisionVmAgentoption with an Azure Resource Manager template:
provisionVmAgent
{
	"resources": [{
		"name": ["parameters('virtualMachineName')"],
		"type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
		"apiVersion": "2016-04-30-preview",
		"location": ["parameters('location')"],
		"dependsOn": ["[concat('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/', parameters('networkInterfaceName'))]"],
		"properties": {
			"osProfile": {
				"computerName": ["parameters('virtualMachineName')"],
				"adminUsername": ["parameters('adminUsername')"],
				"adminPassword": ["parameters('adminPassword')"],
				"windowsConfiguration": {
					"provisionVmAgent": "false"
				}
			}
		}
	}]
}
{
	"resources": [{
		"name": ["parameters('virtualMachineName')"],
		"type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
		"apiVersion": "2016-04-30-preview",
		"location": ["parameters('location')"],
		"dependsOn": ["[concat('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/', parameters('networkInterfaceName'))]"],
		"properties": {
			"osProfile": {
				"computerName": ["parameters('virtualMachineName')"],
				"adminUsername": ["parameters('adminUsername')"],
				"adminPassword": ["parameters('adminPassword')"],
				"windowsConfiguration": {
					"provisionVmAgent": "false"
				}
			}
		}
	}]
}
If you don't have the agents installed, you can't use some Azure services, such as Azure Backup or Azure Security. These services require an extension to be installed. If you deploy a VM without the WinGA, you can install the latest version of the agent later.
Manual installation
You can manually install the Azure Windows VM Agent by using a Windows Installer package. Manual installation might be necessary when you create a custom VM image that's deployed to Azure.
To manually install the Azure Windows VM Agent,download the installerand select the latest release. You can also search for a specific version in theGitHub page for Azure Windows VM Agent releases. The Azure Windows VM Agent is supported on Windows Server 2008 (64 bit) and later.
Note
If a VM was created from a custom or Marketplace image withoutProvisionVMAgentenabled, then it is important to update theAllowExtensionOperationstotrueafter you manually install the Azure Windows VM Agent.
ProvisionVMAgent
AllowExtensionOperations
true
This is NOT required if the VM was created from a specialized disk. For example, if the VM was created directly from an existing disk.
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <VM Name> -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group Name>
$vm.OSProfile.AllowExtensionOperations = $true
$vm | Update-AzVM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <VM Name> -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group Name>
$vm.OSProfile.AllowExtensionOperations = $true
$vm | Update-AzVM
Detect the Azure Windows VM Agent
PowerShell
You can use the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell module to get information about Azure VMs. To see information about a VM, such as the provisioning state for the Azure Windows VM Agent, useGet-AzVM:
Get-AzVM
Get-AzVM
The following condensed example output shows theProvisionVMAgentproperty nested insideOSProfile. You can use this property to determine if the VM agent has been deployed to the VM.
ProvisionVMAgent
OSProfile
OSProfile                  :
  ComputerName             : myVM
  AdminUsername            : myUserName
  WindowsConfiguration     :
    ProvisionVMAgent       : True
    EnableAutomaticUpdates : True
OSProfile                  :
  ComputerName             : myVM
  AdminUsername            : myUserName
  WindowsConfiguration     :
    ProvisionVMAgent       : True
    EnableAutomaticUpdates : True
Use the following script to return a concise list of VM names (running Windows OS) and the state of the Azure Windows VM Agent:
$vms = Get-AzVM

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    $agent = $vm | Select -ExpandProperty OSProfile | Select -ExpandProperty Windowsconfiguration | Select ProvisionVMAgent
    Write-Host $vm.Name $agent.ProvisionVMAgent
}
$vms = Get-AzVM

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    $agent = $vm | Select -ExpandProperty OSProfile | Select -ExpandProperty Windowsconfiguration | Select ProvisionVMAgent
    Write-Host $vm.Name $agent.ProvisionVMAgent
}
Use the following script to return a concise list of VM names (running Linux OS) and the state of the Azure Windows VM Agent:
$vms = Get-AzVM

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    $agent = $vm | Select -ExpandProperty OSProfile | Select -ExpandProperty Linuxconfiguration | Select ProvisionVMAgent
    Write-Host $vm.Name $agent.ProvisionVMAgent
}
$vms = Get-AzVM

foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    $agent = $vm | Select -ExpandProperty OSProfile | Select -ExpandProperty Linuxconfiguration | Select ProvisionVMAgent
    Write-Host $vm.Name $agent.ProvisionVMAgent
}
Manual detection
When you're logged in to a Windows VM, you can use Task Manager to examine running processes. To check for the Azure Windows VM Agent, open Task Manager, select theDetailstab, and look for a process namedWindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe. The presence of this process indicates that the VM agent is installed.
Upgrade the Azure Windows VM Agent
The Azure Windows VM Agent for Windows is automatically upgraded on images deployed from Azure Marketplace. The new versions are stored in Azure Storage, so ensure that you don't have firewalls blocking access. As new VMs are deployed to Azure, they receive the latest VM agent at VM provision time. If you installed the agent manually or are deploying custom VM images, you need to manually update to include the new VM agent at image creation time.
Azure Windows Guest Agent automatic log collection
The Azure Windows Guest Agent has a feature to automatically collect some logs. TheCollectGuestLogs.exeprocess controls this feature. It exists for both platform as a service (PaaS) cloud services and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) VMs. Its goal is to quickly and automatically collect diagnostics logs from a VM, so they can be used for offline analysis.
The collected logs are event logs, OS logs, Azure logs, and some registry keys. The agent produces a ZIP file that's transferred to the VM's host. Engineering teams and support professionals can then use this ZIP file to investigate issues on the request of the customer who owns the VM.
Azure Windows Guest Agent and OSProfile certificates
The Azure Windows VM Agent installs the certificates referenced in theOSProfilevalue of a VM or a virtual machine scale set. If you manually remove these certificates from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Certificates snap-in inside the guest VM, the Azure Windows Guest Agent will add them back. To permanently remove a certificate, you have to remove it fromOSProfile, and then remove it from within the guest operating system.

For a virtual machine, useRemove-AzVMSecretto remove certificates fromOSProfile.
