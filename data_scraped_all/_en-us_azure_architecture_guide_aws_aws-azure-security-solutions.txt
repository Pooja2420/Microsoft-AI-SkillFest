Microsoft Entra
Centralized identity and access management
Microsoft Entra ID is a comprehensive, cloud-based centralized identity and access management solution that can help secure and protect AWS accounts and environments.
Microsoft Entra ID provides strong SSO authentication to almost any app or platform that follows common web authentication standards, including AWS. AWS accounts that support critical workloads and highly sensitive information need strong identity protection and access control. AWS identity management is enhanced when you combine it with Microsoft Entra ID.
AWS organizations that use Microsoft Entra ID for Microsoft 365 or hybrid cloud identity and access protection can quickly and easily deploy Microsoft Entra ID for AWS accounts, often without incurring additional costs. Microsoft Entra ID provides several capabilities for direct integration with AWS:
Integration with AWS IAM Identity Center for enhanced security, improved user experience, centralized access control, and SSO across legacy, traditional, and modern authentication solutions.

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time provisioning of specific resources. You can expand PIM to any delegated permission by controlling access to custom groups, like groups that you create for access to AWS roles.

Microsoft Entra Permissions Management
Permissions Management is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management solution that provides comprehensive visibility into and control over permissions on identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructure on Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform. You can use Permissions Management to:
Discover the number of unused or excessive permissions across all AWS accounts to identify risks via a multidimensional view of identities, permissions, and resources.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
When several users or roles make administrative changes,configuration driftaway from intended security architecture and standards can occur. Security standards can also change over time. Security personnel must constantly and consistently detect new risks, evaluate mitigation options, and update security architecture to help prevent potential breaches. Security management across multiple public cloud and private infrastructure environments can become burdensome.
Defender for Cloud Apps provides enhanced protection for software as a service (SaaS) applications. It provides the following features to help you monitor and protect your cloud app data:
Fundamental Cloud Access Security Broker functionality, including shadow IT discovery, visibility into cloud app usage, enhanced protection against app-based threats from anywhere in the cloud, and information protection and compliance assessments.

Connecting AWS to Defender for Cloud Apps helps you secure your assets and detect potential threats by monitoring administrative and sign-in activities. You get notifications of possible brute force attacks, malicious use of privileged user accounts, unusual deletions of VMs, and publicly exposed storage buckets. Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect AWS environments from abuse of cloud resources, compromised accounts and insider threats, data leakage, and resource misconfiguration and insufficient access control. The following Defender for Cloud Apps capabilities are especially useful when you work with AWS environments.
Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, malicious insiders, and ransomware. Defender for Cloud Apps anomaly detection policies are triggered when there are unusual activities performed by users in AWS. Defender for Cloud Apps continually monitors your users' activities and uses UEBA and machine learning to learn and understand the typical behavior of your users and trigger alerts on any deviations.

Microsoft Sentinel
Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) system that provides an intelligent and comprehensive solution for SIEM and security orchestration, automation, and response. Microsoft Sentinel provides cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting. It gives you a bird's-eye view across your enterprise.
You can use the AWS connectors to pull AWS service logs into Microsoft Sentinel. These connectors work by granting Microsoft Sentinel access to your AWS resource logs. Setting up the connector establishes a trust relationship between AWS and Microsoft Sentinel. You create this relationship on AWS by creating a role that gives permission to Microsoft Sentinel to access your AWS logs.
The connector can ingest logs from the following AWS services by pulling them from an S3 bucket:
For more information on how to install and configure the AWS connector in Microsoft Sentinel, seeConnect Microsoft Sentinel to Amazon Web Services to ingest AWS service log data.
Recommendations
Use the Microsoft security solutions and basic AWS security recommendations to protect AWS accounts.
For information about basic security hygiene for AWS accounts and resources, review the AWS security guidance atBest practices for securing AWS accounts and resources.
Reduce the risk of uploading and downloading malware and other malicious content by actively inspecting all data transfers via the AWS Management Console. Content that you upload or download directly to resources within the AWS platform, such as web servers or databases, might need additional protection.

Provide security for access keys by rotating the keys periodically. Avoid embedding them in code. Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys wherever possible.
