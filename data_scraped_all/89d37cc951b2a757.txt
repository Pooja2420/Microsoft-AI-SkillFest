Dedicated SQL pool measures performance in compute data warehouse units (DWUs). Rather than surfacing details of individual nodes such as memory per node or number of CPUs per node, metrics such asMemoryUsedPercentandCPUPercentshow general usage trend over a period of time. These trends help administrators understand how a dedicated SQL pool instance is utilized. Changes in memory or CPU footprint could be a trigger for actions such as scale-up or scale-down of DWUs, or investigating queries that might require optimization.

MemoryUsedPercent
CPUPercent
DWUUsedrepresents only high-level usage across the SQL pool and isn't a comprehensive indicator of utilization. To determine whether to scale up or down, consider all factors that DWU can impact, such as concurrency, memory, tempdb size, and adaptive cache capacity.Run your workload at different DWU settingsto determine what works best to meet your business objectives.

MemoryUsedPercentreflects utilization even if the data warehouse is idle, not active workload memory consumption. Track this metric along with tempdb size and Gen2 cache to decide whether you need to scale for more cache capacity to increase workload performance.
