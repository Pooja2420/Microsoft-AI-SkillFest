SQL Server
Reference

Connect to SQL Server so that you can manange your SQL database.
This article describes the operations for the SQL Serverbuilt-inconnector, which is availableonlyfor Standard workflows in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. If you're looking for the SQL Servermanagedconnector operations instead, seeSQL Server managed connector reference.
Built-in connector settings
In a Standard logic app resource, the SQL Server built-in connector includes settings that control various thresholds for performance, throughput, capacity, and so on. For example, you can change the query timeout value for SQL operations. For more information, reviewReference for app settings - local.settings.json.
Enable authentication for SQL Server
With the built-in connector, you can authenticate your connection with either a managed identity, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), or a connection string. For managed identity authentication or Azure Active Directory authentication, you have to set up your SQL Server to work with these authentication types. For more information, seeAuthentication - SQL Server managed connector reference.
