Manage lab VMs
On this page, you can start, stop, or reimage lab user's VMs by using controls in theStatecolumn or on the toolbar.

For more information about managing virtual machine pool for the lab, seeSet up and manage virtual machine pool.
Note
When an educator turns on a lab user's VM, quota for the lab user isn't affected. Quota for a user specifies the number of lab hours available to the user outside of the scheduled class time. For more information on quotas, seeSet quotas for users.
