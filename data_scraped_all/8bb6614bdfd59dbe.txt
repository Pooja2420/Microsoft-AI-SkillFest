Enhanced container protection with vulnerability assessment and malware detection for AKS nodes is now GA
March 30, 2025
Defender for Cloud now provides vulnerability assessment and malware detection for the nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as GA.
Providing security protection for these Kubernetes nodes allow customers to maintain security and compliance across the managed Kubernetes service, as well as understand their part in the shared security responsibility they have with the managed cloud provider.
To receive the new capabilities, you have to enable theAgentless scanning for machines"** as part of Defender CSPM, Defender for Containers, or Defender for Servers P2 plan on your subscription.
A new recommendation is now available in Azure portal:AKS nodes should have vulnerability findings resolved.Using this recommendation, you can now review and remediate vulnerabilities and CVEs found on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.
New security alerts are triggered when the agentless malware detection capability detects malware in AKS nodes.
Agentless malware detection uses the Microsoft Defender Antivirus anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. When threats are detected, security alerts are directed into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated.
Note:Malware detection for AKS nodes is available only for Defender for Containers or Defender for Servers P2 enabled environments.
Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview)
March 27, 2025
We're introducing the Kubernetes gated deployment (Preview) feature to the Defender for Containers plan. Kubernetes gated deployment is a mechanism for enhancing Kubernetes security by controlling the deployment of container images that violate organizational security policies.
This capability is based on two new functionalities:
Vulnerability findings artifact: Generation of findings for each container image scanned for vulnerability assessment.
Security rules: Addition of security rules to alert or prevent the deployment of vulnerable container images into Kubernetes clusters.
Customized security rules: Customers can customize security rules for various environments, for Kubernetes clusters within their organization, or for namespaces, to enable security controls tailored to specific needs and compliance requirements.
Configurable actions for a security rule:
Audit: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers an "Audit" action, generating a recommendation with violation details on the container image.
Audit: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers an "Audit" action, generating a recommendation with violation details on the container image.
Deny: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers a "Deny" action to prevent deployment of the container image, ensuring that only secure and compliant images are deployed.
Deny: Attempting to deploy a vulnerable container image triggers a "Deny" action to prevent deployment of the container image, ensuring that only secure and compliant images are deployed.
End-to-End Security: Defining protection from deployment of vulnerable container images as the first security rule, we introduce the end-to-end Kubernetes secure gating mechanism, ensuring that vulnerable containers don't enter the customer's Kubernetes environment.
For more information about this feature, seeâ¯Gated Deployment solution overview.

Upcoming change to the recommendation severity levels
March 11, 2025
We're enhancing the severity levels of recommendations to improve risk assessment and prioritization. As part of this update, we reevaluated all severity classifications and introduced a new level â Critical. Previously, recommendations were categorized into three levels: Low, Medium, and High. With this update, there are now four distinct levels: Low, Medium, High, and Critical, providing a more granular risk evaluation to help customers focus on the most urgent security issues.
As a result, customers might notice changes in the severity of existing recommendations. Additionally, the risk level evaluation, which is available for Defender CSPM customers only, might also be affected as both recommendation severity and asset context are taken into consideration. These adjustments could affect the overall risk level.
The projected change will take place on March 25, 2025.
