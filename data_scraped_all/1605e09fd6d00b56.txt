TheAzure Well-Architected Azure Virtual Desktop workload assessmentis a review tool for self-assessing the readiness of your Azure Virtual Desktop workload in production. Running a desktop and application virtualization service on Azure can be a complex process. The assessment is organized so that you can methodically check your alignment with best practices for the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars.
For best results, the team that completes the assessment should be well versed in the architecture of your workload. That team should also have a strong understanding of cloud principles and patterns. These roles include but aren't limited to cloud architects, operators, and DevOps engineers.
The assessment is a set of questions that are based on theAzure Virtual Desktop design principlesas a way of checking the foundational design choices of your workload's architecture and your end-to-end operational approach.

These questions are designed to help benchmark your workload's maturity and alignment with the recommended approach for operating an Azure Virtual Desktop workload. The outcome of the assessment is the delivery of technical recommendations and documentation that provide guidance on how to implement a highly reliable solution on Azure.
