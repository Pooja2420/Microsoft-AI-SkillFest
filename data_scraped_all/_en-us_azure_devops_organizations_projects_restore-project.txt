If a project becomes obsolete, you candelete itfrom your organization or collection in Azure DevOps. If you're migrating from an on-premises Azure DevOps Server to Azure DevOps Services, you might also need to delete the project. Removing unused projects can enhance navigation by limiting it to only those projects that are currently in use.
Caution
Soft-deleted projects from the web portal are permanently removed if not restored within 28 days.
In rare cases, our deletion process might take up to 70 days due to backend retries and the need to delete data from multiple sources.
Hard-deleted projects from the on-premises Azure DevOps Administration Console can't be restored.
For more information, seeRestore a projectandSave project data.
Prerequisites
Save project data
Use the following procedures to save data that users most care about, such as source code, build data, and work items. This procedure is optional and something you might consider before you delete a project.
Source code and custom build templates:Download your files as a zip file. Selectfor the repository, file, or folder and selectDownload as Zip. Or, selectDownloadto download either all of the files in the currently selected folder, or the currently selected file.This process doesn't save any change history or links to other artifacts.

id: Required. The ID of the project you want to delete. To determine the ID of a project, use theaz devops project listcommand.
org: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization usingaz devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL. Required if not configured as default or picked up usinggit config. Example:--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/.
az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL
git config
--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/
yes: Don't prompt for confirmation.
The following command deletes the team project with the specified ID without prompting you for confirmation.
az devops project delete --id 9a61d475-b1a7-4da7-b9db-80df15ac985c --yes
az devops project delete --id 9a61d475-b1a7-4da7-b9db-80df15ac985c --yes
Azure DevOps CLI commands aren't supported for Azure DevOps Server.
Delete reports that remain after deleting a project
If your project used SQL Server reporting and you didn't delete external artifacts, you can delete the reports using SQL Server Report Manager. From the project collection page, delete the folder that corresponds to the deleted project.
