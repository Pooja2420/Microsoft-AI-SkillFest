Azure confidential virtual machinessupports the creation and sharing of custom images using Azure Compute Gallery. There are two types of images that you can create, based on the security types of the image:
Confidential VM (ConfidentialVM) imagesare images where the source already has theVM Guest state information. This image type might also have confidential disk encryption enabled.
ConfidentialVM
Confidential VM supported (ConfidentialVMSupported) imagesare images where the source doesn't have VM Guest state information and confidential disk encryption is not enabled.
ConfidentialVMSupported
Confidential VM images
For the following image sources, the security type on the image definition should be set toConfidentialVMas the image source already hasVM Guest State informationand may also have confidential disk encryption enabled:
ConfidentialVM
Confidential VM capture
Managed OS disk
Managed OS disk snapshot
The resulting image version can be used only to create confidential VMs.
This image version can be replicated within the source regionbut cannot be replicated to a different regionor across subscriptions currently.
Note
If you want to create an image from a Windows confidential VM that has confidential compute disk encryption enabled with a platform-managed key or a customer-managed key, you can only create a specialized image. This limitation exists because the generalization tool (sysprep), might not be able to generalized the encrypted image source. This limitation applies to the OS disk, which is implicitly created along with the Windows confidential VM, and the snapshot created from this OS disk.
Create a Confidential VM type image using Confidential VM capture
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Go to theVirtual machinesservice.
Open the confidential VM that you want to use as the image source.
If you want to create a generalized image,remove machine-specific informationbefore you create the image.
SelectCapture.
In theCreate an imagepage that opens,create your image definition and version.Allow the image to be shared to Azure Compute Gallery as a VM image version. Managed images aren't supported for confidential VMs.Either create a new gallery, or select an existing gallery.For theOperating system state, select eitherGeneralizedorSpecialized, depending on your use case.Create an image definition by providing a name, publisher, offer, and SKU details. Make sure the security type is set toConfidential.Provide a version number for the image.ForReplication, modify the replica count, if required.SelectReview + Create.When the image validation succeeds, selectCreateto finish creating the image.

Either create a new gallery, or select an existing gallery.

Create an image definition by providing a name, publisher, offer, and SKU details. Make sure the security type is set toConfidential.
Provide a version number for the image.
ForReplication, modify the replica count, if required.
SelectReview + Create.
When the image validation succeeds, selectCreateto finish creating the image.
Select the image version to go to the resource directly. Or, you can go to the image version through the image definition. The image definition also shows the encryption type, so you can check that the image and source VM match.
On the image version page, selectCreate VM.
Now, you cancreate a Confidential VM from your custom image.
Create a Confidential VM type image from managed disk or snapshot
Sign in to theAzure portal.
If you want to create a generalized image,remove machine-specific informationfor the disk or snapshot before you create the image.
Search for and selectVM Image Versionsin the search bar.
SelectCreate
On theCreate VM image versionpage'sBasicstab:Select an Azure subscription.Select an existing resource group, or create a new resource group.Select an Azure region.Enter a version number for the image.ForSource, selectDisks and/or Snapshots.ForOS disk, select either a managed disk or managed disk snapshot.ForTarget Azure compute gallery, select or create a gallery to share the image in.ForOperating system state, select eitherGeneralizedorSpecializeddepending on your use case.ForTarget VM image definition, selectCreate new.In theCreate a VM image definitionpane, enter a name for the definition. Make sure theSecurity typeisConfidential. Enter the publisher, offer, and SKU information. Then, selectOk.
Select an Azure subscription.
Select an existing resource group, or create a new resource group.
Select an Azure region.
Enter a version number for the image.
ForSource, selectDisks and/or Snapshots.
ForOS disk, select either a managed disk or managed disk snapshot.
ForTarget Azure compute gallery, select or create a gallery to share the image in.
ForOperating system state, select eitherGeneralizedorSpecializeddepending on your use case.
ForTarget VM image definition, selectCreate new.
In theCreate a VM image definitionpane, enter a name for the definition. Make sure theSecurity typeisConfidential. Enter the publisher, offer, and SKU information. Then, selectOk.
On theEncryptiontab, make sure theConfidential compute encryption typematches the source disk or snapshot's type.
SelectReview + Createto review your settings.
After the settings are validated, selectCreateto finish creating the image version.
After the image version is successfully created, selectCreate VM.
Now, you cancreate a Confidential VM from your custom image.
Confidential VM Supported images
For the following image sources, the security type on the image definition should be set toConfidentialVMSupportedas the image source does not have VM Guest state information and confidential disk encryption:
ConfidentialVMSupported
OS Disk VHD
Gen2 Managed Image
The resulting image version can be used to create either Azure Gen2 VMs or confidential VMs.
This image can be replicated within the source region and to different target regions.
Note
The OS disk VHD or Managed Image should be created from an image that is compatible with confidential VM. The size of the VHD or managed image should be less than 32 GB
Create a Confidential VM Supported type image
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search for and selectVM image versionsin the search bar
On theVM image versionspage, selectCreate.

Then, provide a confidential disk encryption set, if you want to use customer-managed keys.
