Azure is no longer publishing CoreMark since the metric has limited ability to inform users of the expected performance of a virtual machine across various attributes. For the most accurate results on a specific virtual machine, Azure recommends users run their workload(s) on that virtual machine to verify performance.
The following CoreMark benchmark scores show compute performance for select Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019. Compute benchmark scores are also available forLinux VMs.

About CoreMark
CoreMarkis a benchmark that tests the functionality of a microcontroller (MCU) or central processing unit (CPU). CoreMark isn't system dependent, so it functions the same regardless of the platform (for example, big or little endian, high-end or low-end processor).
Windows numbers were computed by running CoreMark on Windows Server 2019. CoreMark was configured with the number of threads set to the number of virtual CPUs, and concurrency set toPThreads. The target number of iterations was adjusted based on expected performance to provide a runtime of at least 20 seconds (typically much longer). The final score represents the number of iterations completed divided by the number of seconds it took to run the test. Each test was run at least seven times on each VM. Test run dates shown above. Tests run on multiple VMs across Azure public regions the VM was supported in on the date run.

(Coremark doesn't properly support more than 64 vCPUs on Windows, therefore SKUs with > 64 vCPUs have been marked as N/A.)

Running Coremark on Azure VMs
Download:
CoreMark is an open source tool that can be downloaded fromGitHub.
Building and Running:
To build and run the benchmark, type:
> make
> make
Full results are available in the filesrun1.logandrun2.log.run1.logcontains CoreMark results with performance parameters.run2.logcontains benchmark results with validation parameters.
run1.log
run2.log
run1.log
run2.log
Run Time:
By default, the benchmark will run between 10-100 seconds. To override, useITERATIONS=N
ITERATIONS=N
% make ITERATIONS=10
% make ITERATIONS=10
above flag will run the benchmark for 10 iterations.Results are only valid for reporting if the benchmark ran for at least 10 seconds!
Parallel Execution:
UseXCFLAGS=-DMULTITHREAD=Nwhere N is number of threads to run in parallel. Several implementations are available to execute in multiple contexts.
XCFLAGS=-DMULTITHREAD=N
% make XCFLAGS="-DMULTITHREAD=4 -DUSE_PTHREAD"
% make XCFLAGS="-DMULTITHREAD=4 -DUSE_PTHREAD"
The above will compile the benchmark for execution on 4 cores.
Recommendations for best results
The benchmark needs to run for at least 10 seconds, probably longer on larger systems.
All source files must be compiled with same flags.
Don't change source files other thancore_portme*(usemake checkto validate)
core_portme*
make check
Multiple runs are suggested for best results.
GPU Series
Performance of GPU based VM series is best understood by using GPU appropriate benchmarks and running at the scale required for your workloads. Azure ranks among the best there:
Top 10 Supercomputer:November 2021 | TOP500(Azure powered #10: Voyager-EUS2)
Machine Learning: MLCommons Training:v1.1 Results | MLCommons(2 highest at scale and largest in the cloud)
