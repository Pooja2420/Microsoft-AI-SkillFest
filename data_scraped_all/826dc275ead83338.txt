Cluster extensions provide an Azure Resource Manager driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of services like Azure Machine Learning or Kubernetes applications on an AKS cluster. This feature enables:
Azure Resource Manager-based deployment of extensions, including at-scale deployments across AKS clusters.
Lifecycle management of the extension (Update, Delete) from Azure Resource Manager
Cluster extension requirements
Cluster extensions can be used on AKS clusters in the regions listed inAzure Arc enabled Kubernetes region support.
For supported Kubernetes versions, refer to the corresponding documentation for each extension.
Important
Ensure that your AKS cluster is created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions won't work with service principal-based clusters.
For new clusters created withaz aks create, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters that need to be switched over to managed identity, it can be enabled by runningaz aks updatewith the--enable-managed-identityflag. For more information, seeUse managed identity.
az aks create
az aks update
--enable-managed-identity
Note
If you have enabledMicrosoft Entra pod-managed identityon your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you first reviewWorkload identity overviewto understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.
The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.
Currently available extensions
You can alsoselect and deploy Kubernetes applications available through Marketplace.
Note
Cluster extensions provides a platform for different extensions to be installed and managed on an AKS cluster. If you are facing issues while using any of these extensions, please open a support ticket with the respective service.
