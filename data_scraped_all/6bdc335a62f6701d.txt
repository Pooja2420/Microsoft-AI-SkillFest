Get started with Azure Load Balancer by using the Azure portal to create a public load balancer for a backend pool with two virtual machines. Other resources include Azure Bastion, NAT Gateway, a virtual network, and the required subnets.

Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create NAT gateway
In this section, you create a NAT gateway for outbound internet access for resources in the virtual network. For other options for outbound rules, check outNetwork Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections
Sign in to theAzure portal.

In the search box at the top of the portal, enterNAT gateway. SelectNAT gatewaysin the search results.

Create a virtual network and bastion host
In this section, you create a virtual network with a resource subnet, an Azure Bastion subnet, and an Azure Bastion host.
Important
Hourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Create load balancer
In this section, you create a zone redundant load balancer that load balances virtual machines. With zone-redundancy, one or more availability zones can fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy.
During the creation of the load balancer, you configure:
Frontend IP address
Backend pool
Inbound load-balancing rules
Health probe
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterLoad balancer. SelectLoad balancersin the search results.

Create virtual machines
In this section, you create two VMs (lb-vm1andlb-VM2) in two different zones (Zone 1andZone 2).
These VMs are added to the backend pool of the load balancer that was created earlier.

Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.

Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the resource group, load balancer, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource groupload-balancer-rgthat contains the resources and then selectDelete.
