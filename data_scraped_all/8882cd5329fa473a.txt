Remarks
Important
This task is supported with Azure Repos Git repositories only.
Prerequisites
For the task to successfully complete and populate the Advanced Security tab for the scanned repository,Advanced Securitymust be enabled for that repository prior to running a build with the dependency scanning task included.
The task is available to run on self-hosted agents as well as Microsoft-hosted agents. For self-hosted agents, seeadditional self-hosted agent set-up instructions.
The pipeline must call the tasks in the following order.
Initialize CodeQL
AutoBuild (or your custom build tasks)
Perform CodeQL analysis
The AutoBuild task is optional and may be replaced with your custom build tasks. Either AutoBuild or your custom build tasks must be run for your project to be analyzed.
The analysis task must appear after the initialize task for successful completion.
