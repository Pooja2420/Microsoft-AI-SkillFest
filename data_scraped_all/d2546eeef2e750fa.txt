In this quickstart, you use the "Prompt Shields" feature. Prompt Shields in Azure AI Content Safety are designed to safeguard generative AI systems from generating harmful or inappropriate content. These shields detect and mitigate risks associated with both User Prompt Attacks (malicious or harmful user-generated inputs) and Document Attacks (inputs containing harmful content embedded within documents). The use of "Prompt Shields" is crucial in environments where GenAI is employed, ensuring that AI outputs remain safe, compliant, and trustworthy.
The primary objectives of the "Prompt Shields" feature for GenAI applications are:
To detect and block harmful or policy-violating user prompts that could lead to unsafe AI outputs.
To identify and mitigate document attacks where harmful content is embedded within user-provided documents.
To maintain the integrity, safety, and compliance of AI-generated content, preventing misuse of GenAI systems.
For more information on Prompt Shields, see thePrompt Shields concept page. For API input limits, see theInput requirementssection of the Overview.
Prerequisites
An Azure account. If you don't have one, you cancreate one for free.
AnAzure AI resource.
Setup
Follow these steps to use the Content Safetytry it outpage:
Go toAzure AI Foundryand navigate to your project/hub. Then select theSafety+ Securitytab on the left nav and select theTry it outtab.
On theTry it outpage, you can experiment with various content safety features such as text and image content, using adjustable thresholds to filter for inappropriate or harmful content.

Use Prompt Shields
ThePrompt Shieldspanel lets you try out user input risk detection. Detect User Prompts designed to provoke the Generative AI model into exhibiting behaviors it was trained to avoid or break the rules set in the System Message. These attacks can vary from intricate role-play to subtle subversion of the safety objective.
Select thePrompt Shieldspanel.
Select a sample text on the page, or input your own content for testing.
SelectRun test.
The service returns the risk flag and type for each sample.
For more information, see thePrompt Shields conceptual guide.

Prerequisites
An Azure subscription -Create one for free
Once you have your Azure subscription,create a Content Safety resourcein the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select your subscription, and select a resource group, supported region (seeRegion availability), and supported pricing tier. Then selectCreate.The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, Selectgo to resource. In the left pane, underResource Management, selectSubscription Key and Endpoint. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.

Analyze prompt attacks
This section walks through a sample request with cURL. Paste the command below into a text editor, and make the following changes.
Replace<endpoint>with the endpoint URL associated with your resource.
<endpoint>
Replace<your_subscription_key>with one of the keys for your resource.
<your_subscription_key>
Optionally, replace the"userPrompt"or"documents"fields in the body with your own text you'd like to analyze.
"userPrompt"
"documents"

The following fields must be included in the URL:
<endpoint>/contentsafety/text:shieldPrompt?api-version=2024-09-01
The parameters in the request body are defined in this table:
Open a command prompt and run the cURL command.
Interpret the API response
After you submit your request, you'll receive JSON data reflecting the analysis performed by Prompt Shields. This data flags potential vulnerabilities within your input. Hereâs what a typical output looks like:
{
  "userPromptAnalysis": {
    "attackDetected": true
  },
  "documentsAnalysis": [
    {
      "attackDetected": true
    }
  ]
}
{
  "userPromptAnalysis": {
    "attackDetected": true
  },
  "documentsAnalysis": [
    {
      "attackDetected": true
    }
  ]
}
The JSON fields in the output are defined here:
A value oftrueforattackDetectedsignifies a detected threat, in which case we recommend review and action to ensure content safety.

Clean up resources
If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
