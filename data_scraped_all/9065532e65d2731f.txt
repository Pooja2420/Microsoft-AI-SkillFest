Azure offers a host of solutions to monitor your networking assets. Azure has solutions and utilities to monitor network connectivity, the health of ExpressRoute circuits, and analyze network traffic in the cloud.
Important
As of July 1, 2021, you can no longer add new tests in an existing workspace or enable a new workspace in Network Performance Monitor (NPM). You're also no longer able to add new connection monitors in Connection Monitor (Classic). You can continue to use the tests and connection monitors that you've created prior to July 1, 2021.
To minimize service disruption to your current workloads,migrate your tests from Network Performance Monitor, ormigrate from Connection Monitor (Classic)to the new Connection Monitor in Azure Network Watcher before February 29, 2024.
Network Performance Monitor
Network Performance Monitor is a suite of capabilities that is geared towards monitoring the health of your network. Network Performance Monitor monitors network connectivity to your applications, and provides insights into the performance of your network. Network Performance Monitor is cloud-based and provides a hybrid network monitoring solution that monitors connectivity between:
Cloud deployments and on-premises locations

Performance Monitor, ExpressRoute Monitor, and Service Connectivity Monitor are monitoring capabilities within Network Performance Monitor and are described in the following sections.
Performance Monitor
Performance Monitor is part of Network Performance Monitor and is network monitoring for cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments. You can monitor network connectivity across remote branch and field offices, store locations, data centers, and clouds. You can detect network issues before your users complain. The key advantages are:
Monitor loss and latency across various subnets and set alerts
