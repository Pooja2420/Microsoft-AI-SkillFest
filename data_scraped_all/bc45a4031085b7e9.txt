The sections in this article discuss the resources and settings of Azure DDoS Protection.
Tiers
Azure DDoS Protection supports two tier types, DDoS IP Protection and DDoS Network Protection. The tier is configured in the Azure portal during the workflow when you configure Azure DDoS Protection.
The following table shows features and corresponding tiers.
Note
At no additional cost, Azure DDoS infrastructure protection protects every Azure service that uses public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This DDoS protection service helps to protect all Azure services, including platform as a service (PaaS) services such as Azure DNS. For more information on supported PaaS services, seeDDoS Protection reference architectures. Azure DDoS infrastructure protection requires no user configuration or application changes. Azure provides continuous protection against DDoS attacks. DDoS protection doesn't store customer data.
Limitations
DDoS Network Protection and DDoS IP Protection have the following limitations:
PaaS services (multitenant), which includes Azure App Service Environment for Power Apps, Azure API Management in deployment modes other than APIM with virtual network integration, and Azure Virtual WAN aren't currently supported. For more information, seeAzure DDoS Protection APIM in VNET Integration
Protecting a public IP resource attached to a NAT Gateway isn't supported.
Virtual machines in Classic/RDFE deployments aren't supported.
VPN gateway or Virtual network gateway is protected by a DDoS policy. Adaptive tuning isn't supported at this stage.
Protection of a public IP address prefix linked to a public load balancer frontend is supported with the Azure DDoS Network Protection SKU.
DDoS telemetry for individual virtual machine instances in Virtual Machine Scale Sets is available with Flexible orchestration mode.
DDoS IP Protection is similar to Network Protection, but has the following additional limitation:
Public IP Basic tier protection isn't supported.
Note
Scenarios in which a single VM is running behind a public IP is supported, but not recommended. For more information, seeFundamental best practices.
For more information, seeAzure DDoS Protection reference architectures.
