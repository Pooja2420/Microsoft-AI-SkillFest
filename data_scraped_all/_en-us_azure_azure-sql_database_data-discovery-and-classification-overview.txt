Data Discovery & Classification is built into Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics. It provides basic capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases.
Your most sensitive data might include business, financial, healthcare, or personal information. It can serve as infrastructure for:
Helping to meet standards for data privacy and requirements for regulatory compliance.
Various security scenarios, such as monitoring (auditing) access to sensitive data.
Controlling access to and hardening the security of databases that contain highly sensitive data.
Note
For information about SQL Server on-premises, seeSQL Data Discovery & Classification.
Tip
Label-based access protection using Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies is now in preview. For more information, seeEnabling access control for sensitive data using Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies (public preview).
What is Data Discovery & Classification?
Data Discovery & Classification currently supports the following capabilities:
Discovery and recommendations:The classification engine scans your database and identifies columns that contain potentially sensitive data. It then provides you with an easy way to review and apply recommended classification via the Azure portal.

Discover, classify, and label sensitive columns
This section describes the steps for:
Discovering, classifying, and labeling columns that contain sensitive data in your database.
Viewing the current classification state of your database and exporting reports.
The classification includes two metadata attributes:
Labels: The main classification attributes, used to define the sensitivity level of the data stored in the column.
Information types: Attributes that provide more granular information about the type of data stored in the column.
Information Protection policy
Azure SQL offers both SQL Information Protection policy and Microsoft Information Protection policy in data classification, and you can choose either of these two policies based on your requirement.

SQL Information Protection policy
Data Discovery & Classification comes with a built-in set of sensitivity labels and information types with discovery logic which is native to the SQL logical server. You can continue using the protection labels available in the default policy file, or you can customize this taxonomy. You can define a set and ranking of classification constructs specifically for your environment.
Define and customize your classification taxonomy
You define and customize of your classification taxonomy in one central place for your entire Azure organization. That location is inMicrosoft Defender for Cloud, as part of your security policy. Only someone with administrative rights on the organization's root management group can do this task.
As part of policy management, you can define custom labels, rank them, and associate them with a selected set of information types. You can also add your own custom information types and configure them with string patterns. The patterns are added to the discovery logic for identifying this type of data in your databases.
For more information, seeCustomize the SQL information protection policy in Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Preview).
After the organization-wide policy has been defined, you can continue classifying individual databases by using your customized policy.

Microsoft Purview Information Protection policy
Note
Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) has been rebranded as Microsoft Purview Information Protection. Both "MIP" and "Microsoft Purview Information Protection" are used interchangeably in this document, but refer to the same concept.
Microsoft Purview Information Protection labels provide a simple and uniform way for users to classify sensitive data uniformly across different Microsoft applications. MIP sensitivity labels are created and managed in theMicrosoft Purview compliance portal. To learn how to create and publish MIP sensitive labels in Microsoft Purview compliance portal, seeCreate and publish sensitivity labels.
Setting/changing information protection policy in Azure SQL Database sets the respective information protection policy for all databases under the tenant. The user or persona must have tenant wideSecurity Adminpermission to change the information protection policy from SQL Information Protection policy to MIP policy, or vice versa.
The user or persona having tenant wideSecurity Adminpermission can apply policy at the tenant root management group level. For more information, seeGrant tenant-wide permissions to yourself.
Your tenant has an active Microsoft 365 subscription and you have labels published for the current user. For more information, seeCreate and configure sensitivity labels and their policies.

A warning icon may appear against an already classified column if the column was classified using a different Information Protection policy than the currently active policy. For example, if the column was classified with a label using SQL Information Protection policy earlier and now you are in Microsoft Information Protection policy mode. you'll see a warning icon against that specific column. This warning icon doesn't indicate any problem, but is used only for information purposes.

Enabling access control for sensitive data using Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies (public preview)
Azure SQL Database supports the ability to enforce access control on the columns with sensitive data that have been labeled using Microsoft Purview Information Protection (MIP) sensitivity labels using Microsoft Purview Information Protection access policies.
Access policies in Purview enable organizations to protect sensitive data across their data sources. They enable personas like enterprise security/compliance admins to configure and enforce access control actions on sensitive data in their databases, ensuring that sensitive data can't be accessed by unauthorized users for a particular sensitivity label. Purview access policies are enforced at column level granularity for Azure SQL database, thus protecting sensitive data without blocking access to non-sensitive data columns in the database tables.
To configure and enforce Purview access policies, the user is required to have a valid Microsoft 365 license, and the database must be registered in the Purview Data Map and scanned, so that MIP sensitivity labels get assigned by Purview to the database columns containing sensitive data. Once sensitivity labels are assigned, the user can configure Purview access policies to enforcedenyactions on database columns with a specific sensitivity label, restricting access to sensitive data in those columns to only an allowed user or group of users.
Follow the list of steps below to configure and use Purview access policies for Azure SQL Database:
Make sure you have the requiredlicense prerequisites for Microsoft 365 and Purview.
Set up roles and permissions for your users.
Create or extend sensitivity labels in Purview to Azure SQL Database. Also ensure that you publish the sensitivity labels to the required users in your organization.
Registerandscanyour Azure SQL database to apply sensitivity labels automatically.
Create and configureaccess control policy in Purview for Azure SQL Database.
Once the access policy has been configured and published in Purview, any attempt by an unauthorized user to run a T-SQL query to access columns in a SQL database with sensitivity label scoped to the policy will fail. If the same query doesn't include sensitive columns, the query would succeed.
When creating a database geo-replica or copy, sensitivity labels assigned to columns in the primary database don't automatically flow to the new/secondary database, and Purview access control policies won't automatically apply to the new/secondary database. To enable access control on the new/secondary database, register and scan it separately in Purview. Then configure any access policies to also include the new/secondary database.
Audit access to sensitive data
An important aspect of the classification is the ability to monitor access to sensitive data.Azure SQL Auditinghas been enhanced to include a new field in the audit log calleddata_sensitivity_information. This field logs the sensitivity classifications (labels) of the data that was returned by a query. Here's an example:
data_sensitivity_information

These are the activities that are actually auditable with sensitivity information:
ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN
BULK INSERT
SELECT
DELETE
INSERT
MERGE
UPDATE
UPDATETEXT
WRITETEXT
DROP TABLE
BACKUP
DBCC CloneDatabase
SELECT INTO
INSERT INTO EXEC
TRUNCATE TABLE
DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS
sys.dm_db_stats_histogram
Usesys.fn_get_audit_fileto return information from an audit file stored in an Azure Storage account.
Permissions
These built-in roles can read the data classification of a database:
Owner
Reader
Contributor
SQL Security Manager
User Access Administrator
These are the required actions to read the data classification of a database are:
Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/currentSensitivityLabels/*
Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/recommendedSensitivityLabels/*
Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/schemas/tables/columns/sensitivityLabels/*
These built-in roles can modify the data classification of a database:

Note
The Azure SQL built-in roles in this section apply to a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) but are not available for dedicated SQL pools and other SQL resources within Azure Synapse workspaces. For SQL resources in Azure Synapse workspaces, use the available actions for data classification to create custom Azure roles as needed for labelling. For more information on theMicrosoft.Synapse/workspaces/sqlPoolsprovider operations, seeMicrosoft.Synapse.
Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/sqlPools
Manage classifications
You can use T-SQL, a REST API, or PowerShell to manage classifications.
Use T-SQL
You can use T-SQL to add or remove column classifications, and to retrieve all classifications for the entire database.
Note
When you use T-SQL to manage labels, there's no validation that labels that you add to a column exist in the organization's information-protection policy (the set of labels that appear in the portal recommendations). So, it's up to you to validate this.
For information about using T-SQL for classifications, see the following references:
To add or update the classification of one or more columns:ADD SENSITIVITY CLASSIFICATION
To remove the classification from one or more columns:DROP SENSITIVITY CLASSIFICATION
To view all classifications on the database:sys.sensitivity_classifications
Use PowerShell cmdlets
Manage classifications and recommendations for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance using PowerShell.

You can use the REST API to programmatically manage classifications and recommendations. The published REST API supports the following operations:
Create Or Update: Creates or updates the sensitivity label of the specified column.
Delete: Deletes the sensitivity label of the specified column.
Disable Recommendation: Disables sensitivity recommendations on the specified column.
Enable Recommendation: Enables sensitivity recommendations on the specified column. (Recommendations are enabled by default on all columns.)
Get: Gets the sensitivity label of the specified column.
