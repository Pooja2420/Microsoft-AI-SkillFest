In this article
In this tutorial, you learn how to train a classification model with no-code automated machine learning (AutoML) using Azure Machine Learning in the Azure Machine Learning studio. This classification model predicts whether a client subscribes to a fixed term deposit with a financial institution.
With Automated ML, you can automate away time intensive tasks. Automated machine learning rapidly iterates over many combinations of algorithms and hyperparameters to help you find the best model based on a success metric of your choosing.
You don't write any code in this tutorial. You use the studio interface to perform training. You learn how to do the following tasks:
Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
Run an automated machine learning experiment
Explore model details
Deploy the recommended model
Prerequisites

Important
Preparation takes10-15 minutesto prepare the experiment run. Once running, it takes2-3 minutes more for each iteration.
In production, you'd likely walk away for a bit. But for this tutorial, you can start exploring the tested algorithms on theModelstab as they complete while the others continue to run.
Explore models
Navigate to theModels + child jobstab to see the algorithms (models) tested. By default, the job orders the models by metric score as they complete. For this tutorial, the model that scores the highest based on the chosenAUCWeightedmetric is at the top of the list.
While you wait for all of the experiment models to finish, select theAlgorithm nameof a completed model to explore its performance details. Select theOverviewand theMetricstabs for information about the job.
The following animation views the selected model's properties, metrics, and performance charts.

View model explanations
While you wait for the models to complete, you can also take a look at model explanations and see which data features (raw or engineered) influenced a particular model's predictions.
These model explanations can be generated on demand. The model explanations dashboard that's part of theExplanations (preview)tab summarizes these explanations.
To generate model explanations:

Deploy the best model
The automated machine learning interface allows you to deploy the best model as a web service.Deploymentis the integration of the model so it can predict on new data and identify potential areas of opportunity. For this experiment, deployment to a web service means that the financial institution now has an iterative and scalable web solution for identifying potential fixed term deposit customers.
Check to see whether your experiment run is complete. To do so, navigate back to the parent job page by selecting the job name at the top of your screen. ACompletedstatus is shown on the top left of the screen.
After the experiment run is complete, theDetailspage is populated with aBest model summarysection. In this experiment context,VotingEnsembleis considered the best model, based on theAUCWeightedmetric.
Deploy this model. Deployment takes about 20 minutes to complete. The deployment process entails several steps including registering the model, generating resources, and configuring them for the web service.

Clean up resources
Deployment files are larger than data and experiment files, so they cost more to store. If you want to keep your workspace and experiment files, delete only the deployment files to minimize costs to your account. If you don't plan to use any of the files, delete the entire resource group.
Delete the deployment instance
Delete just the deployment instance from Azure Machine Learning at https://ml.azure.com/.
Go toAzure Machine Learning. Navigate to your workspace and under theAssetspane, selectEndpoints.
