Azure IoT Hub is a managed cloud-based service that serves as a central message hub for communication between an IoT application and its connected devices. You can reliably connect almost any device and its back-end solutions to an IoT hub at scale.
This article assumes that as an architect, you've reviewed thetechnologies and services that you can use to create IoT solutionsand choseIoT Hubas the Azure IoT platform service for your workload. The guidance in this article provides architectural recommendations that are mapped to the principles of theWell-Architected Framework pillars.

How to use this guide
Each section has adesign checklistthat presents architectural areas of concern along with design strategies localized to the technology scope.
Also included are recommendations for the technology capabilities that can help materialize those strategies. The recommendations don't represent an exhaustive list of all configurations that are available for IoT Hub and its dependencies. Instead, they list the key recommendations mapped to the design perspectives. Use the recommendations to build your proof-of-concept or to optimize your existing environments.

Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is aboutmaintaining user experience even when there's an increase in loadby managing capacity. The strategy includes scaling resources, identifying and optimizing potential bottlenecks, and optimizing for peak performance.
ThePerformance Efficiency design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those capacity goals against the expected usage.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Performance Efficiencyfor defining a baseline based on key performance indicators for IoT Hub.
Design for horizontal scaling.An IoT solution can start with a few hundred devices or messages and grow to millions of devices and messages per minute. IoT Hub and related cloud services can easily handle increased loads, but IoT devices and gateways add complexity. You can design and deploy IoT devices before you finalize the solution. Industries like industrial IoT have devices that last several years, often decades. Replacing devices to update capacity can incur significant costs, so you must plan ahead.

Recommendations
Azure policies
Azure provides an extensive set of built-in policies related to IoT Hub and its dependencies. Some of the preceding recommendations can be audited through Azure Policy. For example, you can check whether:
IoT Hub has local authentication methods disabled for service APIs.
Public network access is disabled for your IoT Hub device provisioning instance so that it's not accessible over the public internet.
IoT Hub can only be accessed from a private endpoint.
Resource logs in IoT Hub are enabled. These logs recreate activity trails that can help you investigate after a security incident or network compromise.
For comprehensive governance, review theAzure Policy built-in definitions for Internet of Thingsand other policies that might affect the security of the IoT solution.
