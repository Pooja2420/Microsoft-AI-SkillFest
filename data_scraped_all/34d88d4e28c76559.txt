Support for Generation 2 virtual machines (VMs) is now available on Azure. You can't change a virtual machine's generation after you've created it, so review the considerations on this page before you choose a generation.
Generation 2 VMs support key features that aren't supported in Generation 1 VMs. These features include increased memory, Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), and virtualized persistent memory (vPMEM). Generation 2 VMs running on-premises, have some features that aren't supported in Azure yet. For more information, see theFeatures and capabilitiessection.
Generation 2 VMs use the new UEFI-based boot architecture rather than the BIOS-based architecture used by Generation 1 VMs. Compared to Generation 1 VMs, Generation 2 VMs might have improved boot and installation times. For an overview of Generation 2 VMs and some of the differences between Generation 1 and Generation 2, seeShould I create a Generation 1 or 2 virtual machine in Hyper-V?.
Generation 2 VM sizes
Azure now offers Generation 2 support for the following selected VM series:
1Mv2-series, DC-series, NDv2-series, Msv2 and Mdsv2-series Medium Memory do not support Generation 1 VM images and only support a subset of Generation 2 images. Please seeMv2-series documentation,DSv2-series,ND A100 v4-series,NDv2-series, andMsv2 and Mdsv2 Medium Memory Seriesfor details.

On-premises vs. Azure Generation 2 VMs
Azure doesn't currently support some of the features that on-premises Hyper-V supports for Generation 2 VMs.
For more information, seeTrusted launch.

Creating a Generation 2 VM
Azure Resource Manager Template
To create a simple Windows Generation 2 VM, seeCreate a Windows virtual machine from a Resource Manager templateTo create a simple Linux Generation 2 VM, seeHow to create a Linux virtual machine with Azure Resource Manager templates
Marketplace image
In the Azure portal or Azure CLI, you can create Generation 2 VMs from a Marketplace image that supports UEFI boot.
Below are the steps to create a Generation 2 (Gen2) VM in Azure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forVirtual Machines
UnderServices, selectVirtual machines.
In theVirtual machinespage, selectAdd, and then selectVirtual machine.
UnderProject details, make sure the correct subscription is selected.
UnderResource group, selectCreate newand type a name for your resource group or select an existing resource group from the dropdown.
UnderInstance details, type a name for the virtual machine name and choose a region
UnderImage, select a Generation 2 image from theMarketplace images to get startedTipIf you don't see the Generation 2 version of the image you want in the drop-down, selectSee all imagesand then change theImage Typefilter toGen 2.
Tip
If you don't see the Generation 2 version of the image you want in the drop-down, selectSee all imagesand then change theImage Typefilter toGen 2.
Select a VM size that supports Generation 2. See a list ofsupported sizes.
Fill in theAdministrator accountinformation and thenInbound port rules
At the bottom of the page, selectReview + Create
On theCreate a virtual machinepage, you can see the details about the VM you are about to deploy. Once validation shows as passed, selectCreate.
You can also use PowerShell to create a VM by directly referencing the Generation 1 or Generation 2 SKU.
For example, use the following PowerShell cmdlet to get a list of the SKUs in theWindowsServeroffer.
WindowsServer
Get-AzVMImageSku -Location westus2 -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer
Get-AzVMImageSku -Location westus2 -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer
If you're creating a VM with Windows Server 2019 as the OS, then you can select a Generation 2 (UEFI) image which looks like this:
2019-datacenter-gensecond
2019-datacenter-gensecond
If you're creating a VM with Windows 10 as the OS, then you can select a Generation 2 (UEFI) image which looks like this:
20H2-PRO-G2
20H2-PRO-G2
See theFeatures and capabilitiessection for a current list of supported Marketplace images.
Alternatively, you can use the Azure CLI to see any available Generation 2 images, listed byPublisher.
az vm image list --publisher Canonical --sku gen2 --output table --all
az vm image list --publisher Canonical --sku gen2 --output table --all
Managed image or managed disk
You can create a Generation 2 VM from a managed image or managed disk in the same way you would create a Generation 1 VM.
Virtual machine scale sets
You can also create Generation 2 VMs by using virtual machine scale sets. In the Azure CLI, use Azure scale sets to create Generation 2 VMs.
Frequently asked questions
Are Generation 2 VMs available in all Azure regions?Yes. But not allgeneration 2 VM sizesare available in every region. The availability of the Generation 2 VM depends on the availability of the VM size.

Is there a price difference between Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs?No.
Is there a price difference between Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs?No.
I have a .vhd file from my on-premises Generation 2 VM. Can I use that .vhd file to create a Generation 2 VM in Azure?Yes, you can bring your Generation 2 .vhd file to Azure and use that to create a Generation 2 VM. Use the following steps to do so:Upload the .vhd to a storage account in the same region where you'd like to create your VM.Create a managed disk from the .vhd file. Set the Hyper-V Generation property to V2. The following PowerShell commands set Hyper-V Generation property when creating managed disk.$sourceUri = 'https://xyzstorage.blob.core.windows.net/vhd/abcd.vhd'. #<Provide location to your uploaded .vhd file>
$osDiskName = 'gen2Diskfrmgenvhd'  #<Provide a name for your disk>
$diskconfig = New-AzDiskConfig -Location '<location>' -DiskSizeGB 127 -AccountType Standard_LRS -OsType Windows -HyperVGeneration "V2" -SourceUri $sourceUri -CreateOption 'Import'
New-AzDisk -DiskName $osDiskName -ResourceGroupName '<Your Resource Group>' -Disk $diskconfigOnce the disk is available, create a VM by attaching this disk. The VM created will be a Generation 2 VM.
When the Generation 2 VM is created, you can optionally generalize the image of this VM. By generalizing the image, you can use it to create multiple VMs.

How do I increase the OS disk size?OS disks larger than 2 TiB are new to Generation 2 VMs. By default, OS disks are smaller than 2 TiB for Generation 2 VMs. You can increase the disk size up to a recommended maximum of 4 TiB. Use the Azure CLI or the Azure portal to increase the OS disk size. For information about how to expand disks programmatically, seeResize a diskforWindowsorLinux.To increase the OS disk size from the Azure portal:In the Azure portal, go to the VM properties page.To shut down and deallocate the VM, select theStopbutton.In theDiskssection, select the OS disk you want to increase.In theDiskssection, selectConfiguration, and update theSizeto the value you want.Go back to the VM properties page andStartthe VM.You might see a warning for OS disks larger than 2 TiB. The warning doesn't apply to Generation 2 VMs. However, OS disk sizes larger than 4 TiB are not supported.
