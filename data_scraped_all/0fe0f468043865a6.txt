In this article, learn how to cleanly remove your VMware vCenter environment from Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere. For VMware vSphere environments that you no longer want to manage with Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere, use the information in this article to perform the following actions:
Remove guest management from VMware virtual machines (VMs).
Remove VMware vSphere resource from Azure Arc.
Remove Arc resource bridge related items in your vCenter.
Remove guest management from VMware VMs
To prevent continued billing of Azure management services, after you remove the vSphere environment from Azure Arc, you must first remove guest management from all Arc-enabled Azure VMware Solution VMs where it was enabled.
When you enable guest management on Arc-enabled Azure VMware Solution VMs, the Arc connected machine agent is installed on them. Once guest management is enabled, you can install VM extensions on them and use Azure management services like the Log Analytics on them.
To completely remove guest management, use the following steps to remove any VM extensions from the virtual machine, disconnect the agent, and uninstall the software from your virtual machine. It's important to complete each of the three steps to fully remove all related software components from your virtual machines.
Remove VM extensions
Use the following steps to uninstall extensions from the portal.
Note
Steps 2-5must be performed for all the VMs that have VM extensions installed.
Sign in to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
SelectVirtual machinesinPrivate cloud, found in the left navigation under âvCenter Server Inventory Page".
Search and select the virtual machine where you haveGuest managementenabled.
SelectExtensions.
Select the extensions and selectUninstall.
Disable guest management from Azure Arc
To avoid problems onboarding the same VM toGuest management, we recommend you do the following steps to cleanly disable guest management capabilities.
Note
Steps 2-3must be performed forall VMsthat haveGuest managementenabled.
Sign into the virtual machine using administrator or root credentials and run the following command in the shell.azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only.
azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only.
azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only
Uninstall theConnectedMachine agentfrom the machine.

Uninstall agents from Virtual Machines (VMs)
Windows VM uninstall
To uninstall the Windows agent from the machine, use the following steps:
Sign in to the computer with an account that has administrator permissions.
InControl Panel, selectPrograms and Features.
InPrograms and Features, selectAzure Connected machine Agent, selectUninstall, then selectYes.
Delete theC:\Program Files\AzureConnectedMachineAgentfolder.
C:\Program Files\AzureConnectedMachineAgent
Linux VM uninstall
To uninstall the Linux agent, the command to use depends on the Linux operating system. You must haverootaccess permissions or your account must have elevated rights using sudo.
root
For Ubuntu, run the following command:sudo apt purge azcmagent
For Ubuntu, run the following command:
sudo apt purge azcmagent
sudo apt purge azcmagent
For RHEL and Oracle Linux run the following command:sudo yum remove azcmagent
For RHEL and Oracle Linux run the following command:
sudo yum remove azcmagent
sudo yum remove azcmagent
For SLES, run the following command:sudo zypper remove azcmagent
For SLES, run the following command:
sudo zypper remove azcmagent
sudo zypper remove azcmagent
Remove VMware vSphere resources from Azure
When you activate Arc-enabled Azure VMware Solution resources in Azure, a representation is created for them in Azure. Before you can delete the vCenter Server resource in Azure, you need to delete all of the Azure resource representations you created for your vSphere resources. To delete the Azure resource representations you created, do the following steps:
Go to the Azure portal.
ChooseVirtual machinesfrom Arc-enabled VMware vSphere resources in the private cloud.
Select all the VMs that have an Azure Enabled value asYes.
SelectRemove from Azure. This step starts deployment and removes these resources from Azure. The resources remain in your vCenter Server.Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 forResourcespools/clusters/hosts,Templates,Networks, andDatastores.
Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 forResourcespools/clusters/hosts,Templates,Networks, andDatastores.
When the deletion completes, selectOverview.Note the Custom location and the Azure Arc Resource bridge resources in the Essentials section.
Note the Custom location and the Azure Arc Resource bridge resources in the Essentials section.
SelectRemove from Azureto remove the vCenter Server resource from Azure.
Go to vCenter Server resource in Azure and delete it.
Go to the Custom location resource and selectDelete.
Go to the Azure Arc Resource bridge resources and selectDelete.
At this point, all of your Arc-enabled VMware vSphere resources are removed from Azure.
Remove Arc resource bridge related items in your vCenter
During onboarding, to create a connection between your VMware vCenter and Azure, an Azure Arc resource bridge is deployed into your VMware vSphere environment. As the last step, you must delete the resource bridge VM as well the VM template created during the onboarding.
As a last step, run the following command:
az rest --method delete --"https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/%3Csubscrption-id%3E/resourcegroups/%3Cresource-group-name%3E/providers/Microsoft.AVS/privateClouds/%3Cprivate-cloud-name%3E/addons/arc?api-version=2022-05-01%22"
az rest --method delete --"https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/%3Csubscrption-id%3E/resourcegroups/%3Cresource-group-name%3E/providers/Microsoft.AVS/privateClouds/%3Cprivate-cloud-name%3E/addons/arc?api-version=2022-05-01%22"
Once that step is done, Arc no longer works on the Azure VMware Solution private cloud. When you delete Arc resources from vCenter Server, it doesn't affect the Azure VMware Solution private cloud for the customer.
