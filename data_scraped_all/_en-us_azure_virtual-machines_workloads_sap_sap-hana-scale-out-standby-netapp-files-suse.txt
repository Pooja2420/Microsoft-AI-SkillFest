This article describes how to deploy a highly available SAP HANA system in a scale-out configuration with standby on Azure virtual machines (VMs) by usingAzure NetApp Filesfor the shared storage volumes.
In the example configurations, installation commands, and so on, the HANA instance is03and the HANA system ID isHN1. The examples are based on HANA 2.0 SP4 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP 12 SP4.
Before you begin, refer to the following SAP notes and papers:

NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA
Overview
One method for achieving HANA high availability is by configuring host auto failover. To configure host auto failover, you add one or more virtual machines to the HANA system and configure them as standby nodes. When active node fails, a standby node automatically takes over. In the presented configuration with Azure virtual machines, you achieve auto failover by usingNFS on Azure NetApp Files.
Note
The standby node needs access to all database volumes. The HANA volumes must be mounted as NFSv4 volumes. The improved file lease-based locking mechanism in the NFSv4 protocol is used forI/Ofencing.
I/O
Important
To build the supported configuration, you must deploy the HANA data and log volumes as NFSv4.1 volumes and mount them by using the NFSv4.1 protocol. The HANA host auto-failover configuration with standby node is not supported with NFSv3.

In the preceding diagram, which follows SAP HANA network recommendations, three subnets are represented within one Azure virtual network:
For client communication
For communication with the storage system
For internal HANA inter-node communication
The Azure NetApp volumes are in separate subnet,delegated to Azure NetApp Files.
For this example configuration, the subnets are:
client10.23.0.0/24
client
storage10.23.2.0/24
storage
hana10.23.3.0/24
hana
anf10.23.1.0/26

Set up the Azure NetApp Files infrastructure
Before you proceed with the set up for Azure NetApp Files infrastructure, familiarize yourself with theAzure NetApp Files documentation.
Azure NetApp Files is available in severalAzure regions. Check to see whether your selected Azure region offers Azure NetApp Files.
For information about the availability of Azure NetApp Files by Azure region, seeAzure NetApp Files Availability by Azure Region.
Important considerations
As you're creating your Azure NetApp Files for SAP NetWeaver on SUSE High Availability architecture, be aware of the important considerations documented inNFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA.
Sizing for HANA database on Azure NetApp Files
The throughput of an Azure NetApp Files volume is a function of the volume size and service level, as documented inService level for Azure NetApp Files.
As you design the infrastructure for SAP HANA on Azure with Azure NetApp Files, be aware of the recommendations inNFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA.
The configuration in this article is presented with simple Azure NetApp Files Volumes.
Important
For production systems, where performance is a key, we recommend to evaluate and consider usingAzure NetApp Files application volume group for SAP HANA.
Deploy Azure NetApp Files resources
The following instructions assume that you've already deployed yourAzure virtual network. The Azure NetApp Files resources and VMs, where the Azure NetApp Files resources will be mounted, must be deployed in the same Azure virtual network or in peered Azure virtual networks.
Create a NetApp account in your selected Azure region by following the instructions inCreate a NetApp account.
Create a NetApp account in your selected Azure region by following the instructions inCreate a NetApp account.
Set up an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool by following the instructions inSet up an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool.The HANA architecture presented in this article uses a single Azure NetApp Files capacity pool at theUltra Servicelevel. For HANA workloads on Azure, we recommend using an Azure NetApp FilesUltraorPremiumservice Level.

Deploy Azure NetApp Files volumes by following the instructions inCreate an NFS volume for Azure NetApp Files.As you're deploying the volumes, be sure to select theNFSv4.1version. Currently, access to NFSv4.1 requires being added to an allowlist. Deploy the volumes in the designated Azure NetApp Filessubnet. The IP addresses of the Azure NetApp volumes are assigned automatically.Keep in mind that the Azure NetApp Files resources and the Azure VMs must be in the same Azure virtual network or in peered Azure virtual networks. For example,HN1-data-mnt00001,HN1-log-mnt00001, and so on, are the volume names and nfs://10.23.1.5/HN1-data-mnt00001, nfs://10.23.1.4/HN1-log-mnt00001, and so on, are the file paths for the Azure NetApp Files volumes.volumeHN1-data-mnt00001 (nfs://10.23.1.5/HN1-data-mnt00001)volumeHN1-data-mnt00002 (nfs://10.23.1.6/HN1-data-mnt00002)volumeHN1-log-mnt00001 (nfs://10.23.1.4/HN1-log-mnt00001)volumeHN1-log-mnt00002 (nfs://10.23.1.6/HN1-log-mnt00002)volumeHN1-shared (nfs://10.23.1.4/HN1-shared)In this example, we used a separate Azure NetApp Files volume for each HANA data and log volume. For a more cost-optimized configuration on smaller or non-productive systems, it's possible to place all data mounts and all logs mounts on a single volume.

Important
For SAP HANA workloads, low latency is critical. To achieve low latency, work with your Microsoft representative to ensure that the virtual machines and the Azure NetApp Files volumes are deployed in close proximity. When you'reonboarding new SAP HANA systemthat's using SAP HANA Azure NetApp Files, submit the necessary information.
The next instructions assume that you've already created the resource group, the Azure virtual network, and the three Azure virtual network subnets:client,storageandhana. When you deploy the VMs, select the client subnet, so that the client network interface is the primary interface on the VMs. You will also need to configure an explicit route to the Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet via the storage subnet gateway.

Make sure that the OS you select is SAP-certified for SAP HANA on the specific VM types you're using. For a list of SAP HANA certified VM types and OS releases for those types, go to theSAP HANA certified IaaS platformssite. Click into the details of the listed VM type to get the complete list of SAP HANA-supported OS releases for that type.

The storage that's used by Azure NetApp Files has a file size limitation of 16 terabytes (TB). SAP HANA is not implicitly aware of the storage limitation, and it won't automatically create a new data file when the file size limit of 16 TB is reached. As SAP HANA attempts to grow the file beyond 16 TB, that attempt will result in errors and, eventually, in an index server crash.ImportantTo prevent SAP HANA from trying to grow data files beyond the16-TB limitof the storage subsystem, set the following parameters inglobal.ini.datavolume_striping = truedatavolume_striping_size_gb = 15000

Again, kill the name server on the currently active master node (that is, on nodehanadb3).
hn1adm@hanadb3:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> HDB kill
hn1adm@hanadb3:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> HDB kill
Nodehanadb1will resume the role of master node. After the failover test has been completed, the status will look like this:
