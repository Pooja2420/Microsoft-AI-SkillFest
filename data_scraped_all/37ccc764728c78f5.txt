Team Foundation Version Control administrators can add check-in policy requirements. These check-in policies require users to take actions when they conduct a check-in to source control. For example, a user can be required to associate a work item with a changeset. For more information about check-ins, seeDevelop code and manage pending changes.
Note
You can set Visual Studio check-in policies through Team Explorer as documented in this article, thetf.exe configure command, orthrough registry keys declared in the pkgdef of a Visual Studio extension. Policies only apply to a single installation of Visual Studio on your computer. If you have multiple installations of Visual Studio, you need to set the check-in policy on each installation.
