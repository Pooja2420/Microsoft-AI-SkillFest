This article describes how to create anAzure AI Foundryproject. A project is used to organize your work and save state while building customized AI apps.
Projects are hosted by an Azure AI Foundry hub. If your company has an administrative team that has created a hub for you, you can create a project from that hub. If you are working on your own, you can create a project and a default hub will automatically be created for you.
For more information about the projects and hubs model, seeAzure AI Foundry hubs.
Prerequisites
Use the following tabs to select the method you plan to use to create a project:

Customize the hub
Projects live inside a hub. A hub allows you to share configurations like data connections with all projects, and to centrally manage security settings and spend. If you're part of a team, hubs are shared across other team members in your subscription. For more information about the relationship between hubs and projects, see thehubs and projects overviewdocumentation.
When you create a new hub, you must haveOwnerorContributorpermissions on the selected resource group. If you're part of a team and don't have these permissions, your administrator should create a hub for you.
While you can create a hub as part of the project creation, you have more control and can set more advanced settings for the hub if you create it separately. For example, you can customize network security or the underlying Azure Storage account. For more information, seeHow to create and manage an Azure AI Foundry hub.
When you create a new hub as part of the project creation, default settings are provided. If you want to customize these settings, do so before you create the project:
In theCreate a projectform, selectCustomize.

Select an existingResource groupyou want to use, or leave the default to create a new resource group.TipEspecially for getting started it's recommended to create a new resource group for your project. This allows you to easily manage the project and all of its resources together. When you create a project, several resources are created in the resource group, including a hub, a container registry, and a storage account.

On the projectOverviewpage you can find information about the project.

Name: The name of the project appears in the top left corner. You can rename the project using the edit tool.
Subscription: The subscription that hosts the hub that hosts the project.
Resource group: The resource group that hosts the hub that hosts the project.
SelectManagement centerto navigate to the project resources in Azure AI Foundry portal.
SelectManage in Azure portalto navigate to the project resources in the Azure portal.
To manage or use the new project, include it in theMLClient:
MLClient
ml_client = MLClient(workspace_name=my_project_name, resource_group_name=resource_group, subscription_id=subscription_id,credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
ml_client = MLClient(workspace_name=my_project_name, resource_group_name=resource_group, subscription_id=subscription_id,credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
To view settings for the project, use theaz ml workspace showcommand. For example:
az ml workspace show
az ml workspace show --name {my_project_name} --resource-group {my_resource_group}
az ml workspace show --name {my_project_name} --resource-group {my_resource_group}
Access project resources
Common configurations on the hub are shared with your project, including connections, compute instances, and network access, so you can start developing right away.
In addition, a number of resources are only accessible by users in your project workspace:
Components including datasets, flows, indexes, deployed model API endpoints (open and serverless).
