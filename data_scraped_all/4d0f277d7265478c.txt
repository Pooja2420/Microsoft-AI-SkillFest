Run your manual tests and record the test results for each test step using Microsoft Test Runner.
You can run tests for both web applications and desktop apps.
Test Runner lets you run all active tests as a batch or specific test cases.
Modify tests while running them.
You can run tests for a specific build.
While testing, gather information like a screenshot or your testing actions.
If you find an issue when testing, use Test Runner to create a bug.
Include test steps, screenshots, and comments in the bug.
Note
You execute test points and not test cases.
When you add a test case to a test suite, test point(s) are generated.
A test point represents a unique combination of test case, test suite, configuration, and tester.
For example, a test case namedTest login functionality, which has two configurations for the Edge and Chrome browsers, generates two test points.
You can execute or run each of these test points.
On execution, test results are generated.
Through the test results view, or execution history, you can see all executions of a test point.
The latest execution for the test point is what you see in theExecutetab.
Supported clients and run options
In addition to running tests for a specific build, run options support various test scenarios.
To see the options, in theExecutetab, select a test, and then selectRun with options.
Select test type and runneroffers these options:

Microsoft Test Runner opens and runs in a new browser.
Start the app that you want to test.Your app doesn't have to run on the same computer as Test Runner.
You just use Test Runner to record which test steps pass or fail while you manually run a test.For example, you might run Test Runner on a desktop computer and run your store app for Windows 8 that you test on a Windows 8 tablet.

Mark each test step as either passed or failed based on the expected results.

If a test step fails, you can enter a comment on why it failed orcollect diagnostic data for the test.
You can alsoCreate or add to a bug.
Important
Any test step that has expected result is called avalidation test step. Testers must mark a test step with a status if it is a validation test step. The overall result for a test case reflects the status of all the test steps that the tester marked. Therefore, the test case will have a status of failed if the tester marked any test step as failed or not marked.
Create or add to a bug
If a test step fails, enter a comment about the behavior and collect diagnostic data.
You can create a bug to capture and track the issue.
You can also update an existing bug with information about the failure.
When a step fails, enter a comment and selectCreate bug.NoteIf the create bug button does not launch bug workitem, then verify if the teams settings are correct at Area and Iteration level as below:Go to the project settings and Team, check if the correct Team is set as default.From that Team, click on the Iterations and Area paths hyperlink near to Team name.

Frequently asked questions
Here are some common questions.
Q: How do I rerun a test?
A:Just select any test and chooseRun.
Q: Can I run all the tests in a test suite together?
A:Yes, select a test suite and chooseRun.
This option runs all the active tests in the test suite.
If you haven't run a test yet, its state is active.
You can reset the state of a test to active if you want to rerun it.

Q: Can I choose a build to run tests against?
A:Yes, ChooseRunand then selectRun with options.

Select the build you want from the drop-down list.

Any bug filed during the run will automatically be associated with the selected build.
The test outcome will be published against that build.
Note
The selected build must be from the project in which the tests are defined.
Q: Can I fix my test steps while I'm running a test?
A:Yes, if you have Azure Test Plans for Azure DevOps.
You can insert, move, or delete steps.
Or you can edit the text itself.
Use the edit icon next to the test step number.

The tool to edit the test steps is shown.

Q: Can I add a screenshot to the test results when I run a test?
A:If you're using Google Chrome or Firefox, use the web runner to take screenshots of the web app while testing.
For Microsoft Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge browsers, or for desktop app testing, you can download and use theTest Runner desktop client.

For more information, seeCollect diagnostic data.
Q: Can I capture my actions on the app as a log?
A:If you're using Google Chrome or Firefox, use the web runner capture your actions on the web app as image logs while testing.
