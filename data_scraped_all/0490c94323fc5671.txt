Azure App Services regional Virtual network integration turned off
NAT gateway can be used with Azure app services to allow applications to make outbound calls from a virtual network. To use this integration between Azure app services and NAT gateway, regional virtual network integration must be enabled. Seehow regional virtual network integration worksto learn more.
To use NAT gateway with Azure App services, follow these steps:
Ensure that your applications have virtual network integration configured, seeEnable virtual network integration.
Ensure that your applications have virtual network integration configured, seeEnable virtual network integration.
Ensure thatRoute Allis enabled for your virtual network integration, seeConfigure virtual network integration routing.

Important notes about the NAT gateway and Azure App Services integration:
Virtual network integration doesn't provide inbound private access to your app from the virtual network.

App services isn't using the NAT gateway public IP address to connect outbound
App services can still connect outbound to the internet even if virtual network integration isn't enabled. By default, apps that are hosted in App Service are accessible directly through the internet and can reach only internet-hosted endpoints. To learn more, seeApp Services Networking Features.
If you notice that the IP address used to connect outbound isn't your NAT gateway public IP address or addresses, check that virtual network integration is enabled. Ensure the NAT gateway is configured to the subnet used for integration with your applications.
To validate that web applications are using the NAT gateway public IP, ping a virtual machine on your Web Apps and check the traffic via a network capture.
Azure Kubernetes Service
How to deploy NAT gateway with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters
NAT gateway can be deployed with AKS clusters in order to allow for explicit outbound connectivity. There are two different ways to deploy NAT gateway with AKS clusters:
Managed NAT gateway: Azure deploys a NAT gateway at the time of the AKS cluster creation. AKS manages the NAT gateway.
Managed NAT gateway: Azure deploys a NAT gateway at the time of the AKS cluster creation. AKS manages the NAT gateway.
User-Assigned NAT gateway: You deploy a NAT gateway to an existing virtual network for the AKS cluster.
User-Assigned NAT gateway: You deploy a NAT gateway to an existing virtual network for the AKS cluster.
Learn more atManaged NAT Gateway.
Connecting from AKS cluster to the AKS API server over the internet
To manage an AKS cluster, the cluster interacts with its API server. When you create a non-private cluster that resolves to the API server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the API server is assigned a public IP address by default. The API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the cluster's outbound type. When the outbound cluster type is set to NAT gateway (Managed or User-Assigned), the API server traffic is processed as public traffic through the NAT gateway. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using aprivate clusteror use theAPI Server VNet Integrationfeature (in preview).
Can't update my NAT gateway IPs or idle timeout timer for an AKS cluster
Public IP addresses and the idle timeout timer for NAT gateway can be updated with theaz aks updatecommand for a managed NAT gateway ONLY.
az aks update
If you deployed a User-Assigned NAT gateway to your AKS subnets, then you can't use theaz aks updatecommand to update public IP addresses or the idle timeout timer. The user manages a User-Assigned NAT gateway. You need to update these configurations manually on your NAT gateway resource.
az aks update
Update your public IP addresses on your User-Assigned NAT gateway with the following steps:
In your resource group, select your NAT gateway resource in the portal.
In your resource group, select your NAT gateway resource in the portal.
Under Settings on the left-hand navigation bar, select Outbound IP.

Note
Increasing the TCP idle timeout timer to longer than 4 minutes can increase the risk of SNAT port exhaustion.
Azure Firewall
Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) exhaustion when connecting outbound with Azure Firewall
Azure Firewall can provide outbound internet connectivity to virtual networks. Azure Firewall provides only 2,496 SNAT ports per public IP address. While Azure Firewall can be associated with up to 250 public IP addresses to handle egress traffic, you might require fewer public IP addresses for connecting outbound. The requirement for egressing with fewer public IP addresses is due to architectural requirements and allowlist limitations by destination endpoints.
One method by which to provide greater scalability for outbound traffic and also reduce the risk of SNAT port exhaustion is to use NAT gateway in the same subnet with Azure Firewall.
For more information on how to set up a NAT gateway in an Azure Firewall subnet, seeintegrate NAT gateway with Azure Firewall. For more information about how NAT gateway works with Azure Firewall, seeScale SNAT ports with Azure NAT Gateway.
Note
NAT gateway is not supported in a vWAN architecture. NAT gateway cannot be configured to an Azure Firewall subnet in a vWAN hub.
Azure Databricks
How to use NAT gateway to connect outbound from a databricks cluster
NAT gateway can be used to connect outbound from your databricks cluster when you create your Databricks workspace. NAT gateway can be deployed to your databricks cluster in one of two ways:
When you enableSecure Cluster Connectivity (No Public IP)on the default virtual network that Azure Databricks creates, Azure Databricks automatically deploys a NAT gateway to connect outbound from your workspace's subnets to the internet. Azure Databricks creates this NAT gateway resource within the managed resource group and you can't modify this resource group or any other resources deployed in it.

Azure Databricks creates this NAT gateway resource within the managed resource group and you can't modify this resource group or any other resources deployed in it.
After you deploy Azure Databricks workspace in your own virtual network (viavirtual network injection), you can deploy and configure NAT gateway to both of your workspaceâs subnets to ensure outbound connectivity through the NAT gateway. You can implement this solution using anAzure templateor in the portal.
