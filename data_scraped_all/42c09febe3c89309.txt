If you use enterprise proxies to manage outbound traffic, the Azure Arc gateway lets you onboard infrastructure to Azure Arc using only seven (7) endpoints. With Azure Arc gateway, you can:
Connect to Azure Arc by opening public network access to only seven fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
View and audit all traffic an Azure Connected Machine agent sends to Azure via the Arc gateway.
This article explains how to set up and use Arc gateway (Public Preview).
Important
The Arc gateway feature for Azure Arc-enabled servers is currently in Public Preview in all regions where Azure Arc-enabled servers is present. See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, Public Preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
How the Azure Arc gateway works
Azure Arc gateway consists of two main components:
The Arc gateway resource:An Azure resource that serves as a common front-end for Azure traffic. This gateway resource is served on a specific domain. Once the Arc gateway resource is created, the domain is returned to you in the success response.

The Arc Proxy:A new component added to Arc agentry. This component runs as a service called "Azure Arc Proxy" and acts as a forward proxy used by the Azure Arc agents and extensions. No configuration is required on your part for the Arc Proxy. This Proxy is part of Arc core agentry and runs within the context of an Arc-enabled resource.

When the gateway is in place, traffic flows via the following hops:Arc agentry â Arc Proxy â Enterprise proxy â Arc gateway  â Target service

Current limitations
During the public preview, the following limitations apply. Consider these factors when planning your configuration.
TLS Terminating Proxies aren't supported (Public Preview)
ExpressRoute/Site-to-Site VPN or private endpoints used with the Arc gateway (Public Preview) isn't supported.
There's a limit of five (5) Arc gateway (Public Preview) resources per Azure subscription.
The Arc gateway can only be used for connectivity in the Azure public cloud.
Required permissions
To create Arc gateway resources and manage their association with Arc-enabled servers, the following permissions are required:
Microsoft.HybridCompute/settings/write
Microsoft.hybridcompute/gateways/read
Microsoft.hybridcompute/gateways/write
How to use the Arc gateway (Public Preview)
There are four steps to use the Arc gateway:
Create an Arc gateway resource.
Ensure the required URLs are allowed in your environment.
Onboard Azure Arc resources with your Arc gateway resource or configure existing Azure Arc resources to use Arc gateway.
Verify that the setup succeeded.
Step 1: Create an Arc gateway resource
You can create an Arc gateway resource using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.

Add the arc gateway extension to your Azure CLI:az extension add -n arcgateway
Add the arc gateway extension to your Azure CLI:
az extension add -n arcgateway
az extension add -n arcgateway
On a machine with access to Azure, run the following commands to create your Arc gateway resource:az arcgateway create `
    --gateway-name [Your gatewayâs Name] `
    --resource-group <Your Resource Group> `
    --location [Location]The gateway creation process takes 9-10 minutes to complete.
On a machine with access to Azure, run the following commands to create your Arc gateway resource:

        -allowed-features *
The gateway creation process takes 9-10 minutes to complete.
Step 2: Ensure the required URLs are allowed in your environment
When the resource is created, the success response includes the Arc gateway URL. Ensure your Arc gateway URL and all URLs in the following table are allowed in the environment where your Arc resources live. The required URLs are:

Known issues
Be aware of these currently known issues for the Arc gateway.
Refresh needed after Azure Connected Machine agent onboarding
When using the onboarding script (or theazcmagent connectcommand) to onboard a server with the gateway resource ID specified, the resource will successfully use Arc gateway. However, due to a known bug (with a fix currently underway), the Arc-enabled server won't display as an Associated Resource in Azure portal unless the resourceâs settings are refreshed. Use the following procedure to perform this refresh:

Arc proxy refresh needed after detaching a gateway resource from the machine

Refresh needed for machines re-enabled without gateway
If an Arc-enabled machine with an Arc gateway is deleted from Azure Arc, and then Arc-enabled again without an Arc gateway, a refresh is needed to update its status in the Azure portal.
Important
This issue occurs only when the resource is Arc-enabled again using the same ARM ID as its initial enablement.
In this scenario, the machine incorrectly displays in Azure portal as a resource associated with the Arc gateway. To prevent this, if you intend to Arc-enable a machine without an Arc gateway that was previously Arc-enabled with an Arc gateway, you must update the Arc gateway association after onboarding. To do so, use the following procedure:
Portal
CLI
PowerShell
In the Azure portal, navigate to theAzure Arc | Arc gatewaypage.
In the Azure portal, navigate to theAzure Arc | Arc gatewaypage.
Select the Arc gateway resource.
Select the Arc gateway resource.

           --base-provider Microsoft.HybridCompute `
           --base-resource-type machines `

        -BaseResourceName <NameOfResource> `
        -GatewayResourceId ""
Manual gateway association required post-deletion
If an Arc gateway is deleted while a machine is still connected to it, Azure portal must be used to associate the machine with any other Arc gateway resources.
To avoid this issue, detach all Arc-enabled resources from an Arc gateway before deleting the gateway resource. If you encounter this error, use Azure portal to associate the machine with a new Arc gateway resource.
