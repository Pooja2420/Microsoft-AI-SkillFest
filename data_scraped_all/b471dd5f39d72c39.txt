In this article, learn how to use Azure Boards to plan and track your work using anAgile,Basic,Scrum, orCapability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)process. For more information, seeAbout processes and process templates.
Agile process
Basic process
Scrum process
CMMI process
The Agile process uses various work item types such as user stories, tasks, bugs, features, and epics to plan and track work. Begin by adding user stories and grouping them into features if needed. You can add tasks to a user story to track more details.
In each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through theDiscussionsection. This article describes how to add user stories and child tasks from the web portal and add details to those work items.
The Basic process offers three work item types for planning and tracking work: epics, issues, and tasks. To begin, add issues to track user stories, bugs, or feature items. For grouping, define epics. To track more details, add tasks to an issue.
In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in theDiscussionsection. This article describes how to add issues, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.
The Scrum process uses various work item types to plan and track work. Item types include product backlog items, tasks, bugs, features, and epics. Add product backlog items and group them into features if needed. Add child tasks to track more work details.
In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in theDiscussionsection. This article describes how to add product backlog items, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.
The CMMI process uses work item types such as requirements, tasks, bugs, features, and epics to plan and track work. Start by adding requirements and group them into features or epics if needed. Add child tasks to track more work details.

Field
Definition
Impact Assessment
The effect on the customer of not implementing this requirement. You might include details from the Kano model about whether this requirement is in the surprise, required, or obvious categories. You capture this information in the rich-text HTML field that corresponds to Impact Assessment.
Requirement Type(Required)

Business Objective
Feature
Functional
Interface
Operational
Quality of Service
Safety
Scenario

Triage(Required)
Indicates the type of triage decision that's pending for the work item. Use this field when the work item is in theProposedstate and specify one of the following values:Pending(default),More Info,Info Received, orTriaged.
Proposed
Blocked

Subject Matter Experts
The names of team members who are familiar with the customer area that this requirement represents.
Field descriptions
Field
Usage
Title
Enter a description of 255 characters or less. You can always modify the title later.
Assigned To
Assign the work item to the team member responsible for performing the work. Depending on the context you're working in, the drop-down menu lists only team members or contributors to the project.
Note
You can only assign work to a single user. If you need to assign work to more than one user, add a work item for each user and distinguish the work to be done by title and description. The Assigned To field only accepts user accounts that have beenadded to a project or team.
State
When the work item is created, the State defaults to the first state in the workflow. As work progresses, update it to reflect the current status.
Reason
Use the default first. Update it when you change state as need. Each State is associated with a default reason.
Area (Path)
Choose the area path associated with the product or team, or leave blank until assigned during a planning meeting. To change the dropdown list of areas, seeDefine area paths and assign to a team.
Iteration (Path)
Choose the sprint or iteration in which the work is to be completed, or leave it blank and assign it later during a planning meeting. To change the drop-down list of iterations, seeDefine iteration paths and configure team iterations.
Description
Provide enough detail to create shared understanding of scope and support estimation efforts. Focus on the user, what they want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how to develop the product. Do provide sufficient details so that your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.
Acceptance Criteria
Provide the criteria to be met before the work item can be closed. Define what "Done" means by describing the criteria for the team to use to verify whether the backlog item or bug fix is fully implemented.
Before work begins, describe the criteria for customer acceptance as clearly as possible. Have conversations between the team and customers to determine the acceptance criteria. These criteria help ensure a common understanding within the team to meet customers' expectations. Also, this information provides the basis for acceptance testing.
Priority
A subjective rating of the issue or task it relates to the business. You can specify the following values:
1: Product can't ship without the successful resolution of the work item, and it should be addressed as soon as possible.
2: Product can't ship without the successful resolution of the work item, but it doesn't need to be addressed immediately.
3: Resolution of the work item is optional, based on resources, time, and risk.
4: Resolution of the work item isn't required.
Value Area
A subjective rating of the issue or task it relates to the business. You can specify the following values:
Architectural: Technical services to implement business features that deliver solution.
Business: Services that fulfill customers or stakeholder needs that directly deliver customer value to support the business (Default).
Effort, Story Points, Size
Provide a relative estimate of the amount of work required to complete an issue. Most Agile methods recommend that you set estimates for backlog items based on relative size of work. Such methods include powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) and the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). Use any numeric unit of measurement your team prefers.The estimates you set are used to calculateteam velocityandforecast sprints.
Update work status
The State field tracks the status of a work item. With the board, you can quickly update the status of backlog items by dragging and dropping them to a different column.
Agile process
Basic process
Scrum process
CMMI process
As work begins, drag the user story card from theBacklogcolumn to theActivecolumn. When work is ready for review, move it to theResolvedcolumn. After a team member reviews and accepts it, move it to theClosedcolumn.

As work begins, drag the issue from theTo Docolumn to theDoingcolumn. When a team member completes it, move it to theDonecolumn.

After a backlog item is approved to start work, drag the backlog item card from theNewcolumn to theApprovedcolumn. When work begins, drag the card to theCommittedcolumn. After work completes, move it to theDonecolumn.

As work begins, drag the requirement card from theBacklogcolumn to theActivecolumn. When work is ready for review, move it to theResolvedcolumn. After a team member reviews and accepts it, move it to theClosedcolumn.

Tip
To add or rename columns as needed, seeAbout configuring and customizing Azure Boards.
Add tasks
Task checklists provide a quick and easy way to track elements of work that are important to complete a backlog item. Also, you can assign individual tasks to different team members.
Tip
Tasks that you create from the board are automatically assigned theArea PathandIteration Pathof their parent work item and show up on your sprint taskboard.

For on-premises Azure DevOps Server,configure an SMTP serverfor team members to receive notifications.
Add a reaction to a comment
Add one or more reactions to a comment by choosing a smiley icon at the upper-right corner of any comment. Choose from the icons at the bottom of a comment next to any existing reactions. To remove your reaction, choose the reaction on the bottom of your comment. The following image shows an example of the experience of adding a reaction, and the display of reactions on a comment.

Save a comment without saving the work item
Note
This feature is available starting in Azure DevOps Server 2022.1.
If you only have permissions to add to theDiscussionof a work item, then you can do so by saving comments. This permission is controlled by Area Path nodes and theEdit work item comments in this nodepermission. For more information, seeSet work tracking permissions, Create child nodes, modify work items under an area or iteration path.
When you save the comments, you don't need to save the work item.

Note
When you save changes made to theDiscussioncontrol, only the comment gets saved. Nowork item rulesdefined for the work item type are executed.
