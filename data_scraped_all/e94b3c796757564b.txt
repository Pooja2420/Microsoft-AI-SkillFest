To support interoperability across protocols, IoT Hub defines a common set of messaging features that are available in all device-facing protocols. These features can be used in bothdevice-to-cloud messagesandcloud-to-device messages.
Note
Some of the features mentioned in this article, like cloud-to-device messaging, device twins, and device management, are only available in the standard tier of IoT Hub. For more information about the basic and standard/free IoT Hub tiers, seeChoose the right IoT Hub tier and size for your solution.
IoT Hub implements device-to-cloud messaging using a streaming messaging pattern. IoT Hub's device-to-cloud messages are more likeEvent HubseventsthanService Busmessagesin that there's a high volume of events passing through the service that multiple readers can read.
An IoT Hub message consists of:
A predetermined set ofsystem propertiesas described later in this article.

A set ofapplication properties. A dictionary of string properties that the application can define and access, without needing to deserialize the message body. IoT Hub never modifies these properties.

Each device protocol implements setting properties in different ways. For more information, see theMQTT protocol guideandAMQP protocol guidedeveloper guides for details.
When you send device-to-cloud messages using the HTTPS protocol or send cloud-to-device messages, property names and values can only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters, plus! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~.
! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~
Device-to-cloud messaging with IoT Hub has the following characteristics:
Device-to-cloud messages are durable and retained in an IoT hub's defaultmessages/eventsendpoint for up to seven days.

Device-to-cloud messages can be at most 256 KB, and can be grouped in batches to optimize sends. Batches can be at most 256 KB.

IoT Hub doesn't allow arbitrary partitioning. Device-to-cloud messages are partitioned based on their originatingdeviceId.

Note
Each IoT Hub protocol provides a message content type property which is respected when routing data to custom endpoints.  To have your data properly handled at the destination (for example, JSON being treated as a parsable string instead of Base64 encoded binary data), provide the appropriate content type and charset for the message.
To use your message body in an IoT Hub routing query, provide a valid JSON object for the message and set the content type property of the message toapplication/json;charset=utf-8.
application/json;charset=utf-8
The following example shows a valid, routable message body:
{
    "timestamp": "2022-02-08T20:10:46Z",
    "tag_name": "spindle_speed",
    "tag_value": 100
}
{
    "timestamp": "2022-02-08T20:10:46Z",
    "tag_name": "spindle_speed",
    "tag_value": 100
}

Application properties of device-to-cloud messages
A common use of application properties is to send a timestamp from the device using theiothub-creation-time-utcproperty to record when the message was sent by the device. The format of this timestamp must be UTC with no timezone information. For example,2021-04-21T11:30:16Zis valid, but2021-04-21T11:30:16-07:00is invalid.

System property names
The system property names vary based on the endpoint to which the messages are being routed.
Message size
IoT Hub measures message size in a protocol-agnostic way, considering only the actual payload. The size in bytes is calculated as the sum of the following values:
The body size in bytes.
The size in bytes of all the values of the message system properties.
The size in bytes of all user property names and values.
Property names and values are limited to ASCII characters, so the length of the strings equals the size in bytes.
Anti-spoofing properties
To avoid device spoofing in device-to-cloud messages, IoT Hub stamps all messages with the following properties:
iothub-connection-device-id
iothub-connection-auth-generation-id
iothub-connection-auth-method
The first two contain thedeviceIdandgenerationIdof the originating device, as perDevice identity properties.
Theiothub-connection-auth-methodproperty contains a JSON serialized object, with the following properties:
{
  "scope": "{ hub | device | module }",
  "type": "{ symkey | sas | x509 }",
  "issuer": "iothub"
}
{
  "scope": "{ hub | device | module }",
  "type": "{ symkey | sas | x509 }",
  "issuer": "iothub"
}
