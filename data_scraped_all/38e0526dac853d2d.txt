When you're building a solution on Azure, you combine multiple distinct Azure services together to achieve your business and technical goals. Although Azure services work in a consistent manner, there are specific considerations for how you design and implement each service. When you design a multitenant solution, there are further considerations to review, for each service.
In this section, we provide guidance about the features of each service that are helpful for multitenant solutions. We also discuss the levels of tenant isolation that each service supports. Where applicable, we link to more details and sample implementations in the service's documentation.
