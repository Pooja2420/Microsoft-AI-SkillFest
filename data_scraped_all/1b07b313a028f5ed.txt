As of March 31, 2025, cloud Services (extended support) is deprecated and will be fully retired on March 31, 2027.Learn moreabout this deprecation andhow to migrate.
This document provides an overview for migrating Cloud Services (classic) to Cloud Services (extended support).
Cloud Services (extended support)has the primary benefit of providing regional resiliency along with feature parity with Azure Cloud Services deployed using Azure Service Manager. It also offers some Azure Resource Manager capabilities such as role-based access control (RBAC), tags, policy, and supports deployment templates, private link. Both deployment models (extended support and classic) are available withsimilar pricing structures.
Cloud Services (extended support) supports two paths for customers to migrate from Azure Service Manager to Azure Resource Manager: Redeploy and In-place Migration.
The following table highlights comparison between these two options.
When evaluating migration plans from Cloud Services (classic) to Cloud Services (extended support), you may want to investigate other Azure services such as:Virtual Machine Scale Sets,App Service,Azure Kubernetes Service, andAzure Service Fabric. These services continue to feature other capabilities, while Cloud Services (extended support) maintains feature parity with Cloud Services (classic).
Depending on the application, Cloud Services (extended support) may require substantially less effort to move to Azure Resource Manager compared to other options. If your application isn't evolving, Cloud Services (extended support) is a viable option to consider as it provides a quick migration path. Conversely, if your application is continuously evolving and needs a more modern feature set, do explore other Azure services to better address your current and future requirements.
Redeploy Overview
Redeploying your services withCloud Services (extended support)has the following benefits:
Supports web and worker roles, similar to [Cloud Services (classic).
There are no changes to the design, architecture, or components of web and worker roles.
No changes are required to runtime code as the data plane is the same as cloud services.
Azure GuestOS releases and associated updates are aligned with Cloud Services (classic).
Underlying update process with respect to update domains, how upgrade proceeds, rollback, and allowed service changes during an update remains unchanged.
A new Cloud Service (extended support) can be deployed directly in Azure Resource Manager using the following client tools:
Deploy a cloud service â Portal
Deploy a cloud service â PowerShell
Deploy a cloud service â Template
Deploy a cloud service â SDK
Deploy a cloud service â Visual Studio
Migration tool Overview
The platform supported migration provides following key benefits:
Enables seamless platform orchestrated migration with no downtime for most scenarios. Learn more aboutsupported scenarios.
Migrates existing cloud services in three simple steps: validate, prepare, commit (or abort). Learn more about how themigration tool works.
Offers testing for migrated deployments after successful preparation. Commit and finalize the migration while abort rolls back the migration.
The migration tool utilizes the same APIs and has the same experience as theVirtual Machine (classic) migration.
Set up access for migration
To perform this migration, you must be added as a coadministrator for the subscription and register the providers needed.
Sign in to the Azure portal.
Sign in to the Azure portal.
On the Hub menu, select Subscription. If you don't see it, select All services.
On the Hub menu, select Subscription. If you don't see it, select All services.
Find the appropriate subscription entry, and then look at the MY ROLE field. For a coadministrator, the value should be Account admin. If you're not able to add a coadministrator, contact a service administrator or coadministrator for the subscription to get yourself added.

How is migration for Cloud Services (classic) different from Virtual Machines (classic)?
Azure Service Manager supports two different compute products,Azure Virtual Machines (classic)andAzure Cloud Services (classic)or Web/ Worker roles. The two products differ based on the deployment type that lies within the Cloud Service. Azure Cloud Services (classic) uses Cloud Service containing deployments with Web/Worker roles. Azure Virtual Machines (classic) uses a cloud service containing deployments with IaaS VMs.
The list of supported scenarios differs between Cloud Services (classic) and Virtual Machines (classic) because of differences in the deployment types.
Migration steps
Customers can migrate their Cloud Services (classic) deployments using the same four operations used to migrate Virtual Machines (classic).
Validate Migration- Validates that common unsupported scenarios won't prevent migration.
Prepare Migrationâ Duplicates the resource metadata in Azure Resource Manager. All resources are locked for create/update/delete operations to ensure resource metadata is in sync across Azure Server Manager and Azure Resource Manager. All read operations work using both Cloud Services (classic) and Cloud Services (extended support) APIs.
Abort Migration- Removes resource metadata from Azure Resource Manager. Unlocks all resources for create/update/delete operations.
Commit Migration- Removes resource metadata from Azure Service Manager. Unlocks the resource for create/update/delete operations. Abort is no longer allowed after commit attempts.
Note
Prepare, Abort and Commit are idempotent and therefore, if failed, a retry should fix the issue.
