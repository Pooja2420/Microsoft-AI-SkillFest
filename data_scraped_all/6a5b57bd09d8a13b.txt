Azure Artifacts provides a dedicated symbols server for publishing symbols. This server allows you to connect a debugger that can automatically fetch the correct symbol files, enabling you to debug your application efficiently. With tools like WinDbg, you can load an executable, attach the debugger to a running process, consume your symbols, set up breakpoints, and systematically analyze your code.
Add symbol server to WinDbg
To use the Azure Artifacts symbol server, you must add your organization to the symbols search path, but before we can do that, we must first create a personal access token.
Create aPersonal Access TokenwithSymbols (read)scope and copy it to your clipboard.
