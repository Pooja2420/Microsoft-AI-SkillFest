Configure NFSv4.1 Kerberos encryption for Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files supports NFS client encryption in Kerberos modes (krb5, krb5i, and krb5p) with AES-256 encryption. This article describes the required configurations for using an NFSv4.1 volume with Kerberos encryption.
Requirements
The following requirements apply to NFSv4.1 client encryption:
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Microsoft Entra Domain Services connection to facilitate Kerberos ticketing
DNS A/PTR record creation for both the client and Azure NetApp Files NFS server IP addresses
A Linux client:This article provides guidance for RHEL and Ubuntu clients. Other clients also work with similar configuration steps.
NTP server access:You can use one of the commonly used Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC) domain controllers.
To leverage Domain or LDAP user authentication, ensure that NFSv4.1 volumes are enabled for LDAP. SeeConfigure ADDS LDAP with extended groups.
Ensure that User Principal Names for user accounts donotend with a$symbol (for example, user$@REALM.COM).ForGroup managed service accounts(gMSA), you need to remove the trailing$from the User Principal Name before the account can be used with the Azure NetApp Files Kerberos feature.

Create an NFS Kerberos Volume
Follow steps inCreate an NFS volume for Azure NetApp Filesto create the NFSv4.1 volume.On the Create a volume page, set the NFS version toNFSv4.1and set Kerberos toEnabled.ImportantYou can't modify the Kerberos enablement selection after the volume is created.

Important
You can't modify the Kerberos enablement selection after the volume is created.

Configure the Azure portal
Follow the instructions inCreate an Active Directory connection.Kerberos requires that you create at least one computer account in Active Directory. The account information you provide is used for creating the accounts for both SMBandNFSv4.1 Kerberos volumes. This machine account is created automatically during volume creation.

UnderKerberos Realm, enter theAD Server Nameand theKDC IPaddress.AD Server and KDC IP can be the same server. This information is used to create the SPN computer account used by Azure NetApp Files. After the computer account is created, Azure NetApp Files uses DNS Server records to locate additional KDC servers as needed.

Configure Active Directory connection
Configuration of NFSv4.1 Kerberos creates two computer accounts in Active Directory:
A computer account for SMB shares
A computer account for NFSv4.1--You can identify this account by using the prefixNFS-.
NFS-
After creating the first NFSv4.1 Kerberos volume, set the encryption type for the computer account with the PowerShell commandSet-ADComputer $NFSCOMPUTERACCOUNT -KerberosEncryptionType AES256.
Set-ADComputer $NFSCOMPUTERACCOUNT -KerberosEncryptionType AES256
