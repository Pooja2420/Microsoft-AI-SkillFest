Similar to a role assignment, adeny assignmentattaches a set of deny actions to a user, group, or service principal at a particular scope for the purpose of denying access. Deny assignments block users from performing specific Azure resource actions even if a role assignment grants them access.
This article describes how to list deny assignments.
Important
You can't directly create your own deny assignments. Deny assignments are created and managed by Azure.
How deny assignments are created
Deny assignments are created and managed by Azure to protect resources. You can't directly create your own deny assignments. However, you can specify deny settings when creating a deployment stack, which creates a deny assignment that is owned by the deployment stack resources. For more information, seeProtect managed resourcesandAzure RBAC limits.
Compare role assignments and deny assignments
Deny assignments follow a similar pattern as role assignments, but also have some differences.
Deny assignment properties
A deny assignment has the following properties:
DenyAssignmentName
Description
Permissions.Actions
Permissions.NotActions
Permissions.DataActions
Permissions.NotDataActions
Scope
DoNotApplyToChildScopes
Principals[i].Id
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Principals[i].Type

ExcludePrincipals[i].Id
ExcludePrincipals[i].Type
IsSystemProtected
The All Principals principal
To support deny assignments, a system-defined principal namedAll Principalshas been introduced. This principal represents all users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in a Microsoft Entra directory. If the principal ID is a zero GUID00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000and the principal type isSystemDefined, the principal represents all principals. In Azure PowerShell output, All Principals looks like the following:
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
SystemDefined
Principals              : {
                          DisplayName:  All Principals
                          ObjectType:   SystemDefined
                          ObjectId:     00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
                          }
Principals              : {
                          DisplayName:  All Principals
                          ObjectType:   SystemDefined
                          ObjectId:     00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
                          }
All Principals can be combined withExcludePrincipalsto deny all principals except some users. All Principals has the following constraints:

To see the properties for a deny assignment, selectProperties.On thePropertiespage, you can see the deny assignment name, ID, description, and scope. TheDoes not apply to childrenswitch indicates whether the deny assignment is inherited to subscopes. TheSystem protectedswitch indicates whether this deny assignment is managed by Azure. Currently, this isYesin all cases.
