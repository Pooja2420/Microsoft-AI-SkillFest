AnAzure role assignment conditionis an optional check that you can add to your role assignment to provide more fine-grained access control. For example, you can add a condition that requires an object to have a specific tag to read the object. This article describes how to add, edit, view, or delete conditions for your role assignments using the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
For information about the prerequisites to add or edit role assignment conditions, seeConditions prerequisites.
Step 1: Determine the condition you need
To get some ideas about conditions that could be useful to you, review the examples inExample Azure role assignment conditions for Blob Storage.
Currently, conditions can be added to built-in or custom role assignments that haveblob storage data actionsorqueue storage data actions. These include the following built-in roles:
Storage Blob Data Contributor
Storage Blob Data Owner
Storage Blob Data Reader
Storage Queue Data Contributor
Storage Queue Data Message Processor
Storage Queue Data Message Sender
Storage Queue Data Reader
Step 2: Choose how to add condition
There are two ways that you can add a condition. You can add a condition when you add a new role assignment or you can add a condition to an existing role assignment.
New role assignment
Follow the steps toAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.

Select the actions you want to allow if the condition is true.If you select multiple actions for a single condition, there might be fewer attributes to choose from for your condition because the attributes must be available across the selected actions.

In theAttribute sourcelist, select where the attribute can be found.Environmentindicates that the attribute is associated with the network environment over which the resource is accessed such as a private link, or the current date and time.Resourceindicates that the attribute is on the resource, such as container name.Requestindicates that the attribute is part of the action request, such as setting the blob index tag.Principalindicates that the attribute is a Microsoft Entra custom security attribute principal, such as a user, enterprise application (service principal), or managed identity.

In theAttributelist, select an attribute for the left side of the expression.For more information about supported attribute sources and individual attributes, seeAttributes.Depending on the attribute you select, boxes might be added to specify additional attribute details or operators. For example, some attributes supporttheExistsfunction operator, which you can use to test whether the attribute is currently associated with the resource such as an encryption scope.

Add more expressions as needed.If you add three or more expressions, you might need to group them with parentheses so the connecting logical operators are evaluated correctly. Add check marks next to the expressions you want to group and then selectGroup. To remove grouping, selectUngroup.
