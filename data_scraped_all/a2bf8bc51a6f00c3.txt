Quickstart: Create alerts with Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics
Article
2024-06-18
2 contributors
In this article
In this quickstart, you learn how you can use Azure Log Analytics to create alerts on Azure Resource Graph queries. You can create alerts with Azure Resource Graph query, Log Analytics workspace, and managed identities. The alert's conditions send notifications at a specified interval.
You can use queries to set up alerts for your deployed Azure resources. You can create queries using Azure Resource Graph tables, or you can combine Azure Resource Graph tables and Log Analytics data from Azure Monitor Logs.
In this article's examples, create resources in the same resource group and use the same region, likeWest US 3. The examples in this article run queries and create alerts for Azure resources in a single Azure tenant. Azure Data Explorer clusters are out of this article's scope.
This article includes two examples of alerts:
Azure Resource Graph: Uses the Azure Resource GraphResourcestable to create a query that gets data for your deployed Azure resources and create an alert.
Resources
Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics: Uses the Azure Resource GraphResourcestable and Log Analytics data from the from Azure Monitor LogsHeartbeattable. This example uses a virtual machine to show how to set up the query and alert.

Note
Azure Resource Graph alerts integration with Log Analytics is in public preview.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure account, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Resources deployed in Azure like virtual machines or storage accounts.
To use the example for the Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics query, you need at least one Azure virtual machine with the Azure Monitor Agent.

Create virtual machine
Azure Resource Graph
Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics
You don't need to create a virtual machine for the example that uses the Azure Resource Graph table.
Note
This section is optional if you have existing virtual machines or know how to create a virtual machine. This example uses a virtual machine to show how to create a query using an Azure Resource Graph table and Log Analytics data.
To get log information, when you connect your virtual machine to the Log Analytics workspace, the Azure Monitor Agent is installed on the virtual machine. If you don't have a virtual machine, you can create one for this example. To avoid unnecessary costs, delete the virtual machine when you're finished with the example.
The following instructions are basic settings for a Linux virtual machine. Detailed steps about how to create a virtual machine are outside the scope of this article. Your organization might require different security or networking settings for virtual machines.
In Azure, create anUbuntu Linux virtual machine.

For a new configuration, it might take 30 minutes for log information to become available and create alerts. During that time, you might notice the virtual machine's alert rule displays alerts in the workspace's monitoring alerts. When the virtual machine's log information becomes available, the alerts are displayed in the virtual machine's monitoring alerts.
Clean up resources
If you want to keep the alert configuration but stop the alert from firing and sending email notifications, you can disable it. Go to your alert ruledemo-arg-alert-ruleordemo-arg-la-alert-ruleand selectDisable.
If you don't need this alert or the resources you created in this example, delete the resource group with the following steps:
Go to your resource groupdemo-arg-alert-rg.
SelectDelete resource group.
Type the resource group name to confirm.
SelectDelete.
If you created a virtual machine, delete the private key you downloaded to your computer during the deployment. The filename has a.pemextension.
