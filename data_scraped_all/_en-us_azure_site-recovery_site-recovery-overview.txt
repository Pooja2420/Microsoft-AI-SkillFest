Welcome to the Azure Site Recovery service! This article provides a quick service overview.
As an organization, you need to adopt a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy that keeps your data safe, and your apps and workloads online, when planned and unplanned outages occur.
Azure Recovery Services contributes to your BCDR strategy:
Site Recovery service: Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recoveryreplicatesworkloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to a secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.
Backup service: TheAzure Backupservice keeps your data safe and recoverable.
Azure Site Recovery has an option ofHigh Churn, enabling you to configure disaster recovery for Azure VMs having data churn up to 100 MB/s. This helps you to enable disaster recovery for more IO intensive workloads.Learn more.
