Applies to: Azure Local 2311.2 and later
Important
The procedure described here applies when updating your existing Azure Local version to a newer version. For information on updates for older versions, seeUpdate clusters for Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2.
This article describes how to use Azure Update Manager to find and install available updates on Azure Local. It also describes how to review, track progress, and browse the history of system updates.
Important
Based on the solution you're using to run Azure Local, latest feature updates might take a week from the availability date before they're visible, due to hardware partner validation and sign-off.
About Azure Update Manager
Azure Update Manager is an Azure service that allows you to apply, view, and manage updates for each of your Azure Local machines. You can monitor your entire infrastructure, including remote and branch offices, and perform updates at scale.
Here are some benefits of the Azure Update Manager:
The update agent checks Azure Local instances for update health and available updates daily.
You can view the update status and readiness for each system.
You can update multiple systems at the same time.
You can view the status of updates while they're in progress.
You can view the results and history of updates, after they're complete.
About readiness checks
Readiness checks are essential to ensure that you apply updates smoothly, keep your systems up-to-date, and maintain correct system functionality. Readiness checks are performed and reported separately in two scenarios:
System health checks that run onceevery 24 hours.
System health checks that run onceevery 24 hours.
Update readiness checks that run after downloading the update content and before beginning the installation.
Update readiness checks that run after downloading the update content and before beginning the installation.
It is common for the results of system health checks and update readiness checks to differ. This happens because update readiness checks use the latest validation logic from the solution update to be installed, while system health checks always use validation logic from the installed version.
Both system and pre-update readiness checks perform similar validations and categorize three types of readiness checks: Critical, Warning, and Informational.
Critical: Readiness checks that prevent you from applying the update. This status indicates issues that you must resolve before proceeding with the update.
Warning: Readiness checks that also prevent you from applying the update, but you can bypass these usingPowerShell. This status indicates potential issues that might not be severe enough to stop the update but should be addressed to ensure a smooth update process.
Informational: Readiness checks that don't block the update. This status provides information about the system's state and any potential issues that shouldn't affect the update process directly. These checks are for your awareness and might not require immediate action.
Prerequisites
An Azure Local system deployed and registered with Azure.
Make sure to apply updates via supported navigation paths in Azure portal. Microsoft only supports updates applied from theAzure Localresource page or via theAzure Update Manager > Resources > Azure Local. Additionally, use of 3rd party tools to install updates is not supported.
For Azure Local, Azure Update Manager is supported only in the regions where Azure Local is supported. For more information, seeList of supported Azure Local regions.

Track system update progress and history
You can use Azure Update Manager to track the progress of Azure Local updates, regardless of the method you use to start the updates. This means you can check the progress of updates started via PowerShell, the Azure Local resource page, or Azure Update Manager.
Note
After you trigger an update, it can take up to 15 minutes for the update run to show up in the Azure portal.
To view the progress of your update installation, and completion results, follow these steps:
Sign intothe Azure portaland go toAzure Update Manager.

Install hardware updates
Hardware updates for Azure Local may be available through Azure Update Manager if your Azure Local instance has a solution builder extension.
For systems that support solution builder extensions:
Azure Update Manager automatically includes the appropriate solution builder extension updates when installing Azure Local Feature updates.
Azure Update Manager allows the installation of solution builder extension updates separately (hardware updates can be installed without a combined Azure Local update).
Azure Update Manager only supports the installation of hardware updates via solution builder extensions. If your hardware doesn't support the solution builder extension update experience, the process for updating your hardware remains similar to the process used with Azure Local, version 22H2. This means that your hardware updates may be available using Windows Admin Center.
To determine if your system supports solution builder extension and for details on installing hardware updates, seeAbout Solution Builder Extension software updates.
