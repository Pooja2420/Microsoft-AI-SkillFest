Increase VM-family vCPU quotas

Azure Resource Manager enforces two types of vCPU quotas for virtual machines:
standard vCPU quotas
spot vCPU quotas
Standard vCPU quotas apply to pay-as-you-go VMs and reserved VM instances. They're enforced at two tiers, for each subscription, in each region:
The first tier is the total regional vCPU quota.
The second tier is the VM-family vCPU quota such as D-series vCPUs.
This article shows how to request increases for VM-family vCPU quotas. You can also request increases forvCPU quotas by regionorspot vCPU quotas.
Adjustable and non-adjustable quotas
When requesting a quota increase, the steps differ depending on whether the quota is adjustable or non-adjustable.
Adjustable quotas: Quotas for which you can request quota increases fall into this category. Each subscription has a default quota value for each quota. You can request an increase for an adjustable quota from theAzure HomeMy quotaspage, providing an amount or usage percentage and submitting it directly. This is the quickest way to increase quotas.
Non-adjustable quotas: These are quotas which have a hard limit, usually determined by the scope of the subscription. To make changes, you must submit a support request, and the Azure support team will help provide solutions.
Request an increase for adjustable quotas
You can submit a request for a standard vCPU quota increase per VM-family fromMy quotas, quickly accessed fromAzure Home. You must have an Azure account with the Contributor role (or another role that includes Contributor access).

This option allows you to select one usage percentage to apply to all the selected quotas without requiring you to calculate an absolute number (limit) for each quota.

Your request will be reviewed, and you'll be notified if the request can be fulfilled. This usually happens within a few minutes. If your request isn't fulfilled, you'll see a link where you canopen a support requestso that a support engineer can assist you with the increase.
Note
If your request to increase your VM-family quota is approved, Azure will automatically increase the regional vCPU quota for the region where your VM is deployed.
Tip
When creating or resizing a virtual machine and selecting your VM size, you may see some options listed underInsufficient quota - family limit. If so, you can request a quota increase directly from the VM creation page by selecting theRequest quotalink.
Request an increase when a quota isn't available
At times you may see a message that a selected quota isnât available for an increase. To see which quotas are unavailable, look for the Information icon next to the quota name.

If a quota you want to increase isn't currently available, the quickest solution may be to consider other series or regions. If you want to continue and receive assistance for your specified quota, you can submit a support request for the increase.
When following the steps above, if a quota isn't available, select the Information icon next to the quota. Then selectCreate a support request.
