Access control for certificates is managed by Key Vault, and is provided by the Key Vault that contains those certificates. The access control policy for certificates is distinct from the access control policies for keys and secrets in the same Key Vault. Users may create one or more vaults to hold certificates, to maintain scenario appropriate segmentation and management of certificates.
The following permissions can be used, on a per-principal basis, in the secrets access control entry on a key vault, and closely mirrors the operations allowed on a secret object:
