Azure Storage supports optional anonymous read access for containers and blobs. By default, anonymous access to your data is never permitted. Unless you explicitly enable anonymous access, all requests to a container and its blobs must be authorized. We recommend that you disable anonymous access for all of your storage accounts.
This article provides an overview of how to remediate anonymous access for your storage accounts.
Warning
Anonymous access presents a security risk. We recommend that you take the actions described in the following section to remediate anonymous access for all of your storage accounts, unless your scenario specifically requires anonymous access.
Recommendations for remediating anonymous access
You can remediate anonymous access for an account at any time by setting the account'sAllowBlobPublicAccessproperty toFalse. After you set theAllowBlobPublicAccessproperty toFalse, all requests for blob data to that storage account will require authorization, regardless of the anonymous access setting for any individual container.
To learn more about how to remediate anonymous access for Azure Resource Manager accounts, seeRemediate anonymous read access to blob data.
Scenarios requiring anonymous access
If your scenario requires that certain containers need to be available for anonymous access, then you should move those containers and their blobs into separate storage accounts that are reserved only for anonymous access. You can then disallow anonymous access for any other storage accounts using the recommendations provided inRecommendations for remediating anonymous access.
For information on how to configure containers for anonymous access, seeConfigure anonymous read access for containers and blobs.
