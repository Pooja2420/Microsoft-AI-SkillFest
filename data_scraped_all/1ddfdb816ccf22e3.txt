Migrate an Oracle database to OD@A Exadata Database Service
This article describes how to use Oracle Zero Downtime Migration (ZDM) to migrate an Oracle database from an on-premises Exadata system toOracle Database@Azure(OD@A) Exadata Database Service. This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of OD@A and Oracle ZDM. This scenario builds on the scenario inMigrate Oracle database workloads to Azure.
Architecture
The following diagram shows an example of this scenario.

Scenario
Consider the following scenario details:
You deployed OD@A Exadata Database Service into your chosen Azure region and configured a virtual machine cluster that has two database servers and three storage cell nodes.
You deployed OD@A Exadata Database Service into your chosen Azure region and configured a virtual machine cluster that has two database servers and three storage cell nodes.
The OD@A delegated subnet is in the OD@A virtual network, which peers to the hub virtual network. The IP address range of the OD@A subnet is 10.42.1.0/24. For more information, seePlan for IP address space.
The OD@A delegated subnet is in the OD@A virtual network, which peers to the hub virtual network. The IP address range of the OD@A subnet is 10.42.1.0/24. For more information, seePlan for IP address space.
In the hub virtual network, the traffic has to traverse a non-Microsoft network virtual appliance (NVA), such as FortiGate, Check Point, or Cisco. The NVA functions as a routing device, which helps ensure that OD@A cluster nodes are fully routable within the infrastructure. You configure the NVA to inspect all traffic that goes to and from on-premises. The IP address of the hub NVA is 10.0.0.5.

You configure hybrid connectivity in the hub virtual network via an Azure ExpressRoute connection to your on-premises network.

In your on-premises network, you have an existing Exadata implementation, and you want to migrate one of the databases to OD@A. The database is 2 TB and runs on Exadata X8M-2. The database version is Oracle Database 19c, Enterprise Edition. Your on-premises IP address range is 192.168.0.0/16.

You enabled Real Application Clusters (RAC) on the database. For disaster recovery, you replicate the database via Oracle Data Guard to another datacenter that's geographically distant from the primary database location.

Establish network connectivity
To use ZDM for migration, you need to ensure that the source and target databases can communicate with each other.
Create an Azure route table, and associate it with the OD@A subnet.
Point the Azure route table to the IP address of the hub NVA to route to on-premises.
Configure the hub NVA to route traffic between on-premises and the OD@A subnet.
Configure the route table
Use the following configuration to create an Azure route table, and associate it with the OD@A subnet:
Address prefix: 192.168.0.0/16
Next hop type: Virtual appliance
Next hop IP address: 10.0.0.5
Name: <Route table name>
The following diagram shows the updated network configuration.

Do the following steps to verify connectivity:
Sign in to an OD@A database node. Verify that you can use the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to establish a connection to the on-premises database server.

Do migration activities
Prepare for the migration. For more information, seePrepare for a physical database migration.NoteThis guidance assumes that you have sufficient bandwidth between the source and target databases to support an online migration. It assumes that you don't need to do an offline migration, or a restore of backup on OD@A, first.

Conclusion
Do the preceding configuration changes to migrate your database from on-premises to OD@A by using Oracle ZDM. The configuration changes help ensure that the source and target databases can communicate with each other and that you perform the migration with minimal downtime.
