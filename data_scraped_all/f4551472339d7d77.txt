Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cloud-basedAzure AI servicethat enables you to build intelligent document processing solutions. Massive amounts of data, spanning a wide variety of data types, are stored in forms and documents. Document Intelligence enables you to effectively manage the velocity at which data is collected and processed and is key to improved operations, informed data-driven decisions, and enlightened innovation.For information on region access,seeAzure AI ServicesProduct Availability by Region.

Custom models
Custom models are trained using your labeled datasets to extract distinct data from forms and documents, specific to your use cases. Standalone custom models can be combined to create composed models.
Document field extraction models
âï¸ Document field extraction models are trained to extract labeled fields from documents.
Custom neural| Extract data from mixed-type documents.
Custom template| Extract data from static layouts.
Custom composed| Extract data using a collection of models.
Custom classification models
âï¸ Custom classifiers identify document types before invoking an extraction model.
Custom classifier| Identify designated document types (classes) before invoking an extraction model.
