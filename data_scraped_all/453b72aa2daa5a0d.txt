In Azure AI Search, asearch indexis your searchable content, available to the search engine for indexing, full text search, vector search, hybrid search, and filtered queries. An index is defined by a schema and saved to the search service, with data import following as a second step. This content exists within your search service, apart from your primary data stores, which is necessary for the millisecond response times expected in modern search applications. Except for indexer-driven indexing scenarios, the search service never connects to or queries your source data.
If you want to create and manage a search index, this article helps you understand the following points:
Content (documents and schema)

Schema of a search index
In Azure AI Search, indexes containsearch documents. Conceptually, a document is a single unit of searchable data in your index. For example, a retailer might have a document for each product, a university might have a document for each class, a travel site might have a document for each hotel and destination, and so forth. Mapping these concepts to more familiar database equivalents: asearch indexequates to atable, anddocumentsare roughly equivalent torowsin a table.
The structure of a document is determined by theindex schema, as illustrated in the following example. The "fields" collection is typically the largest part of an index, where each field is named, assigned adata type, and attributed with allowable behaviors that determine how it's used.

  "name": "name_of_index, unique across the service",
  "fields": [
    {

Field definitions
A search document is defined by the "fields" collection in the body ofCreate Index request. You need fields for document identification (keys), storing searchable text, and fields for supporting filters, facets, and sorting. You might also need fields for data that a user never sees. For example, you might want fields for profit margins or marketing promotions that you can use in a scoring profile to boost a search score.
If incoming data is hierarchical in nature, you can represent it within an index as acomplex type, used for nested structures. The built-in sample data set, Hotels, illustrates complex types using an Address (contains multiple subfields) that has a one-to-one relationship with each hotel, and a Rooms complex collection, where multiple rooms are associated with each hotel.

Field attributes
Field attributes determine how a field is used, such as whether it's used in full text search, faceted navigation, sort operations, and so forth.
String fields are often marked as "searchable" and "retrievable". Fields used to narrow search results include "sortable", "filterable", and "facetable".
Edm.String
Collection(Edm.String)
$filter=f eq 'sunny'
$filter=f eq 'sunny day'
Collection(Edm.String)
Edm.GeographyPoint
Edm.String
Edm.String
true
key
Although you can add new fields at any time, existing field definitions are locked in for the lifetime of the index. For this reason, developers typically use the Azure portal for creating simple indexes, testing ideas, or using the Azure portal pages to look up a setting. Frequent iteration over an index design is more efficient if you follow a code-based approach so that you can rebuild the index easily.
Note
The APIs you use to build an index have varying default behaviors. For theREST APIs, most attributes are enabled by default (for example, "searchable" and "retrievable" are true for string fields) and you often only need to set them if you want to turn them off. For the .NET SDK, the opposite is true. On any property you do not explicitly set, the default is to disable the corresponding search behavior unless you specifically enable it.

Physical structure and size
In Azure AI Search, the physical structure of an index is largely an internal implementation. You can access its schema, query its content, monitor its size, and manage capacity, but the clusters themselves (inverted indexes, vector indexes,shards, and other files and folders) are managed internally by Microsoft.
You can monitor index size in theSearch management > Indexespage in the Azure portal, or by issuing aGET INDEX requestagainst your search service. You can also issue aService Statistics requestand check the value of storage size.
The size of an index is determined by:
Quantity and composition of your documents
Attributes on individual fields
Index configuration (specifically, whether you include suggesters)
Document composition and quantity are determined by what you choose to import. Remember that a search index should only contain searchable content. If source data includes binary fields, omit those fields unless you're using AI enrichment to crack and analyze the content to create text searchable information.
Field attributes determine behaviors. To support those behaviors, the indexing process creates the necessary data structures. For example, for a field of typeEdm.String, "searchable" invokesfull text search, which scans inverted indexes for the tokenized term. In contrast, a "filterable" or "sortable" attribute supports iteration over unmodified strings. The example in the next section shows variations in index size based on the selected attributes.
Edm.String
Suggestersare constructs that support type-ahead or autocomplete queries. As such, when you include a suggester, the indexing process creates the data structures necessary for verbatim character matches. Suggesters are implemented at the field level, so choose only those fields that are reasonable for type-ahead.
Example demonstrating the storage implications of attributes and suggesters
The following screenshot illustrates index storage patterns resulting from various combinations of attributes. The index is based on thereal estate sample index, which you can create easily using the Import data wizard and built-in sample data. Although the index schemas aren't shown, you can infer the attributes based on the index name. For example,realestate-searchableindex has the "searchable" attribute selected and nothing else,realestate-retrievableindex has the "retrievable" attribute selected and nothing else, and so forth.

Although these index variants are somewhat artificial, we can refer to them for broad comparisons of how attributes affect storage:
"retrievable" has no effect on index size.
"filterable", "sortable", "facetable" consume more storage.
suggesterhas a large potential for increasing index size, but not as much as the screenshot would indicate (all fields that could be made suggester-aware were selected, which isn't a likely scenario in most indexes).
Also not reflected in the previous table is the effect ofanalyzers. If you use the edgeNgram tokenizer to store verbatim sequences of characters (a, ab, abc, abcd), the index is larger than if you use the standard analyzer.
a, ab, abc, abcd
Basic operations and interaction
Now that you have a better idea of what an index is, this section introduces index run time operations, including connecting to and securing a single index.
Note
When managing an index, be aware that there is no portal or API support for moving or copying an index. Instead, customers typically point their application deployment solution at a different search service (if using the same index name), or revise the name to create a copy on the current search service, and then build it.
Index isolation
In Azure AI Search, you work with one index at a time, where all index-related operations target a single index. There's no concept of related indexes or the joining of independent indexes for either indexing or querying.
Continuously available
An index is immediately available for queries as soon as the first document is indexed, but won't be fully operational until all documents are indexed. Internally, a search index isdistributed across partitions and executes on replicas. The physical index is managed internally. The logical index is managed by you.
An index is continuously available, with no ability to pause or take it offline. Because it's designed for continuous operation, any updates to its content, or additions to the index itself, happen in real time. As a result, queries might temporarily return incomplete results if a request coincides with a document update.
Notice that query continuity exists for document operations (refreshing or deleting) and for modifications that don't affect the existing structure and integrity of the current index (such as adding new fields). If you need to make structural updates (changing existing fields), those are typically managed using a drop-and-rebuild workflow in a development environment, or by creating a new version of the index on production service.
To avoid anindex rebuild, some customers who are making small changes choose to "version" a field by creating a new one that coexists alongside a previous version. Over time, this leads to orphaned content in the form of obsolete fields or obsolete custom analyzer definitions, especially in a production index that is expensive to replicate. You can address these issues on planned updates to the index as part of index lifecycle management.
Endpoint connection and security
All indexing and query requests target an index. Endpoints are usually one of the following:
<your-service>.search.windows.net/indexes
<your-service>.search.windows.net/indexes/<your-index>/docs
Start with the Azure portal. Azure subscribers, or the person who created the search service, can manage the search service in the Azure portal. An Azure subscription requires Contributor or above permissions to create or delete services. This permission level is sufficient for fully managing a search service in the Azure portal.
