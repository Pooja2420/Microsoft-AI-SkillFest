Azure Web PubSub Service supports Microsoft Entra ID for authorizing requests withMicrosoft Entra applications.
This article explains how to set up your resource and code to authenticate requests to the resource using a Microsoft Entra application.
Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID
The first step is toRegister an application in Microsoft Entra ID:
After you register your application, you can find theApplication (client) IDandDirectory (tenant) IDvalues on the application's overview page. These GUIDs can be useful in the following steps.

Add credentials
After registering an app, you can addcertificates, client secrets (a string), or federated identity credentialsas credentials to your confidential client app registration. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime, and are used by confidential client applications that access a web API.
