Virtual Machine (VM) health annotations inform any ongoing activity that influences the availability of VMs (seeResource types and health checks). Annotations carry metadata that help rationalize the exact impact to availability.
Here are more details on important attributes recently added to help understand below annotations you might observe inResource Health,Azure Resource GraphandEvent Grid Systemtopics:
Context: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to Azure or user orchestrated activity. It can assume values ofPlatform Initiated | Customer Initiated | VM Initiated | Unknown
Context: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to Azure or user orchestrated activity. It can assume values ofPlatform Initiated | Customer Initiated | VM Initiated | Unknown
Category: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to planned or unplanned activity and is only applicable toPlatform-Initiatedevents. It can assume values ofPlanned | Unplanned | Not Applicable | Unknown

Platform-Initiated
ImpactType: Informs the type of impact to VM availability. It can assume values of:Downtime Reboot or Downtime Freeze:  Informs when VM is Unavailable due to Azure orchestrated activity (for example, VirtualMachineStorageOffline, LiveMigrationSucceeded etc.). The reboot or freeze distinction can help you discern the type of downtime impact faced.Degraded: Informs when Azure predicts a HW failure on the host server or detects potential degradation in performance. (for example, VirtualMachinePossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailure)Informational: Informs when an authorized user or process triggers a control plane operation (for example, VirtualMachineDeallocationInitiated, VirtualMachineRestarted). This category also captures cases of platform actions due to customer defined thresholds or conditions. (for example, VirtualMachinePreempted)

Note
A VMs availability impact start and end time isonlyapplicable to degraded annotations, and does not apply to downtime or informational annotations.
