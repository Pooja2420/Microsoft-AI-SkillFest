In this article,  you learn how to integrate AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate AWS IAM Identity Center with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:
Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to AWS IAM Identity Center.
Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to AWS IAM Identity Center with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
Manage your accounts in one central location.
Note:When using AWS Organizations, it's important to delegate another account as the Identity Center Administration account, enable the IAM Identity Center on it, and set up the Entra ID SSO with that account, not the root management account. This ensures a more secure and manageable setup.
Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:
A Microsoft Entra user account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you canCreate an account for free.
One of the following roles:Application AdministratorCloud Application AdministratorApplication Owner.
Application Administrator
Cloud Application Administrator
Application Owner.
An AWS Organizations setup with another account delegated as the Identity Center Administration account.
AWS IAM Identity Center enabled on the delegated Identity Center Administration account.
Scenario description
In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.
Note:Ensure you delegated another account as the Identity Center Administration account and enabled IAM Identity Center on it before proceeding with the following steps.

Add AWS IAM Identity Center from the gallery
To configure the integration of AWS IAM Identity Center into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add AWS IAM Identity Center from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aCloud Application Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Enterprise apps>New application.
In theAdd from the gallerysection, typeAWS IAM Identity Centerin the search box.
SelectAWS IAM Identity Centerfrom results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.
Alternatively, you can also use theEnterprise App Configuration Wizard. In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles and walk through the SSO configuration as well.Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for AWS IAM Identity Center
Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with AWS IAM Identity Center using a test user calledB.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in AWS IAM Identity Center.
To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with AWS IAM Identity Center, perform the following steps:
Configure Microsoft Entra SSO- to enable your users to use this feature.Create a Microsoft Entra test user- to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.Assign the Microsoft Entra test user- to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
Create a Microsoft Entra test user- to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
Assign the Microsoft Entra test user- to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
Configure AWS IAM Identity Center SSO- to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.Create AWS IAM Identity Center test user- to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AWS IAM Identity Center that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
Create AWS IAM Identity Center test user- to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AWS IAM Identity Center that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
Test SSO- to verify whether the configuration works.

AWS IAM Identity Center application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.NoteIf ABAC is enabled in AWS IAM Identity Center, the additional attributes may be passed as session tags directly into AWS accounts.

Test SSO
In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
SelectTest this application, this option redirects to AWS IAM Identity Center sign-in URL where you can initiate the login flow.

Go to AWS IAM Identity Center sign-in URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
Go to AWS IAM Identity Center sign-in URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
SelectTest this application, and you should be automatically signed in to the AWS IAM Identity Center for which you set up the SSO.
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the AWS IAM Identity Center tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the AWS IAM Identity Center for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, seeIntroduction to the My Apps.
