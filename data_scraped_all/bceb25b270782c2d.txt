The Azure Storage platform is the Microsoft cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios.
The Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:
Azure Blob Storage: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
Azure NetApp Files: An Azure native, first-party, enterprise-class, high-performance file storage service.
Azure Queue Storage: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
Azure Table Storage: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
Azure Disk Storage: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.
Introduction to storage on Azure
If you're new to storage on Azure, the best way to learn more isMicrosoft Learn training. This free online platform provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more. Check out theStore data in Azurelearning path.
