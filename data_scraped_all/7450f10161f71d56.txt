Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)is the authorization system you use to manage access to Azure resources. To grant access, you assign roles to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities at a particular scope. This article describes how to assign roles using the Azure portal.
If you need to assign administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID, seeAssign Microsoft Entra roles to users.
Prerequisites
To assign Azure roles, you must have:
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermissions, such asRole Based Access Control AdministratororUser Access Administrator
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Step 1: Identify the needed scope
When you assign roles, you must specify a scope. Scope is the set of resources the access applies to. In Azure, you can specify a scope at four levels from broad to narrow:management group, subscription,resource group, and resource. For more information, seeUnderstand scope.

Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the Search box at the top, search for the scope you want to grant access to. For example, search forManagement groups,Subscriptions,Resource groups, or a specific resource.

Click the specific resource for that scope.The following shows an example resource group.

Step 2: Open the Add role assignment page
Access control (IAM)is the page that you typically use to assign roles to grant access to Azure resources. It's also known as identity and access management (IAM) and appears in several locations in the Azure portal.
ClickAccess control (IAM).The following shows an example of the Access control (IAM) page for a resource group.

Step 5: (Optional) Add condition
If you selected a role that supports conditions, aConditionstab will appear and you have the option to add a condition to your role assignment. Aconditionis an additional check that you can optionally add to your role assignment to provide more fine-grained access control.
TheConditionstab will look different depending on the role you selected.
Delegate condition
If you selected one of the following privileged roles, follow the steps in this section.
Owner
Role Based Access Control Administrator
User Access Administrator
On theConditionstab underWhat user can do, select theAllow user to only assign selected roles to selected principals (fewer privileges)option.

Step 6: Select assignment type
If you have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license, anAssignment typetab will appear for management group, subscription, and resource group scopes. Use eligible assignments to provide just-in-time access to a role. Users with eligible and/or time-bound assignments must have a valid license.
If you don't want to use the PIM functionality, select theActiveassignment type andPermanentassignment duration options. These settings create a role assignment where the principal always has permissions in the role.
This capability is being deployed in stages, so it might not be available yet in your tenant or your interface might look different. For more information, seeEligible and time-bound role assignments in Azure RBAC.
On theAssignment typetab, select theAssignment type.Eligible- User must perform one or more actions to use the role, such as perform a multifactor authentication check, provide a business justification, or request approval from designated approvers. You can't create eligible role assignments for applications, service principals, or managed identities because they can't perform the activation steps.Active-  User doesn't have to perform any action to use the role.

Active-  User doesn't have to perform any action to use the role.

Depending on your settings, forAssignment duration, selectPermanentorTime bound.Select permanent if you want member to always be allowed to activate or use role. Select time bound to specify start and end dates. This option might be disabled if permanent assignments creation is not allowed by PIM policy.
