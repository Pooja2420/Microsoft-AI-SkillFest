Best practices
Ensuring application reliability requirescomprehensive testingin Azure Pipelines, with unit tests and integration tests being essential. Testing integrations in cloud environments, particularlyserverless applications, poses challenges due to distributed architectures, misconfiguredIAM permissions, and service-to-service integration issues.
To address this, consider running your code locally while interacting with genuine Azure services, facilitating realistic tests and enabling debugger tools suitable for automated testing. Implementing this approach requires provisioning ephemeral Azure resources. Ideally, createseparate accounts for each environment; alternatively, dynamic provisioning within Azure pipelines is possible, although this increases execution time and necessitates careful resource decommissioning planning. To minimize naming conflicts, avoid explicit resource naming unless necessary and include environment names in resource names.
