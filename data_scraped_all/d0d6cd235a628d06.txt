This article describes how you can integrate Azure Monitor with supported IT Service Management (ITSM) products.
Azure services like Log Analytics and Azure Monitor provide tools to detect, analyze, and troubleshoot problems with your Azure and non-Azure resources. But the work items related to an issue typically reside in an ITSM product or service.
Azure Monitor provides a bidirectional connection between Azure and ITSM tools to help you resolve issues faster. You can create work items in your ITSM tool based on your Azure metric alerts, activity log alerts, and log search alerts.
Azure Monitor supports connections with the following ITSM tools:
ServiceNow ITSM or IT Operations Management (ITOM)
BMC
ITSM integration workflow
Depending on your integration, start connecting to your ITSM tool with these steps:

As of October 2023, we do not support creating a connector for ITSM actions that send alerts and events to ServiceNow in the user interface. If you still want to create ITSM actions before this feature is fully deprecated, use theAPI.Connect to your ITSM. For more information, see theServiceNow connection instructions.(Optional) Set up the IP ranges. To list the ITSM IP addresses to allow ITSM connections from partner ITSM tools, list the whole public IP range of an Azure region where the Log Analytics workspace belongs. For more information, see theMicrosoft Download Center. For regions EUS/WEU/WUS2/US South Central, the customer can list the ActionGroup network tag only.Configure your Azure ITSM solution and create the ITSM connection.Configure an action group to use the ITSM connector.
