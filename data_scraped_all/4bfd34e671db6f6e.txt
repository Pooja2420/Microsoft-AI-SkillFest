Marks that the order of the input row set is safe to use for window functions.
The operator has a declarative meaning. It marks the input row set as serialized (ordered), so thatwindow functionscan be applied to it.

Serialize subset of rows by condition
This query retrieves all log entries from theTraceLogstable that have a specificClientRequestIdand preserves the order of these entries during processing.
Run the query
TraceLogs
| where ClientRequestId == "5a848f70-9996-eb17-15ed-21b8eb94bf0e"
| serialize
TraceLogs
| where ClientRequestId == "5a848f70-9996-eb17-15ed-21b8eb94bf0e"
| serialize
Output
This table only shows the top 5 query results.
Add row number to the serialized table
To add a row number to the serialized table, use therow_number()function.
Run the query
TraceLogs
| where ClientRequestId == "5a848f70-9996-eb17-15ed-21b8eb94bf0e"
| serialize rn = row_number()
TraceLogs
| where ClientRequestId == "5a848f70-9996-eb17-15ed-21b8eb94bf0e"
| serialize rn = row_number()
Output
This table only shows the top 5 query results.
Serialization behavior of operators
The output row set of the following operators is marked as serialized.
getschema
range
sort
top
top-hitters
The output row set of the following operators is marked as nonserialized.
count
distinct
evaluate
facet
join
make-series
mv-expand
reduce by
sample
sample-distinct
summarize
top-nested
All other operators preserve the serialization property. If the input row set is serialized, then the output row set is also serialized.
