Artifact download location
Artifacts from the current pipeline are downloaded to$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<artifact name>.
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<artifact name>
Artifacts from the associated pipeline resource are downloaded to$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<pipeline resource identifier>/<artifact name>.
$(Pipeline.Workspace)/<pipeline resource identifier>/<artifact name>
Automatic download in deployment jobs
All available artifacts from the current pipeline and from the associated pipeline resources are automatically downloaded in deployment jobs and made available for your deployment.
To prevent downloads, specifydownload: none.
