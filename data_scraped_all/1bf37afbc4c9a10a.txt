The Azure API Management service supportsavailability zonesin both zonal and zone-redundant configurations:
Zonal- the API Management gateway and the control plane of your API Management instance (management API, developer portal, Git configuration) are deployed in a single zone you select within an Azure region.

Zone-redundant- the gateway and the control plane of your API Management instance (management API, developer portal, Git configuration) are replicated across two or more physically separated zones within an Azure region. Zone redundancy provides resiliency and high availability to a service instance.

Zone redundancy provides resiliency and high availability to a service instance.
This article describes four scenarios for migrating an API Management instance to availability zones. For more information about configuring API Management for high availability, seeEnsure API Management availability and reliability.
Important
Changes to your API Management service's infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration.
While the service is updating, other service infrastructure changes can't be made. However, you can configure APIs, products, policies, and user settings. The service will not experience gateway downtime (except in the Developer tier).
Prerequisites
To configure availability zones for API Management, your instance must be in one of theAzure regions that support availability zones.

If you don't have an API Management instance, create one by following theCreate a new Azure API Management instance by using the Azure portalquickstart. Select the Premium service tier.

If you have an existing API Management instance, make sure that it's in the Premium tier. If it isn't,upgrade to the Premium tier.

Downtime requirements
There are no downtime requirements for any of the migration options.
Considerations
Changes can take 15 to 45 minutes to apply. The API Management gateway can continue to handle API requests during this time.

When you're migrating an API Management instance that's deployed in an external or internal virtual network to availability zones, you can optionally specify a new public IP address resource. In an internal virtual network, the public IP address is used only for management operations, not for API requests.Learn more about IP addresses of API Management.

Migrating to availability zones or changing the configuration of availability zones triggers a public and privateIP address change.

When you're enabling availability zones in a region, you configure API Management scaleunitsthat you can distribute evenly across the zones. For example, if you configure two zones, you can configure two units, four units, or another multiple of two units.NoteUsecapacity metricsand your own testing to decide the number of scale units that will provide the gateway performance for your needs. Adding units incurs additional costs. Learn more aboutscaling and upgradingyour service instance.NoteWhen availability zones are configured for your API Management instance, under normal operating conditions all scale units in all configured zones are active and serve gateway traffic.

If you configured autoscaling for your API Management instance in the primary location, you might need to adjust your autoscale settings after configuring availability zones. The number of API Management units in autoscale rules and limits must be a multiple of the number of zones.

Existing gateway location (stv1 platform) injected in a virtual network
To migrate an existing location of your API Management instance to availability zones when the instance is currently injected in a virtual network and is currently hosted on thestv1platform, use the following steps. Migrating to availability zones also migrates the instance to thestv2platform.
