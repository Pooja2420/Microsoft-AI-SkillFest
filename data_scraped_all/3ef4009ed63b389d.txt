Important
The Connected Machine agent cannot be installed on an Azure virtual machine. The install script will warn you and roll back if it detects the server is running in Azure.
Be sure to review the basicprerequisitesandnetwork configuration requirementsbefore deploying the agent, as well as any specific requirements listed in the steps for the onboarding method you choose. To learn more about what changes the agent will make to your system, seeOverview of the Azure Connected Machine Agent.
Automatic connection for SQL Server
When you connect a Windows or Linux server to Azure Arc that also has Microsoft SQL Server installed, the SQL Server instances will automatically be connected to Azure Arc as well.SQL Server enabled by Azure Arcprovides a detailed inventory and additional management capabilities for your SQL Server instances and databases. As part of the connection process, an extension is deployed to your Azure Arc-enabled server andnew roleswill be applied to your SQL Server and databases. If you don't want to automatically connect your SQL Servers to Azure Arc, you can opt out by adding a tag to the Windows or Linux server with the nameArcSQLServerExtensionDeploymentand valueDisabledwhen it's connected to Azure Arc.
