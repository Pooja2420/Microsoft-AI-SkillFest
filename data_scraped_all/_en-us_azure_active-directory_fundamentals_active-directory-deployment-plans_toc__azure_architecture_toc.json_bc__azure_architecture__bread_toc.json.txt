Azure Active Directory is nowMicrosoft Entra ID, which can safeguard your organization with cloud identity and access management. The solution connects employees, customers, and partners to their apps, devices, and data.
Use this article's guidance to help build your plan to deploy Microsoft Entra ID. Learn about plan-building basics and then use the following sections for authentication deployment, apps and devices, hybrid scenarios, user identity, and more.
Stakeholders and roles
When beginning your deployment plans, include your key stakeholders. Identify and document stakeholders, affected roles, and the areas of ownership and responsibilities that enable an effective deployment. Titles and roles differ from one organization to another, however the ownership areas are similar. See the following table for common and influential roles that affect any deployment plan.
RACI
Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (responsible/accountable/consulted/informed (RACI)) is a model for the participation by various roles to complete tasks or deliverables for a project or business process. Use this model to help ensure the roles in your organization understand deployment responsibilities.
Responsible- The people accountable for the correct completion of the task.There is at least one Responsible role, although you can delegate others to help deliver the work.
There is at least one Responsible role, although you can delegate others to help deliver the work.
Accountable- The one ultimately answerable for the correctness and completion of the deliverable or task. The Accountable role ensures task prerequisites are met and delegates work to responsible roles. The Accountable role approves work that Responsible provides. Assign one Accountable for each task or deliverable.
Consulted- The Consulted role provides guidance, typically a subject matter expert (SME).
Informed- The people kept up to date on progress, generally upon completion of a task or deliverable.
Authentication deployment
Use the following list to plan for authentication deployment.
Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA)- Using admin-approved authentication methods, multifactor authentication helps safeguard access to your data and applications while meeting the demand for easy sign-in:See the video,How to configure and enforce multifactor authentication in your tenantSee,Plan a multifactor authentication deployment

Microsoft Entra application proxy- Enable employees to be productive from a device. Learn about software as a service (SaaS) apps in the cloud and corporate apps on-premises. Microsoft Entra application proxy enables access without virtual private networks (VPNs) or demilitarized zones (DMZs):See,Remote access to on-premises applications through Microsoft Entra application proxySee,Plan a Microsoft Entra application proxy deployment

Seamless single sign-on (Seamless SSO)- Use Seamless SSO for user sign-in, on corporate devices connected to a corporate network. Users don't need passwords to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID, and usually don't need to enter usernames. Authorized users access cloud-based apps without extra on-premises components:See,Microsoft Entra SSO: QuickstartSee,Microsoft Entra seamless SSO: Technical deep dive

Users
User identities- Learn about automation to create, maintain, and remove user identities in cloud apps, such as Dropbox, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and more.See,Plan an automatic user provisioning deployment in Microsoft Entra ID
See,Plan an automatic user provisioning deployment in Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft Entra ID Governance- Create identity governance and enhance business processes that rely on identity data. With HR products, such as Workday or Successfactors, manage employee and contingent-staff identity lifecycle with rules. These rules map Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JLM) processes, such as New Hire, Terminate, Transfer, to IT actions such as Create, Enable, Disable.

Best practices for a pilot
Before making a change for larger groups, or everyone, use pilots to test with a small group. Ensure each use case in your organization is tested.
Pilot: Phase 1
In your first phase, target IT, usability, and other users who can test and provide feedback. Use this feedback to gain insights on potential issues for support staff, and to develop communications and instructions you send to all users.
Pilot: Phase 2
Widen the pilot to larger groups of users by using dynamic membership, or by manually adding users to the targeted groups.
