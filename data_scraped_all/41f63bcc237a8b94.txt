This article outlines how to register Azure Machine Learning and how to authenticate and interact with Azure Machine Learning in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read theintroductory article.
This integration between Azure Machine Learning and Microsoft Purview applies an auto push model that, once the Azure Machine Learning workspace has been registered in Microsoft Purview, the metadata from workspace is pushed to Microsoft Purview automatically on a daily basis. It isn't necessary to manually scan to bring metadata from the workspace into Microsoft Purview.
Important
This feature is currently in preview. TheSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsinclude additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Supported capabilities
When scanning the Azure Machine Learning source, Microsoft Purview supports:
Extracting technical metadata from Azure Machine Learning, including:WorkspaceModelsDatasetsJobs
Workspace
Models
Datasets
Jobs
Note
AML workspaces don't currently support pushing metadata through a private endpoint to Microsoft Purview.
You must register assets in your AML workspace for them to appear in Microsoft Purview.
Forclassifications,sensitivity labels,policies,data lineage, andlive view, see thelist of supported capabilities.

Scan
After you register your Azure Machine Learning workspace, the metadata will be automatically pushed to Microsoft Purview on a daily basis.
Browse and discover
To access the browse experience for data assets from your Azure Machine Learning workspace, selectBrowse Assets.

Browse by collection
Browse by collection allows you to explore the different collections you're a data reader or curator for.

Browse by source type
On the browse by source types page, selectAzure Machine Learning.
On the browse by source types page, selectAzure Machine Learning.

The top-level assets under your selected data type are listed. Pick one of the assets to further explore its contents. For example, after selecting Azure Machine Learning, you'll see a list of workspaces with assets in Unified Catalog.

Lineage
To view lineage information, select an asset and then select theLineagetab. From the lineage tab, you can see the asset's relationships when applicable. You can see what source data was used (if registered in Purview), the data asset created in Azure Machine Learning, any jobs, and finally the resulting machine learning model. In more advanced scenarios, you can see:
If multiple data sources were used
Multiple stages of training on multiple data assets
If multiple models were created from the same data sources
