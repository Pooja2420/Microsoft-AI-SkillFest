As with on GitHub, Advanced Security will be able to produce validity data for selected partner tokens.
Validity checks determine whether a token is still active and, when possible, whether it was ever active. This is useful when youâre deciding how to remediate an exposure. For example, you might prioritize remediating active secrets before checking your security logs for unauthorized access via API keys that have already been revoked.
