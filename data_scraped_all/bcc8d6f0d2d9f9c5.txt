This article shows you how to scale your app in Azure App Service. There are two workflows for scaling, scale up and scale out, and this article explains the scale up workflow.
Scale up: Get more CPU, memory, or disk space, or extra features
like dedicated virtual machines (VMs), custom domains and certificates, staging slots, autoscaling, and more. You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the
App Service plan that your app belongs to.
Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app.
Basic, Standard, and Premium service plans scale out to as many as 3, 10, and 30 instances, respectively.App Service Environmentsin the Isolated tier further increase your scale-out count to 100 instances. For more information about scaling out, seeScale instance count manually or automatically. There, you find out how
to use autoscaling, which is to scale instance count automatically based on predefined rules and schedules.
Important
App Service offers an automatic scale-out option to handle varying incoming HTTP requests.
The scale settings take only seconds to apply and affect all apps in yourApp Service plan.
They don't require you to change your code or redeploy your application.
For information about the pricing and features of individual App Service plans, seeApp Service Pricing Details.
Note
Before you switch an App Service plan from the Free tier, you must first remove thespending limitsin place for your Azure subscription. To view or change options for your App Service subscription, seeCost Management + Billingin the Azure portal.

Scale related resources
If your app depends on other services, such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Storage, you can scale up these resources separately. These resources aren't managed by the App Service plan.
In theOverviewpage for your app, select theResource grouplink.
In theOverviewpage for your app, select theResource grouplink.

On theOverviewpage for the resource group, select a resource that you want to scale. The following screenshot
shows a SQL Database resource.To scale up the related resource, see the documentation for the specific resource type. For example, to scale up a single SQL database, seeScale single database resources in Azure SQL Database. To scale up an Azure Database for MySQL resource, seeScale Azure Database for MySQL resources.
