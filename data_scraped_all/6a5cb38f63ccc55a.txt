This article describes how to use Microsoft Entra ID to create the authentication credentials for using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send an email using Azure Communication Services.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
An Azure Communication Email Resource created and ready with a provisioned domainCreate Email Communication Resource.
An active Azure Communication Services Resource connected with Email Domain and a Connection String.Connect an Email Resource with a Communication Resource.
A Microsoft Entra ID with access to the Azure Communication Services Resource.Register an application with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal.
A client secret for Microsoft Entra ID with access to the Azure Communication Service Resource.Create a new client secret.
Use Microsoft Entra ID with access to the Azure Communication Services Resource for SMTP
Application developers who build apps that send email using the SMTP protocol need to implement secure, modern authentication. Azure Communication Services handles authentication using Microsoft Entra ID service principals. Combining the Azure Communication Services Resource and the Microsoft Entra ID service principal's information, the SMTP services authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID on the user's behalf to ensure a secure and seamless email transmission.
Create a custom email role for Microsoft Entra ID
You need to assign Microsoft Entra ID a role with both theMicrosoft.Communication/CommunicationServices/Read,Microsoft.Communication/CommunicationServices/Write, and theMicrosoft.Communication/EmailServices/writepermissions on the Azure Communication Service Resource. Create a custom email role using either theContributorrole, or by creating acustom role. Follow these steps to create a custom role by cloning an existing role.
In the portal, create a custom role by first navigating to the subscription, resource group, or Azure Communication Service Resource where you want the custom role to be assignable and then openAccess control (IAM).
Click theRolestab to see a list of all the built-in and custom roles.
Search for a role you want to clone such as the Reader role.
At the end of the row, click the ellipsis (...) and then clickClone.
Click theBasicstab and give a name to the new role.
Click thePermissionstab and clickAdd permissions. Search forMicrosoft.Communicationand selectAzure Communication Services
Select theMicrosoft.Communication/CommunicationServicesRead,Microsoft.Communication/CommunicationServicesWrite, and theMicrosoft.Communication/EmailServicesWritepermissions. ClickAdd.
Review the permissions for the new role. ClickReview + createand thenCreateon the next page.
When assigning Microsoft Entra ID a role for the Azure Communication Services Resource, the new custom role is available. For more information on creating custom roles, seeCreate or update Azure custom roles using the Azure portal.
Assign the custom email role to Microsoft Entra ID
In the portal, navigate to the subscription, resource group, or Azure Communication Service Resource where you want the custom role to be assignable and then openAccess control (IAM).
Click+Addand then selectAdd role assignment.
On theRoletab, select the custom role created for sending emails using SMTP and clickNext.
On theMemberstab, chooseUser, group, or service principaland then click+Select members.
Use the search box to find theMicrosoft Entraapplication that you use for authentication and select it. Then clickSelect.
After confirming the selection, clickNext.
After confirming the scope and members, clickReview + assign.
Create the SMTP credentials from the Microsoft Entra ID information
Azure Communication Services enables you to use the credentials for Microsoft Entra ID as the SMTP username and password. The username consists of the following three parts and can be pipe or dot delimited.
The Azure Communication Service Resource name.
The Microsoft Entra Application ID.
The Microsoft Entra Tenant ID.
Dot-delimited Format:
username: <Azure Communication Services Resource name>.<Microsoft Entra Application ID>.<Microsoft Entra Tenant ID>
username: <Azure Communication Services Resource name>.<Microsoft Entra Application ID>.<Microsoft Entra Tenant ID>
Pipe-delimited Format:
username: <Azure Communication Services Resource name>|<Microsoft Entra Application ID>|<Microsoft Entra Tenant ID>
username: <Azure Communication Services Resource name>|<Microsoft Entra Application ID>|<Microsoft Entra Tenant ID>
The password is a Microsoft Entra ID client secret.
Requirements for SMTP AUTH client submission
Authentication: Username and password authentication is supported using the Microsoft Entra ID details as the credentials. The Azure Communication Services SMTP service uses the Microsoft Entra ID details to get an access token on behalf of the user and use that to submit the email. The Microsoft Entra ID token isn't cached. So you can revoke access immediately by either changing the Microsoft Entra ID client secret or by changing the access controls for the Azure Communication Services Resource.
Azure Communication Service: An Azure Communication Services Resource with a connected Azure Communication Email Resource and domain is required.
Transport Layer Security (TLS): Your device must be able to use TLS version 1.2 and above.
Port: Port 587 (recommended) or port 25 is required and must be unblocked on your network. Some network firewalls or ISPs block ports because that's the port that email servers use to send mail.
DNS: Use the DNS name smtp.azurecomm.net. Don't use an IP address for the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 server, as IP Addresses aren't supported.
How to set up SMTP AUTH client submission
Enter the following settings directly on your device or in the application as their guide instructs (it might use different terminology than this article). Provided your scenario aligns with the prerequisites for SMTP AUTH client submission, these settings enable you to send emails from your device or application using SMTP Commands.
