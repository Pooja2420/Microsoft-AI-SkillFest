The integration of Service Bus withVirtual Network service endpointsenables secure access to messaging capabilities from workloads like virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks, with the network traffic path being secured on both ends.
Once configured to be bound to at least one virtual network subnet service endpoint, the respective Service Bus namespace will no longer accept traffic from anywhere but the authorized virtual networks and, optionally, specific internet IP addresses. From the virtual network perspective, binding a Service Bus namespace to a service endpoint configures an isolated networking tunnel from the virtual network subnet to the messaging service.
The result is a private and isolated relationship between the workloads bound to the subnet and the respective Service Bus namespace, in spite of the observable network address of the messaging service endpoint being in a public IP range.
Important points
Virtual Networks are supported only inPremium tierService Bus namespaces. When using virtual network service endpoints with Service Bus, you shouldn't enable these endpoints in applications that mix standard and premium tier Service Bus namespaces. Because the standard tier doesn't support virtual networks. The endpoint is restricted to Premium tier namespaces only.

Implementing Virtual Networks integration can prevent other Azure services from interacting with Service Bus. As an exception, you can allow access to Service Bus resources from certaintrusted serviceseven when network service endpoints are enabled.

Advanced security scenarios enabled by virtual network integration
Solutions that require tight and compartmentalized security, and where virtual network subnets provide the segmentation between the compartmentalized services, generally still need communication paths between services residing in those compartments.
Any immediate IP route between the compartments, including those carrying HTTPS over TCP/IP, carries the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities from the network layer on up. Messaging services provide insulated communication paths, where messages are even written to disk as they transition between parties. Workloads in two distinct virtual networks that are both bound to the same Service Bus instance can communicate efficiently and reliably via messages, while the respective network isolation boundary integrity is preserved.
That means your security sensitive cloud solutions not only gain access to Azure industry-leading reliable and  scalable asynchronous messaging capabilities, but they can now use messaging to create communication paths between secure solution compartments that are inherently more secure than what is achievable with any peer-to-peer communication mode, including HTTPS and other TLS-secured socket protocols.
Binding Service Bus to virtual networks
Virtual network rulesare the firewall security feature that controls whether your Azure Service Bus server accepts connections from a particular virtual network subnet.
Binding a Service Bus namespace to a virtual network is a two-step process. You first need to create aVirtual Network service endpointon a Virtual Network subnet and enable it forMicrosoft.ServiceBusas explained in theservice endpoint overview. Once you've added the service endpoint, you bind the Service Bus namespace to it with avirtual network rule.
The virtual network rule is an association of the Service Bus namespace with a virtual network subnet. While the rule exists, all workloads bound to the subnet are granted access to the Service Bus namespace. Service Bus itself never establishes outbound connections, doesn't need to gain access, and is therefore never granted access to your subnet by enabling this rule.
Note
Remember that a network service endpoint provides applications running in the virtual network the access to the Service Bus namespace. The virtual network controls the reachability of the endpoint, but not what operations can be done on Service Bus entities (queues, topics, or subscriptions). Use Microsoft Entra ID to authorize operations that the applications can perform on the namespace and its entities. For more information, seeAuthenticate and authorize an application with Microsoft Entra ID to access Service Bus entities.
Use Azure portal
When creating a namespace, you can either allow public only (from all networks) or private only (only via private endpoints) access to the namespace. Once the namespace is created, you can allow access from specific IP addresses or from specific virtual networks (using network service endpoints).
Configure public access when creating a namespace
To enable public access, selectPublic accesson theNetworkingpage of the namespace creation wizard.

After you create the namespace, selectNetworkingon the left menu of theService Bus Namespacepage. You see thatAll Networksoption is selected. You can selectSelected Networksoption and allow access from specific IP addresses or specific virtual networks. The next section provides you details on specifying the networks from which the access is allowed.
Configure selected networks for an existing namespace
This section shows you how to use Azure portal to add a virtual network service endpoint. To limit access, you need to integrate the virtual network service endpoint for this Event Hubs namespace.

Use Resource Manager template
The following sample Resource Manager template adds a virtual network rule to an existing Service Bus namespace. For the network rule, it specifies the ID of a subnet in a virtual network.
The ID is a fully qualified Resource Manager path for the virtual network subnet. For example,/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet}/subnets/defaultfor the default subnet of a virtual network.
/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet}/subnets/default

If there are no IP and virtual network rules, all the traffic flows into the namespace even if you set thedefaultActiontodeny.  The namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key). Specify at least one IP rule or virtual network rule for the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network.

The default value of thedefaultActionproperty wasDenyfor API version2021-01-01-preview and earlier. However, the deny rule isn't enforced unless you set IP filters or virtual network rules. That is, if you didn't have any IP filters or virtual network rules, it's treated asAllow.
defaultAction
Deny
Allow
From API version2021-06-01-preview onwards, the default value of thedefaultActionproperty isAllow, to accurately reflect the service-side enforcement. If the default action is set toDeny, IP filters and virtual network rules are enforced. If the default action is set toAllow, IP filters and virtual network rules aren't enforced. The service remembers the rules when you turn them off and then back on again.
