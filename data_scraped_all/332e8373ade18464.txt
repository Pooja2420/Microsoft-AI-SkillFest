Create a virtual machine with a static private IP address
Article

When you create a virtual machine (VM), it's automatically assigned a private IP address from a range that you specify. This IP address is based on the subnet in which the VM is deployed, and the VM keeps this address until the VM is deleted. Azure dynamically assigns the next available private IP address from the subnet you create a VM in. If you want to assign a specific IP address in this subnet for your VM, use a static IP address.

Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Use the following steps to create a resource group and a virtual machine.
Create a resource group
The following command creates a resource group withNew-AzResourceGroup.
## Create resource group. ##
$rg =@{
    Name = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
}
New-AzResourceGroup @rg
## Create resource group. ##
$rg =@{
    Name = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
}
New-AzResourceGroup @rg
Create a virtual machine
The following command creates a Windows Server virtual machine withNew-AzVM. When prompted, provide a username and password to be used as the credentials for the virtual machine:
## Create virtual machine. ##
$vm = @{
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'East US 2'
    Name = 'myVM'
    PublicIpAddressName = 'myPublicIP'
}
New-AzVM @vm
## Create virtual machine. ##
$vm = @{
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'East US 2'
    Name = 'myVM'
    PublicIpAddressName = 'myPublicIP'
}
New-AzVM @vm
Use the following steps to create a resource group and a virtual machine.
Create a resource group
The following command creates a resource group withaz group create:
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus2
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus2
Create a virtual machine
The following command creates a Windows Server virtual machine withaz vm create. When prompted, provide a username and password to be used as the credentials for the virtual machine:
az vm create \
    --name myVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --public-ip-address myPublicIP \
    --public-ip-sku Standard \
    --image MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2019-Datacenter:latest \

UnderAssignment, selectStatic. Change the privateIP addressif you want a different one, and then selectSave.
Warning
If you change the private IP address, the VM associated with the network interface will be restarted to utilize the new IP address.
From within the operating system of a VM, avoid associating a staticprivateIP address on an Azure VM. Only assign a static private IP when it's necessary, such as whenassigning many IP addresses to VMs.
If you manually set the private IP address within the operating system, make sure it matches the private IP address assigned to the Azurenetwork interface. Otherwise, you can lose connectivity to the VM. For more information, seeprivate IP address settings.
Azure PowerShell cmdlets used to change the private IP address to static are as follows:
Get-AzVirtualNetwork
Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig
Get-AzNetworkInterface
Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig
Set-AzNetworkInterface
With the following commands, you change the private IP address of the virtual machine tostatic:
## Place virtual network configuration into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myVM'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

## Place subnet configuration into a variable. ##
$sub = @{
    Name = 'myVM'
    VirtualNetwork = $vnet
}
$subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

## Get name of network interface and place into a variable ##
$int1 = @{
    Name = 'myVM'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vm = Get-AzVM @int1

## Place network interface configuration into a variable. ##
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceId $vm.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces.Id

## Set interface configuration. ##
$config =@{
    Name = 'myVM'
    PrivateIpAddress = '192.168.1.4'
    Subnet = $subnet
}
$nic | Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig @config -Primary

## Save interface configuration. ##
$nic | Set-AzNetworkInterface
## Place virtual network configuration into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myVM'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

## Place subnet configuration into a variable. ##
$sub = @{
    Name = 'myVM'
    VirtualNetwork = $vnet
}
$subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

## Get name of network interface and place into a variable ##
$int1 = @{
    Name = 'myVM'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vm = Get-AzVM @int1

## Place network interface configuration into a variable. ##
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceId $vm.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces.Id

## Set interface configuration. ##

    Name = 'myVM'
    PrivateIpAddress = '192.168.1.4'
    Subnet = $subnet

$nic | Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig @config -Primary

## Save interface configuration. ##
$nic | Set-AzNetworkInterface
Warning
From within the operating system of a VM, you shouldn't statically assign theprivateIP that's assigned to the Azure VM. Only do static assignment of a private IP when it's necessary, such as whenassigning many IP addresses to VMs.
If you manually set the private IP address within the operating system, make sure it matches the private IP address assigned to the Azurenetwork interface. Otherwise, you can lose connectivity to the VM. Learn more aboutprivate IP addresssettings.
Useaz network nic ip-config updateto update the network interface configuration.
With the following commands, you change the private IP address of the virtual machine tostatic:
az network nic ip-config update \
    --name ipconfigmyVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --nic-name myVMVMNic \
    --private-ip-address 10.0.0.4
az network nic ip-config update \
    --name ipconfigmyVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
