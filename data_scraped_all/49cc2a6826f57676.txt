This article shows you how to deploy and run theChat with your data sample for Java. This sample implements a chat app using Java, Azure OpenAI Service, andRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)in Azure AI Search to get answers about employee benefits at a fictitious company. The app is seeded with PDF files including the employee handbook, a benefits document, and a list of company roles and expectations.
Demo video
In this article, you accomplish the following tasks:
Deploy a chat app to Azure.
Get answers about employee benefits.
Change settings to change behavior of responses.
Once you complete this article, you can start modifying the new project with your custom code.
This article is part of a collection of articles that show you how to build a chat app using Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search. Other articles in the collection include:
.NET
JavaScript
Python
Note
This article uses one or moreAI app templatesas the basis for the examples and guidance in the article. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference implementations that help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.
Architectural overview
A simple architecture of the chat app is shown in the following diagram:

Key components of the architecture include:
A web application to host the interactive chat experience.
An Azure AI Search resource to get answers from your own data.
An Azure OpenAI Service to provide:Keywords to enhance the search over your own data.Answers from the OpenAI model.Embeddings from the ada model
Keywords to enhance the search over your own data.
Answers from the OpenAI model.

Cost
Most resources in this architecture use a basic or consumption pricing tier. Consumption pricing is based on usage, which means you only pay for what you use. To complete this article, there's a charge but it's minimal. When you're done with the article, you can delete the resources to stop incurring charges.

Use chat app to get answers from PDF files
The chat app is preloaded with employee benefits information fromPDF files. You can use the chat app to ask questions about the benefits. The following steps walk you through the process of using the chat app.
In the browser, select or enterWhat is included in my Northwind Health Plus plan that is not in standard?in the chat text box.

Use chat app settings to change behavior of responses
The OpenAI model and the settings that are used to interact with the model determine the intelligence of the chat app.

Use semantic ranker
Use query-contextual summaries
The following steps walk you through the process of changing the settings.
In the browser, select theDeveloper Settingstab.

2. Are preventive care services subject to the deductible?
3. How does the prescription drug deductible work?

What is the difference in the answers?For example the response, which used the Semantic ranker provided a single answer:The deductible for the Northwind Health Plus plan is $2,000 per year.The response without semantic ranking returned an answer, which required more work to get the answer:Based on the information provided, it is unclear what your specific deductible is. The Northwind Health Plus plan has different deductible amounts for in-network and out-of-network services, and there is also a separate prescription drug deductible. I would recommend checking with your provider or referring to the specific benefits details for your plan to determine your deductible amount.

Clean up resources
Clean up Azure resources
The Azure resources created in this article are billed to your Azure subscription. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete them to avoid incurring more charges. Use the following command to delete the Azure resources and remove the source code:
azd down --purge

You aren't necessarily required to clean up your local environment, but you can stop the running development container and return to running Visual Studio Code in the context of a local workspace.
Open theCommand Palette, search for theDev Containerscommands, and then selectDev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally.

Tip
Visual Studio Code stops the running development container, but the container still exists in Docker in a stopped state. You can always delete the container instance, container image, and volumes from Docker to free up more space on your local machine.
How is the question answered?
The app is separated out into two apps:
A front-end JavaScript application using the React framework with the Vite build tool.
A back-end Java application answers the question.
The backend/chatAPI steps through the process of getting the answer:
/chat
Build RAG options: Create a set of options used to generate an answer.
Create approach using RAG options: Use a combination of retrieval-based and generative-based models to create an approach for generating an accurate and natural-sounding response.
Run the approach with RAG options and previous conversation: Use the approach and RAG options to generate an answer based on the previous conversation. The answer includes information about which documents were used to generate the response.
