Showmount on NFS clients has historically been how users can see exported file systems on an NFS server. By default, Azure NetApp Files enables showmount functionality to show exported paths but doesn't list the allowed client access. Instead, showmount displays that (everyone) has access. The setting allows NFS clients to use theshowmount -ecommand to see a list of exports available on the Azure NetApp Files NFS-enabled storage endpoint.
showmount -e
This functionality might cause security scanners to flag the Azure NetApp Files NFS service as having a vulnerability because these scanners often use showmount to see what is being returned. In those scenarios, you might want to disable showmount on Azure NetApp Files.
Some applications, however, make use of showmount for functionality, such as Oracle OVM. In those scenarios, inform the security team of the application requirements.
The disable showmount capability is currently in preview. If you're using this feature for the first time, you need to register the feature first. By registering the feature, you disable the showmount. By unregistering the feature, you enable the showmount.
