ISO/IEC 27017:2015 overview
TheISO/IEC 27017:2015code of practice is designed for organizations to use as a reference for selecting cloud services information security controls when implementing a cloud computing information security management system based on ISO/IEC 27002:2013. It can also be used by cloud service providers as a guidance document for implementing commonly accepted protection controls.
This international standard provides additional cloud-specific implementation guidance based on ISO/IEC 27002:2013, and provides additional controls to address cloud-specific information security threats and risks as detailed in clauses 5-18 in ISO/IEC 27002:2013 for controls, implementation guidance, and other information. Specifically, this standard provides guidance on 37 controls in ISO/IEC 27002:2013, and it also features seven new controls that aren't duplicated in ISO/IEC 27002:2013. These new controls address the following important areas:
Shared roles and responsibilities within a cloud computing environment
Removal and return of cloud service customer assets upon contract termination
Protection and separation of a customer's virtual environment from environments of other customers
Virtual machine hardening requirements to meet business needs
Procedures for administrative operations of a cloud computing environment
Enabling customers to monitor relevant activities within a cloud computing environment
Alignment of security management for virtual and physical networks
ISO/IEC 27017:2015 is unique in providing guidance for both cloud service providers and cloud service customers. It also provides cloud service customers with practical information on what they should expect from cloud service providers. Customers can benefit directly from ISO/IEC 27017:2015 by ensuring they understand the shared responsibilities in the cloud.

Frequently asked questions
To whom does ISO/IEC 27017 apply?The ISO/IEC 27017 code of practice provides controls and implementation guidance for both cloud service providers and cloud service customers. It is structured in a format similar to ISO/IEC 27002.
How can I get the Azure ISO/IEC 27017 audit documentation?For links to audit documentation, seeAudit reports and certificates.
Can I use the Azure ISO/IEC 27017 compliance assurances in my organizationâs certification process?Yes. If your business is seeking certification for an implementation deployed using in-scope services, you can use the relevant Azure certifications in your compliance assessment. However, you're responsible for engaging an assessor to evaluate your implementation for compliance and for the controls and processes within your own organization.
