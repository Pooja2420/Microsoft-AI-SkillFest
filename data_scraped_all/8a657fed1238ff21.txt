Managed identities provide Azure services with a secure, automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID. Using managed identities eliminates the need for developers to manage credentials by providing an identity. There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned. The de-identification service supports both.
Managed identities can be used to grant the de-identification service access to your storage account for batch processing. In this article, you learn how to assign a managed identity to your de-identification service.
Prerequisites
Understand the differences betweensystem-assignedanduser-assignedmanaged identities, described inWhat are managed identities for Azure resources?
A de-identification service in your Azure subscription. If you don't have a de-identification service, follow the steps inQuickstart: Deploy the de-identification service.
Create an instance of the de-identification service in Azure Health Data Services with a system-assigned managed identity
Azure portal
ARM template
Access the de-identification service settings in the Azure portal under theSecuritygroup in the left navigation pane.
SelectIdentity.
Within theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOnand chooseSave.
Any resource of typeMicrosoft.HealthDataAIServices/deidServicescan be created with a system-assigned identity by including the following block in
the resource definition:
Microsoft.HealthDataAIServices/deidServices
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
Assign a user-assigned managed identity to a service instance
Azure portal
ARM template
Create a user-assigned managed identity resource according tothese instructions.
In the navigation pane of your de-identification service, scroll to theSecuritygroup.
SelectIdentity.
Select theUser assignedtab, and then chooseAdd.
Search for the identity you created, select it, and then chooseAdd.
Any resource of typeMicrosoft.HealthDataAIServices/deidServicescan be created with a user-assigned identity by including the following block in
the resource definition, replacingresource-idwith the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) resource ID of the desired identity:
Microsoft.HealthDataAIServices/deidServices
"identity": {
    "type": "UserAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "<resource-id>": {}
    }
}
"identity": {
    "type": "UserAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "<resource-id>": {}
    }
}
Supported scenarios using managed identities
Managed identities assigned to the de-identification service can be used to allow access to Azure Blob Storage for batch de-identification jobs. The service acquires a token as the managed identity to access Blob Storage, and de-identify blobs that match a specified pattern. For more information, including how to grant access to your managed identity, seeQuickstart: Azure Health De-identification client library for .NET.
Clean-up steps
When you remove a system-assigned identity, you delete it from Microsoft Entra ID. System-assigned identities are also automatically removed from Microsoft Entra ID
when you delete the de-identification service, described as follows.
Azure portal
ARM template
In the navigation pane of your de-identification service, scroll down to theSecuritygroup.
SelectIdentity, then follow the steps based on the identity type:System-assigned identity: Within theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOff, and then chooseSave.User-assigned identity: Select theUser assignedtab, select the checkbox for the identity, and selectRemove. SelectYesto confirm.
System-assigned identity: Within theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOff, and then chooseSave.
User-assigned identity: Select theUser assignedtab, select the checkbox for the identity, and selectRemove. SelectYesto confirm.
Any resource of typeMicrosoft.HealthDataAIServices/deidServicescan have system-assigned identities deleted and user-assigned identities unassigned by
including this block in the resource definition:
Microsoft.HealthDataAIServices/deidServices
"identity": {
    "type": "None"
}
"identity": {
    "type": "None"
}
