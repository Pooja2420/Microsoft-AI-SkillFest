Azure OpenAI Service REST API preview reference

This article provides details on the inference REST API endpoints for Azure OpenAI.
API specs
Managing and interacting with Azure OpenAI models and resources is divided across three primary API surfaces:
Control plane
Data plane - authoring
Data plane - inference
Each API surface/specification encapsulates a different set of Azure OpenAI capabilities. Each API has its own unique set of preview and stable/generally available (GA) API releases. Preview releases currently tend to follow a monthly cadence.

Authentication
Azure OpenAI provides two methods for authentication. You can use  either API Keys or Microsoft Entra ID.
API Key authentication: For this type of authentication, all API requests must include the API Key in theapi-keyHTTP header. TheQuickstartprovides guidance for how to make calls with this type of authentication.

api-key
Microsoft Entra ID authentication: You can authenticate an API call using a Microsoft Entra token. Authentication tokens are included in a request as theAuthorizationheader. The token provided must be preceded byBearer, for exampleBearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN. You can read our how-to guide onauthenticating with Microsoft Entra ID.

Bearer
Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
REST API versioning
The service APIs are versioned using theapi-versionquery parameter. All versions follow the YYYY-MM-DD date structure. For example:
api-version
POST https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/chat/completions?api-version=2024-06-01
POST https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/chat/completions?api-version=2024-06-01
Data plane inference
The rest of the article covers the latest preview release of the Azure OpenAI data plane inference specification,2025-03-01-preview. This article includes documentation for the latest preview capabilities like assistants, threads, and vector stores.

Setting to{ "type": "json_object" }enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
{ "type": "json_object" }
Important:when using JSON mode, youmustalso instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off iffinish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceededmax_tokensor the conversation exceeded the max context length.

assistantStreamEvent

event
data
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emitthread.run.createdwhen a new run
is created,thread.run.completedwhen a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
to create a message during a run, we emit athread.message.created event, athread.message.in_progressevent, manythread.message.deltaevents, and finally athread.message.completedevent.
thread.run.created
thread.run.completed
thread.message.created event
thread.message.in_progress
thread.message.delta
thread.message.completed
We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
in your code.

ResponseModalities
Output types that you would like the model to generate.
Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:
["text"]
["text"]
Thegpt-4o-audio-previewmodel can also be used to
generate audio. To request that this model generate
both text and audio responses, you can use:
gpt-4o-audio-preview
["text", "audio"]
["text", "audio"]
No properties defined for this component.
ResponseModalitiesTextOnly
Output types that you would like the model to generate.
Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The

This component can be one of the following:
TextResponseFormatConfiguration
An object specifying the format that the model must output.
Configuring{ "type": "json_schema" }enables Structured Outputs,
which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema.
{ "type": "json_schema" }
The default format is{ "type": "text" }with no additional options.
{ "type": "text" }
Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:
Setting to{ "type": "json_object" }enables the older JSON mode, which
ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Usingjson_schemais preferred for models that support it.
{ "type": "json_object" }
