This quickstart walks you through the steps to create an Azure DNS Private Resolver using the Azure portal. If you prefer, you can complete this quickstart usingAzure PowerShell.
Azure DNS Private Resolver enables you to query Azure DNS private zones from an on-premises environment, and vice versa, without deploying VM based DNS servers. You no longer need to provision IaaS based solutions on your virtual networks to resolve names registered on Azure private DNS zones. You can configure conditional forwarding of domains back to on-premises, multicloud and public DNS servers. For more information, including benefits, capabilities, and regional availability, seeWhat is Azure DNS Private Resolver.
In this article:
Two VNets are created:myvnetandmyvnet2.
An Azure DNS Private Resolver is created in the first VNet with an inbound endpoint at10.10.0.4.
A DNS forwarding ruleset is created for the private resolver.
The DNS forwarding ruleset is linked to the second VNet.
Example rules are added to the DNS forwarding ruleset.
This article doesn't demonstrate DNS forwarding to an on-premises network. For more information, seeResolve Azure and on-premises domains.
The following figure summarizes the setup used in this article:

Prerequisites
An Azure subscription is required.
If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can create afree account.
Register the Microsoft.Network provider namespace
Before you can useMicrosoft.Networkservices with your Azure subscription, you must register theMicrosoft.Networknamespace:
Select theSubscriptionblade in the Azure portal, and then choose your subscription.
UnderSettingsselectResource Providers.
SelectMicrosoft.Networkand then selectRegister.
Create a resource group
First, create or choose an existing resource group to host the resources for your DNS resolver. The resource group must be in asupported region. In this example, the location isWest Central US. To create a new resource group:
SelectCreate a resource group.
SelectCreate a resource group.
Select your subscription name, enter a name for the resource group, and choose a supported region.
Select your subscription name, enter a name for the resource group, and choose a supported region.
SelectReview + create, and then selectCreate.
SelectReview + create, and then selectCreate.

Create a virtual network
Next, add a virtual network to the resource group that you created, and configure subnets.
Select the resource group you created, selectCreate, selectNetworkingfrom the list of categories, and then next toVirtual network, selectCreate.

Link your forwarding ruleset to the second virtual network
To apply your forwarding ruleset to the second virtual network, you must create a virtual link.
Search forDNS forwarding rulesetsin the Azure services list and select your ruleset (ex:myruleset).
Search forDNS forwarding rulesetsin the Azure services list and select your ruleset (ex:myruleset).
SelectVirtual Network Links, selectAdd, choosemyvnet2and use the default Link Namemyvnet2-link.
SelectVirtual Network Links, selectAdd, choosemyvnet2and use the default Link Namemyvnet2-link.
SelectAddand verify that the link was added successfully.  You might need to refresh the page.
SelectAddand verify that the link was added successfully.  You might need to refresh the page.

Delete a virtual network link
Later in this article a rule is created using the private resolver inbound endpoint as a destination. This configuration can cause a DNS resolution loop if the VNet where the resolver is provisioned is also linked to the ruleset.  To fix this issue, remove the link tomyvnet.
Search forDNS forwarding rulesetsin the Azure services list and select your ruleset (ex:myruleset).
Search forDNS forwarding rulesetsin the Azure services list and select your ruleset (ex:myruleset).
SelectVirtual Network Links, choosemyvnet-link, selectRemoveand selectOK.
SelectVirtual Network Links, choosemyvnet-link, selectRemoveand selectOK.

Configure a DNS forwarding ruleset
Add or remove specific rules your DNS forwarding ruleset as desired, such as:
A rule to resolve an Azure Private DNS zone linked to your virtual network: azure.contoso.com.
A rule to resolve an on-premises zone: internal.contoso.com.
A wildcard rule to forward unmatched DNS queries to a protective DNS service.
Important
The rules shown in this quickstart are examples of rules that can be used for specific scenarios. None of the forwarding rules described in this article are required. Be careful to test your forwarding rules and ensure that the rules don't cause DNS resolution issues.If you include a wildcard rule in your ruleset, ensure that the target DNS service can resolve public DNS names. Some Azure services have dependencies on public name resolution.
Delete a rule from the forwarding ruleset
Individual rules can be deleted or disabled. In this example, a rule is deleted.
Search forDns Forwarding Rulesetsin the Azure Services list and select it.
Select the ruleset you previously configured (ex:myruleset) and then selectRules.
Select thecontosocomsample rule that you previously configured, selectDelete, and then selectOK.
Add rules to the forwarding ruleset
Add three new conditional forwarding rules to the ruleset.
On themyruleset | Rulespage, selectAdd, and enter the following rule data:Rule Name:AzurePrivateDomain Name:azure.contoso.com.Rule State:Enabled
On themyruleset | Rulespage, selectAdd, and enter the following rule data:
Rule Name:AzurePrivate
Domain Name:azure.contoso.com.
Rule State:Enabled
UnderDestination IP addressenter 10.0.0.4, and then selectAdd.
UnderDestination IP addressenter 10.0.0.4, and then selectAdd.
On themyruleset | Rulespage, selectAdd, and enter the following rule data:Rule Name:InternalDomain Name:internal.contoso.com.Rule State:Enabled
On themyruleset | Rulespage, selectAdd, and enter the following rule data:
Rule Name:Internal
Domain Name:internal.contoso.com.
Rule State:Enabled
UnderDestination IP addressenter 192.168.1.2, and then selectAdd.
UnderDestination IP addressenter 192.168.1.2, and then selectAdd.
On themyruleset | Rulespage, selectAdd, and enter the following rule data:Rule Name:WildcardDomain Name:.(enter only a dot)Rule State:Enabled
On themyruleset | Rulespage, selectAdd, and enter the following rule data:
Rule Name:Wildcard
Domain Name:.(enter only a dot)
Rule State:Enabled
UnderDestination IP addressenter 10.5.5.5, and then selectAdd.
UnderDestination IP addressenter 10.5.5.5, and then selectAdd.

In this example:
10.0.0.4 is the resolver's inbound endpoint.
192.168.1.2 is an on-premises DNS server.
10.5.5.5 is a protective DNS service.
Test the private resolver
You should now be able to send DNS traffic to your DNS resolver and resolve records based on your forwarding rulesets, including:
Azure DNS private zones linked to the virtual network where the resolver is deployed.If a VNet is linked to the private zone itself, it doesn't need a rule for the private zone in the forwarding ruleset. Resources in the VNet can directly resolve the zone. However, in this example, the second VNet isn't linked to the private zone. It can still resolve the zone by using the forwarding ruleset. For more information about this design, seePrivate Resolver Architecture.
