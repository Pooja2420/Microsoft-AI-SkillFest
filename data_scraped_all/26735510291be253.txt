Common use cases for DLT include data ingestion from sources such as cloud storage (such as Amazon S3, Azure ADLS Gen2, and Google Cloud Storage) and message buses (such as Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub, Azure EventHub, and Apache Pulsar), and incremental batch and streaming transformations.
