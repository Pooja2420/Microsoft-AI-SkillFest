To manage work tracking effectively, assign specific permissions to users or groups for particularobjects, projects, or collections. You can alsodefine custom rulesfor processes or projects that apply to specific users or groups, controlling their actions accordingly. For most features, we recommend adding users to the project'sContributorsgroup, which grants comprehensive access and ensures a seamless and efficient work tracking experience.
Note
For public projects, Stakeholder access gives users greater access to work tracking features and full access to Azure Pipelines. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.
Prerequisites

Understand roles and permission levels for work tracking
The following table summarizes the different permissions you can set at the object, project, or collection level. The team administrator role provides access to add and modify team resources. Also, see Default permissions for Boards, Backlogs, Sprints, Delivery Plans, Test Management, and Queries, further in this article.

Create child nodes, modify work items under an area or iteration path
Area path permissions let you manage access to edit or modify work items, test cases, or test plans assigned to those areas. You can restrict access to users or groups. You can also set permissions for who can add or modify areas or iterations for the project.
Note
Project members with permissions to create or editArea PathsorIteration Pathscan't set teamArea PathsandIteration Paths. To configure team settings, be added to theteam administrator roleor be a member of theProject Administratorsgroup.
Do the following steps to define both areas and iterations for a project.

Note
Work items are subject to rules applied to them. Conditional rules based on user or group membership are cached for your web browser. If you find yourself restricted to update a work item, you may have encountered one of these rules. If you believe you've encountered an issue that doesn't apply to you, seeWork item form IndexDB caching issues. For more information, seeRules and rule evaluation.
Use custom rules
Custom rules don't control permissions, but they affect whether a user can modify a work item or set the value of a work item field. Azure Boards supports the following work tracking customizations that support business workflows.
There are some restrictions for applying custom rules to system fields. For example, you can't specify rules that set or clear the value forArea PathorIteration Pathas they're system fields. For more information, seeRules and rule evaluationandSample rule scenarios.

Set permissions on queries or query folders
You can specify who can add or edit query folders or queries at the object-level.
To manage permissions for a query or query folder, be the creator of the query or folder, a member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators group or granted explicit access through the object'sSecuritydialog.
Query folder permissions dialog


For more information, seeCreate managed queries to list, update, or chart work items.
Default permissions for queries
Tip
By default, Contributors can't create and save shared queries. We recommend that Project Administrators create a query folder for each team and give the team administrators or the team group query permissions to manage their folder. You needDeletepermissions to rename or move a shared query or folder, andContributepermissions for the folder where you move the query to. For more information, seeSet permissions on queries and query folders.

Set permissions for work item tags
By default, all users of the Contributors group can create and add tags to work items. To set permissions for a group or user to restrict this ability, you can set theCreate tag definitiontoDenyat the project-level. To learn how, seeChange the permission level for a project-level group.

Manage permissions for Delivery Plans
Delivery Plans are an object within a project. You can manage permissions for each plan like the way you manage permissions for shared queries or query folders. The creator of a Delivery Plan and all members of the Project Collection Administrators and Project Administrators groups have permissions to edit, manage, and delete plans.
Users grantedStakeholderaccess for private projects have no access to delivery plans, while users grantedStakeholderaccess for public projects has the same access as regular Contributors grantedBasicaccess. For a comparison chart of Stakeholder versus basic access, see theFeature Matrix.
To edit the permissions for a Delivery Plan, be the creator of the plan, a member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators group, or granted explicit permission through the plan'sSecuritydialog.

Move or permanently delete work items
By default, Project Administrators and Contributors can change the work item type and delete work items by moving them to theRecycle Bin. Only Project Administrators can permanently delete work items and test artifacts. Project admins can grant permissions to other team members as needed.
For example, as a project admin you can grant a user, team group, or other group you've created to have these permissions. Open the Security page for the project and choose the user or group you want to grant permissions. To learn how to access project-levelSecurity, seeChange project-level permissions.
Note
TheMove work items out of this projectpermission requires theInherited process modelfor the project.
In the following example, we granted members who are assigned to the team administrator role, and who belong to the Team Admin group, permissions to move work items to another project and permanently delete work items.


Manage test plans and test suites
In addition to the project-level permissions set in the previous section, team members need permissions to manage test artifacts that are set for an area path.
Open theSecuritypage for area pathsand choose the user or group you want to grant permissions.

Set the permissions forManage test plansandManage test suitestoAllow.

To have full access to the Test feature set, youraccess level must be set to Basic + Test Plans. Users with Basic access and with permissions to permanently delete work items and manage test artifacts can only delete orphaned test cases.
Default permissions for test management
Test plans, test suites, test cases and other test artifacts are specific work item types that support manual and exploratory testing. For more information, seeSet test permissions at the project level.

Customize an inherited process
By default, only Project Collection Administrators can create and edit processes. However, these admins can grant permissions to other team members by explicitly setting theCreate process,Delete process, orEdit processpermissions at the collection level for a specific user.
To customize a process, you need to grantEdit processpermissions to a user account for the specific process.
Note
Users added to theProject-Scoped Usersgroup can't access Process settings if theLimit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectspreview feature is enabled for the organization. For more information including important security-related callouts, seeManage your organization, Limit  user visibility for projects and more.

Note
Processes are securable entities with distinct ACLs for creation, editing, and deletion.Project Collection Administratorsat the collection level determine the inherited processes. New inherited processes grant full control to the creator and Project Collection Administrators, who can also assign ACLs to others for process management.
More access options for work items
For more information about options for customizing work item types to support restrictions, seeRestrict access, Restrict modification of work items based on a user or group.
Grant team members additional permissions
For teams to work autonomously, you may want to provide them with permissions that they don't have by default. Suggested tasks include providing team administrators or team leads permissions to:
Create and edit child nodes under their default area path
Create and edit child nodes under an existing iteration node
Create shared queries and folders under the Shared Queries folder.
By default, team members inherit the permissions afforded to members of the project Contributors group. Members of this group can add and modify source code, create and delete test runs, and create and modify work items. They cancollaborate on a Git projector collaborate with other team members andcheck in work to the team's code base (TFVC).

If your on-premises deployment includes reporting, add users to those resources. SeeGrant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports.
