A search job is an asynchronous query you run on any data in your Log Analytics - in bothinteractive and long-term retention- that makes the query results available for interactive queries in a new search table within your workspace. The search job uses parallel processing and can run for hours across large datasets. This article describes how to create a search job and how to query its resulting data.
This video explains when and how to use search jobs:

Note
Cross-tenant search jobs are not currently supported, even when Entra ID tenants are managed through Azure Lighthouse.
When to use search jobs
Use search jobs to:
Retrieve records fromlong-term retentionandtables with the Basic and Auxiliary plansinto a new Analytics table where you can take advantage of Azure Monitor Log's full analytics capabilities.
Scan through large volumes of data, if the log query timeout of 10 minutes isn't sufficient.
What does a search job do?
A search job sends its results to a new table in the same workspace as the source data. The results table is available as soon as the search job begins, but it may take time for results to begin to appear.
The search job results table is anAnalytics tablethat is available for log queries and other Azure Monitor features that use tables in a workspace. The table uses theretention valueset for the workspace, but you can modify this value after the table is created.
The search results table schema is based on the source table schema and the specified query. The following other columns help you track the source records:
Queries on the results table appear inlog query auditingbut not the initial search job.
Run a search job
Run a search job to fetch records from large datasets into a new search results table in your workspace.
Tip
You incur charges for running a search job. Therefore, write and optimize your query in interactive query mode before running the search job.

To check the status and details of a search job table, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace table showcommand.

To check the status and details of a search job table, run theGet-AzOperationalInsightsTablecommand.
Example
Get-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName "ContosoRG" -WorkspaceName "ContosoWorkspace" -tableName "HeartbeatByIp_SRCH"
Get-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName "ContosoRG" -WorkspaceName "ContosoWorkspace" -tableName "HeartbeatByIp_SRCH"
Note
When "-TableName" is not provided, the command will instead list all tables associated with a workspace.
Delete a search job table
We recommend youdelete the search job tablewhen you're done querying the table. This reduces workspace clutter and extra charges for data retention.
Limitations
Search jobs are subject to the following limitations:
Optimized to query one table at a time.
Search date range is up to one year.
Supports long running searches up to a 24-hour time-out.
Results are limited to one million records in the record set.
Concurrent execution is limited to five search jobs per workspace.
Limited to 100 search results tables per workspace.
Limited to 100 search job executions per day per workspace.
When you reach the record limit, Azure aborts the job with a status ofpartial success, and the table contains only records ingested up to that point.
KQL query limitations
Search jobs are intended to scan large volumes of data in a specific table. Therefore, search job queries must always start with a table name. To enable asynchronous execution using distribution and segmentation, the query supports a subset of KQL, including the operators:
where
extend
project
project-away
project-keep
project-rename
project-reorder
parse
parse-where
You can use all functions and binary operators within these operators.
Pricing model
The search job charge is based on:
Search job execution:Analytics plan- The amount of data the search job scans that's in long-term retention. There's no charge for scanning data that's in interactive retention in Analytics tables.Basic or Auxiliary plans- All data the search job scans in both interactive and long-term retention.The data scanned is defined as the volume of data that was ingested within the time range specified by the query for the table which is being queried.   For more information about interactive and long-term retention, seeManage data retention in a Log Analytics workspace.

Search job results - The amount of data the search job finds and is ingested into the results table, based on the data ingestion rate for Analytics tables.
For example, if a search on a Basic table spans 30 days and the table holds 500 GB of data per day, you're charged for 15,000 GB of scanned data. If the search job returns 1,000 records, you're charged for ingesting these 1,000 records into the results table.
Note
Billing for search jobs on an Auxiliary Logs table is not enabled at this time.
Details on billing start date will be announced onAzure Updates.
For more information, seeAzure Monitor pricing.
