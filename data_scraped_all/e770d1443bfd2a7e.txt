In this article, you learn how to migrate your existing connection monitors from Connection monitor (classic) to the new Connection monitor with zero downtime. For more information, seeConnection monitor overview.
Important
Connection monitor (Classic) is deprecated and no longer available. To minimize service disruption to your current workloads, migrate from Connection monitor (classic) to the new Connection monitor.
Key benefits of the new Connection monitor
The following are key benefits of the new Connection monitor:
Unified connectivity monitoring experience for Azure andâ¯Hybrid endpointsVirtual machines (VMs) and scale sets support as source and destination endpoints.Azure Monitor agent enabled ARC servers as source and destination endpoints.Cross subscription, cross workspace and cross region monitoring support.

Connection monitor (classic) vs new Connection monitor
The following table compares Connection monitor (classic) and the new Connection monitor:
Key points to note
The migration helps produce the following results:
Agents and firewall settings work as is. No changes are required.
Existing connection monitors are mapped to Connection monitor > Test group > Test format. By selectingEdit, you can view and modify the properties of the new Connection monitor, download a template to make changes to Connection monitor, and submit it via Azure Resource Manager.
Azure virtual machines with the Network Watcher extension send data to both the workspace and the metrics. Connection monitor makes the data available through the new metricsChecksFailedPercentandRoundTripTimeMsinstead of the old metricsProbesFailedPercentandAverageRoundtripMsrespectively.

Prerequisites
If you're using a custom workspace, ensure that Network Watcher is enabled in your subscription and in the region of your Log Analytics workspace. If not, you get an error stating "Before you attempt to migrate, please enable Network watcher extension in the subscription and location of LA workspace selected."
In case virtual machines used as sources in Connection monitor (classic) no longer have the Network Watcher extension enabled, you get an error message stating "Connection monitors having following tests cannot be imported as one or more Azure virtual machines don't have network watcher extension installed. Install Network Watcher extension and click refresh to import them."
Migrate the connection monitors
To migrate the older connection monitors to the new Connection monitor, selectConnection monitor, and then selectMigrate Connection Monitors.
To migrate the older connection monitors to the new Connection monitor, selectConnection monitor, and then selectMigrate Connection Monitors.

Select your subscription and the connection monitors you want to migrate, and then selectMigrate selected.
Select your subscription and the connection monitors you want to migrate, and then selectMigrate selected.
You can now customize Connection monitor properties, change the default workspace, download templates, and check the migration status.
After the migration begins, the following changes take place:
The Azure Resource Manager resource changes to the newer connection monitor:The name, region, and subscription of the connection monitor remain unchanged. The resource ID is unaffected.Unless the connection monitor is customized, a default Log Analytics workspace is created in the subscription and in the region of the connection monitor. This workspace is where monitoring data is stored. The test result data is also stored in the metrics.Each test is migrated to a test group calleddefaultTestGroup.Source and destination endpoints are created and used in the new test group. The default names aredefaultSourceEndpointanddefaultDestinationEndpoint.The destination port and probing interval are moved to a test configuration calleddefaultTestConfiguration. The protocol is set based on the port values. Success thresholds and other optional properties are left blank.

Metrics alerts are migrated to Connection monitor metrics alerts. The metrics are different, hence the change. For more information, seeMetrics in Azure Monitor.
The migrated connection monitors are no longer displayed as the older connection monitor solution. They're now available for use only in Connection monitor.
Any external integrations, such as dashboards in Power BI and Grafana, and integrations with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, must be migrated manually. This is the only manual step you need to perform to migrate your setup.
Common errors encountered
