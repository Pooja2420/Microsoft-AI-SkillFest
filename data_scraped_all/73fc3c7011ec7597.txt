Examples
Use database() to access table of other database
Run the query
database('Samples').StormEvents | count
database('Samples').StormEvents | count
Output
Use database() inside let statements
The query above can be rewritten as a query-defined function (let statement) that
receives a parameterdbName- which is passed into the database() function.
dbName
let foo = (dbName:string)
{
    database(dbName).StormEvents | count
};
foo('help')
let foo = (dbName:string)
{
    database(dbName).StormEvents | count
};
foo('help')
Output
Use database() inside stored functions
The same query as above can be rewritten to be used in a function that
receives a parameterdbName- which is passed into the database() function.
dbName
.create function foo(dbName:string)
{
    database(dbName).StormEvents | count
};
.create function foo(dbName:string)
{
    database(dbName).StormEvents | count
};
Note
Such functions can be used only locally and not in the cross-cluster query.
