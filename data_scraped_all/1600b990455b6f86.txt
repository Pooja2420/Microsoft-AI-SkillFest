Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list ofall platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor.
For information on metric retention, seeAzure Monitor Metrics overview.
Supported metrics for Microsoft.Search/searchServices
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Search/searchServices resource type.
All columns might not be present in every table.
Some columns might be beyond the viewing area of the page. SelectExpand tableto view all available columns.
Table headings
Category- The metrics group or classification.
Metric- The metric display name as it appears in the Azure portal.
Name in REST API- The metric name as referred to in theREST API.
Unit- Unit of measure.
Aggregation- The defaultaggregationtype. Valid values: Average (Avg), Minimum (Min), Maximum (Max), Total (Sum), Count.
Dimensions-Dimensionsavailable for the metric.
Time Grains-Intervalsat which the metric is sampled. For example,PT1Mindicates that the metric is sampled every minute,PT30Mevery 30 minutes,PT1Hevery hour, and so on.

PT30M
PT1H
DS Export- Whether the metric is exportable to Azure Monitor Logs via diagnostic settings. For information on exporting metrics, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.

ThrottledSearchQueriesPercentage
This metric shows the average of the search queries per second (QPS) for the search service. It's common for queries to execute in milliseconds, so only queries that measure as seconds appear in a metric like QPS. The minimum is the lowest value for search queries per second that was registered during that minute. Maximum is the highest value. Average is the aggregate across the entire minute.
For example, within one minute, you might have a pattern like this: one second of high load that is the maximum for SearchQueriesPerSecond, followed by 58 seconds of average load, and finally one second with only one query, which is the minimum.
Another example: if a node emits 100 metrics, where the value of each metric is 40, then "Count" is 100, "Sum" is 4000, "Average" is 40, and "Max" is 40.
Search latency indicates how long a query takes to complete.
This metric refers to queries that are dropped instead of processed. Throttling occurs when the number of requests in execution exceed capacity. You might see an increase in throttled requests when a replica is taken out of rotation or during indexing. Both query and indexing requests are handled by the same set of resources.
The service determines whether to drop requests based on resource consumption. The percentage of resources consumed across memory, CPU, and disk IO are averaged over a period of time. If this percentage exceeds a threshold, all requests to the index are throttled until the volume of requests is reduced.
Depending on your client, a throttled request is indicated in these ways:
A service returns an error"You are sending too many requests. Please try again later."
"You are sending too many requests. Please try again later."
A service returns a 503 error code indicating the service is currently unavailable.
If you're using the Azure portal (for example, Search Explorer), the query is dropped silently and you need to selectSearchagain.
To confirm throttled queries, useThrottled search queriesmetric. You can explore metrics in the Azure portal or create an alert metric as described in this article. For queries that were dropped within the sampling interval, useTotalto get the percentage of queries that didn't execute.
ForThrottled Search Queries Percentage, minimum, maximum, average and total, all have the same value: the percentage of search queries that were throttled, from the total number of search queries during one minute.
Metric dimensions
For information about what metric dimensions are, seeMulti-dimensional metrics.
Azure AI Search has dimensions associated with the following metrics that capture a count of documents or skills that were executed.
Resource logs
This section lists the types of resource logs you can collect for this service. The section pulls from the list ofall resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor.
Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Search/searchServices
OperationLogs
Logs from multiple Azure resources.
Azure Monitor Logs tables
This section lists the Azure Monitor Logs tables relevant to this service, which are available for query by Log Analytics using Kusto queries. The tables contain resource log data and possibly more depending on what is collected and routed to them.

Resource log tables
The following table lists the properties of resource logs in Azure AI Search. The resource logs are collected into Azure Monitor Logs or Azure Storage. In Azure Monitor, logs are collected in the AzureDiagnostics table under the resource provider name ofMicrosoft.Search.

Activity log
The linked table lists the operations that can be recorded in the activity log for this service. These operations are a subset ofall the possible resource provider operations in the activity log.
For more information on the schema of activity log entries, seeActivity Log schema.
The following table lists common operations related to Azure AI Search that may be recorded in the activity log. For a complete listing of all Microsoft.Search operations, seeMicrosoft.Search resource provider operations.
Common entries include references to API keys - generic informational notifications likeGet Admin KeyandGet Query keys. These activities indicate requests that were made using the admin key (create or delete objects) or query key, but don't show the request itself. For information of this grain, you must configure resource logging.
Alternatively, you might gain some insight through change history. In the Azure portal, select the activity to open the detail page and then select "Change history" for information about the underlying operation.

Other schemas
The following schemas are in use for this service.
If you're building queries or custom reports, the data structures that contain Azure AI Search resource logs conform to the following schemas.
For resource logs sent to blob storage, each blob has one root object calledrecordscontaining an array of log objects. Each blob contains records for all the operations that took place during the same hour.

Resource log schema
All resource logs available through Azure Monitor share acommon top-level schema. Azure AI Search supplements withmore propertiesandoperationsthat are unique to a search service.
The following example illustrates a resource log that includes common properties (TimeGenerated, Resource, Category, and so forth) and search-specific properties (OperationName and OperationVersion).
