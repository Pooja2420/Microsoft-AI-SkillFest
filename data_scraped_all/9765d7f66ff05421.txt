In this article
In this article, you use Visual Studio Code to create a Python function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions.
This article uses the Python v2 programming model for Azure Functions, which provides a decorator-based approach for creating functions. To learn more about the Python v2 programming model, see theDeveloper Reference Guide
Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.
There's also aCLI-based versionof this article.
This video shows you how to create a Python function in Azure using Visual Studio Code.
The steps in the video are also described in the following sections.
Configure your environment
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following requirements in place:
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.

Install or update Core Tools
The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.
In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the commandAzure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools.
This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must insteadmanually install or update Core Tools.
Create your local project
In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in Python. Later in this article, you publish your function code to Azure.
In Visual Studio Code, pressF1to open the command palette and search for and run the commandAzure Functions: Create New Project....

In the local.settings.json file, update theAzureWebJobsStoragesetting as in the following example:"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",This tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you're using an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.

Run the function locally
Visual Studio Code integrates withAzure Functions Core toolsto let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.
To start the function locally, pressF5or theRun and Debugicon in the left-hand side Activity bar. TheTerminalpanel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in theTerminalpanel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set toWSL Bash.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.
Sign in to Azure
Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.
If you aren't already signed in, in theActivity bar, select the Azure icon. Then underResources, selectSign in to Azure.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, selectCreate an Azure Account. Students can selectCreate an Azure for Students Account.

Create the function app in Azure
In this section, you create a function app and related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must insteadcreate your function app with advanced options.
In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (>), enter and then selectAzure Functions: Create Function App in Azure.

When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.Aresource group, which is a logical container for related resources.A standardAzure Storage account, which maintains state and other information about your projects.A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.TipBy default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group.

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,publish the project with advanced create options.
Deploy the project to Azure
Important
Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.
In the command palette, enter and then selectAzure Functions: Deploy to Function App.

Clean up resources
When you continue to thenext stepand add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.
Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.
In Visual Studio Code, pressF1to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and selectAzure: Open in portal.

Next steps
You created and deployed a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to a storage service in Azure. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, seeAdd bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions.
