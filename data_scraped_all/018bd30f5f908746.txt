Switch between HTML or Markdown on comments
Switch between HTML or Markdown on comments
A few months ago, weintroduced a private previewto enable Markdown for comments on work items, aiming to replace the existing HTML editor entirely. We've received your feedback, expressing a preference for the HTML editor and we adjusted our approach. You now have the flexibility to switch between the HTML and Markdown editor at the comment level.

Here's what you should expect:
The default editor is sticky from the last comment you created.
You can convert existing HTML comments to Markdown.
Once a Markdown comment is created or updated, it can't be converted to HTML.
This update is implemented across all pre-enrolled organizations and those with the New Boards Hub enabled by default. Additionally, we're extending the preview period for a few more weeks to gather more feedback. If you're interested in enrolling in the private preview, feel free to reach out directlyvia email, and kindly include your organization name (dev.azure.com/{organization}).
Tip
Consider enrolling in the preview only if your organization is fully committed to utilizing theNew Boards Hubfor all users. The experience with Markdown comments in the Old Boards may not be optimal.
