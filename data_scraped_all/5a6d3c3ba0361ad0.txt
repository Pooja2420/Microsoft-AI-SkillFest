Defender for Cloud provides real-time threat protection for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) containerized environments and generates alerts for suspicious activities. You can use this information to quickly remediate security issues and improve the security of your containers.
Threat protection at the cluster level is provided by the analysis of the Kubernetes audit logs.
Host-level threat detection for your Linux AKS nodes is available if you enableMicrosoft Defender for Serversand its Log Analytics agent. However, if your cluster is deployed on an Azure Kubernetes Service virtual machine scale set, the Log Analytics agent isn't currently supported.
