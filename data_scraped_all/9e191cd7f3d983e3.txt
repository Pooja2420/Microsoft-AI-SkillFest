Scenario details
This reference architecture shows how to connect an on-premises network to an Azure virtual network by using ExpressRoute, with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) as a failover connection. Traffic flows between the on-premises network and the Azure virtual network through an ExpressRoute connection. If there's a loss of connectivity in the ExpressRoute circuit, traffic is routed through an IPsec VPN tunnel.Deploy this solution.
If the ExpressRoute circuit is unavailable, the VPN route handles only private peering connections. Public peering and Microsoft peering connections pass over the Internet.
Recommendations
The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.
Connectivity providers
Select a suitable ExpressRoute connectivity provider for your location. To get a list of connectivity providers that are available at your location, use the following PowerShell command:
Get-AzExpressRouteServiceProvider

VPN and ExpressRoute gateways
If you already have an existing VPN virtual network gateway in your Azure virtual network, you can create an ExpressRoute virtual network gateway without needing to delete the existing virtual network gateway.
Follow the instructions inConfigure a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRouteto establish your ExpressRoute connection.
Follow the instructions inConfigure a hybrid network architecture with Azure and on-premises VPNto establish your VPN virtual network gateway connection.
After you establish the virtual network gateway connections, test the environment by following these steps:
Make sure you can connect from your on-premises network to your Azure virtual network.
Contact your provider to stop ExpressRoute connectivity for testing.
Verify that you can still connect from your on-premises network to your Azure virtual network using the VPN virtual network gateway connection.
Contact your provider to reestablish ExpressRoute connectivity.
Troubleshooting
If a previously functioning ExpressRoute circuit fails to connect and there are no configuration changes on-premises or within your private virtual network, you might need to contact the connectivity provider and work with them to correct the issue. Use the following PowerShell commands to verify that the ExpressRoute circuit is provisioned correctly:
Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name <circuit-name> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group>
Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name <circuit-name> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group>

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
ExpressRoute doesn't support router redundancy protocols like Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for high availability. Instead, it uses a redundant pair of BGP sessions per peering. To facilitate highly available connections to your network, Azure provisions two redundant ports on two routers (part of the Microsoft edge) in an active-active configuration.
By default, BGP sessions use an idle timeout value of 60 seconds. If a session times out three times (180 seconds total), the router is marked unavailable and all traffic is redirected to the remaining router. This 180-second timeout might be too long for critical applications. If you need to, you can change your BGP time-out settings on the on-premises router to a shorter duration. ExpressRoute also supportsBidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)over private peering. By enabling BFD over ExpressRoute, you can expedite link failure detection between Microsoft Enterprise edge (MSEE) devices and the routers on which you terminate the ExpressRoute circuit. You can terminate ExpressRoute over Customer Edge routing devices or Partner Edge routing devices (if you have a managed layer 3 connection service).
You can configure high availability for your Azure connection in different ways, depending on the type of provider you use and the number of ExpressRoute circuits and virtual network gateway connections you're willing to configure. Here's a summary of your availability options:
If you use a layer 2 connection, deploy redundant routers in your on-premises network in an active-active configuration. Connect the primary circuit to one router and the secondary circuit to the other. This configuration provides a highly available connection at both ends. This configuration is necessary if you require the ExpressRoute service-level agreement (SLA). SeeSLA for Azure ExpressRoutefor details.The following diagram shows a configuration with redundant on-premises routers connected to the primary and secondary circuits. Each circuit handles the traffic for private peering. (Each peering is designated a pair of /30 address spaces, as described in the previous section.)

If you require maximum resiliency, create multiple circuits to different peering locations. For high resiliency,ExpressRoute Metroprovides a single circuit with multiple peering locations.For each circuit, consider a different service provider to minimize the risk of network downtime by a single provider outage.

Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
You can configure security options for your Azure connection in different ways, depending on your security concerns and compliance needs.
ExpressRoute operates in layer 3. You can provide protection from threats in the application layer by using a network security appliance that restricts traffic to legitimate resources.
To maximize security, add network security appliances between the on-premises network and the provider edge routers. This helps to restrict the inflow of unauthorized traffic from the virtual network:

For auditing or compliance, you might need to block direct internet access for components that run in the virtual network and implement forced tunneling. In this situation, internet traffic should be redirected back through a proxy that's running on-premises, where it can be audited. You can configure the proxy to block unauthorized traffic from flowing out and filter potentially malicious inbound traffic.

To maximize security, don't enable a public IP address for your VMs, and use NSGs to help ensure that these VMs aren't publicly accessible. VMs should only be available via the internal IP address. You can make these addresses accessible through the ExpressRoute network, which enables on-premises DevOps staff to perform configuration or maintenance.
If you must expose management endpoints for VMs to an external network, use NSGs or access control lists to restrict the visibility of these ports to an allowlist of IP addresses or networks.
Note
Azure VMs deployed through the Azure portal can include a public IP address that provides sign-in access. However, it's a best practice to prohibit this access.
By default, traffic traversing an ExpressRoute connection is not encrypted. You can optionally configure encryption to be either Point-to-point encryption by MACsec or end-to-end encryption by IPsec; MACsec only available for ExpressRoute Direct. For more information, seeAbout encryption for Azure ExpressRoute.
To ensure your data hasn't been tampered with during transit, you can configure an MD5 hash on the ExpressRoute circuit during theconfiguration of private peering or Microsoft peeringto secure messages between the cross-premises route and the MSEE routers.
For more security considerations, seeAzure security baseline for ExpressRoute.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
For ExpressRoute cost considerations, see these articles:
Cost considerations in configuring a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure ExpressRoute.
In this architecture, an ExpressRoute circuit is used to join the on-premises network with Azure through the edge routers.
ExpressRoute offers two pricing plans. With the Metered Data plan, all inbound data transfer is free. All outbound data transfer is charged based on a predetermined rate.
With the Unlimited Data plan, all inbound and outbound data transfer is free. You're charged a fixed monthly port fee based on high availability dual ports.
Calculate your utilization and choose a billing plan accordingly. We recommend the Unlimited Data plan if you exceed about 68% of utilization.
For more information, seeAzure ExpressRoute pricing.
All application tiers are hosted in a single virtual network and are segmented into subnets.
Azure Virtual Network is free. For every subscription, you can create as many as 1,000 virtual networks across all regions. All traffic that occurs within the boundaries of a virtual network is free, so communication between two VMs in a single virtual network is free.

Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
ExpressRoute circuits provide a high-bandwidth path between networks. Generally, the higher the bandwidth, the higher the cost.
Note
Use theAzure Connectivity Toolkitto ensure the ExpressRoute gateway meets workload requirements.
ExpressRoute offers twopricing plans: the Metered Plan and the Unlimited Data plan. Charges vary according to circuit bandwidth. Available bandwidth will probably vary from provider to provider. Use theGet-AzExpressRouteServiceProvidercmdlet to see the providers available in your region and the bandwidths that they offer.
Get-AzExpressRouteServiceProvider
A single ExpressRoute circuit can support a certain number of peerings and virtual network links. SeeExpressRoute limitsfor more information.
The ExpressRoute Premium add-on provides:
Increased route limits for private peering.
An increased number of virtual network links per ExpressRoute circuit.
Global connectivity for services.
SeeExpressRoute pricingfor details.
Although some providers allow you to change your bandwidth, be sure to choose an initial bandwidth that surpasses your needs and provides room for growth. If you need to increase bandwidth in the future, you have two options:
Increase the bandwidth. Avoid this option as much as possible. Not all providers allow you to increase bandwidth dynamically. But if you need a bandwidth increase, check with your provider to ensure that they support changing ExpressRoute bandwidth properties by using PowerShell commands. If they do, run the following commands:$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name <circuit-name> -ResourceGroupName <resource-group>
$ckt.ServiceProviderProperties.BandwidthInMbps = <bandwidth-in-Mbps>
Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $cktYou can increase the bandwidth without loss of connectivity. Downgrading the bandwidth disrupts connectivity because you need to delete the circuit and re-create it with the new configuration.
