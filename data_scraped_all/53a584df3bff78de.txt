Application Insightscollects telemetry from your application to help diagnosing failures and investigating slow transactions. It includes two essential tools:
TheFailuresexperience, which tracks errors, exceptions, and faults, offering clear insights for fast problem-solving and enhanced stability.

ThePerformanceexperience, which quickly identifies and helps resolve application bottlenecks by displaying response times and operation counts.

Together, these tools ensure the ongoing health and efficiency of web applications. You can use them to pinpoint issues or enhancements that would have the most impact on users.

To get to theFailuresview in Application Insights, select either theFailed requestsgraph on theOverviewpane, orFailuresunder theInvestigatecategory in the resource menu.

You can also get to the failures view from theApplication Mapby selecting a resource, thenInvestigate failuresfrom the triage section.

Overview
Failures view
Performance view
TheFailuresview shows a list of all failed operations collected for your application with the option to drill into each one. It lets you view their frequency and the number of users affected, to help you focus your efforts on the issues with the highest impact.

ThePerformanceview shows a list of all operations collected for your application with the option to drill into each one. It lets you view their count and average duration, to help you focus your efforts on the issues with the highest impact.

Investigate

Performance view
To investigate the root cause of an error or exception, you can drill into the problematic operation for a detailed end-to-end transaction details view that includes dependencies and exception details.
Select an operation to view theTop 3 response codes,Top 3 exception types, andTop 3 failed dependenciesfor that operation.

End-to-end transaction details
TheEnd-to-end transaction detailsview shows a Gantt chart of the transaction, which lists all events with their duration and response code. Selecting a specific event reveals its properties, including additional information like the underlying command or call stack.

Debug Snapshot
To see code-level debug information of an exception:
Select the exception in the Gantt chart, thenOpen debug snapshot.
Select the exception in the Gantt chart, thenOpen debug snapshot.

Snapshot Debuggershows the call stack and allows you to inspect variables at each call stack frame. By selecting a method, you can view the values of all local variables at the time of the request.

Afterwards, you can debug the source code by downloading the snapshot and opening it in Visual Studio.

Create a work item
If you connect Application Insights to a tracking system such as Azure DevOps or GitHub, you can create a work item directly from Application Insights.
SelectCreate work itemand create a new template or pick an existing one.

Use analytics data
All data collected by Application Insights is stored inLog Analytics, which provides a rich query language to analyze the requests that generated the exception you're investigating.
Tip
Simple modein Log Analytics offers an intuitive point-and-click interface for analyzing and visualizing log data.
On either the performance or failures view, selectView in Logsin the top navigation bar and pick a query from the dropdown menu.

This takes you to theLogsview, where you can further modify the query or select a different one from the sidebar.

Profiler traces
The.NET Profilerhelps get further with code-level diagnostics by showing the actual code that ran for the operation and the time required for each step. Some operations might not have a trace because the Profiler runs periodically. Over time, more operations should have traces.
To start .NET Profiler, select an operation on thePerformanceview, then go toProfiler traces.Alternatively, you can do so on theend-to-end transaction detailsview.

Alternatively, you can do so on theend-to-end transaction detailsview.

The trace shows the individual events for each operation so that you can diagnose the root cause for the duration of the overall operation. Select one of the top examples that has the longest duration.

Analyze client-side performance and failures
If you instrument your web pages with Application Insights, you can gain visibility into page views, browser operations, and dependencies. Collecting this browser data requiresadding a script to your web pages.
After you add the script, you can access page views and their associated performance metrics by selecting theBrowsertoggle on thePerformanceorFailuresview.This view provides a visual summary of various telemetries of your application from the perspective of the browser.

For browser operations, theend-to-end transaction detailsview showsPage View Propertiesof the client requesting the page, including the type of browser and its location. This information can assist in determining whether there are performance issues related to particular types of clients.

Note
Like the data collected for server performance, Application Insights makes all client data available for deep analysis by using logs.
