This article describes how you plan for and manage costs forAzure AI Foundry. First, you use the Azure pricing calculator to help plan for Azure AI Foundry costs before you add any resources for the service to estimate costs. Next, as you add Azure resources, review the estimated costs.
Tip
Azure AI Foundry does not have a specific page in the Azure pricing calculator. Azure AI Foundry is composed of several other Azure services, some of which are optional. This article provides information on using the pricing calculator to estimate costs for these services.
You use Azure AI services in Azure AI Foundry portal. Costs for Azure AI services are only a portion of the monthly costs in your Azure bill. You're billed for all Azure services and resources used in your Azure subscription, including the third-party services.
Prerequisites
Cost analysis in Microsoft Cost Management supports most Azure account types, but not all of them. To view the full list of supported account types, seeUnderstand Cost Management data. To view cost data, you need at least read access for an Azure account. For information about assigning access to Microsoft Cost Management data, seeAssign access to data.
Estimate costs before using Azure AI services
Use theAzure pricing calculatorto estimate costs before you add Azure AI services.
Select a product such as Azure OpenAI in the Azure pricing calculator.

Enter the number of units you plan to use. For example, enter the number of tokens for prompts and completions.

You can select more than one product to estimate costs for multiple products. For example, select Virtual Machines to add potential costs for compute resources.

As you add new resources to your project, return to this calculator and add the same resource here to update your cost estimates.
Costs that typically accrue with Azure AI Foundry
When you create resources for a hub, resources for other Azure services are also created. They are:
Costs might accrue before resource deletion
Before you delete a hub in the Azure portal or with Azure CLI, the following sub resources are common costs that accumulate even when you aren't actively working in the workspace. If you're planning on returning to your hub at a later time, these resources might continue to accrue costs:
Azure AI Search (for the data)
Virtual machines
Load Balancer
Azure Virtual Network
Bandwidth
Each VM is billed per hour it's running. Cost depends on VM specifications. VMs that are running but not actively working on a dataset are still charged via the load balancer. For each compute instance, one load balancer is billed per day. Every 50 nodes of a compute cluster have one standard load balancer billed. To avoid load balancer costs on stopped compute instances and compute clusters, delete the compute resource.
Compute instances also incur P10 disk costs even in stopped state. This cost is because any user content saved to disk is persisted across the stopped state similar to Azure VMs. We're working on making the OS disk size/ type configurable to better control costs. For Azure Virtual Networks, one virtual network is billed per subscription and per region. Virtual networks can't span regions or subscriptions. Setting up private endpoints in virtual network setups might also incur charges. If your virtual network uses an Azure Firewall, the firewall might also incur charges. Bandwidth usage is charged; the more data transferred, the more you're charged.
For more information, see theAzure pricing calculator.
Tip
Using a managed virtual network is free. However some features of the managed network rely on Azure Private Link (for private endpoints) and Azure Firewall (for FQDN rules) and will incur charges. For more information, seeManaged virtual network isolation.
Costs might accrue after resource deletion
After you delete a hub in the Azure portal or with Azure CLI, the following resources continue to exist. They continue to accrue costs until you delete them.
Azure Container Registry
Azure Blob Storage
Key Vault
Application Insights (if you enabled it for your hub)
Monitor costs
As you use Azure AI Foundry with hubs, you incur costs. Azure resource usage unit costs vary by time intervals (seconds, minutes, hours, and days) or by unit usage (bytes, megabytes, and so on). You can see the incurred costs incost analysis.
When you use cost analysis, you view hub costs in graphs and tables for different time intervals. Some examples are by day, current and prior month, and year. You also view costs against budgets and forecasted costs. Switching to longer views over time can help you identify spending trends. And you see where overspending might occur. If you create budgets, you can also easily see where they're exceeded.
Monitor Azure AI Foundry project costs
You can get to cost analysis from theAzure portal. You can also get to cost analysis from theAzure AI Foundry portal.
Important
Your Azure AI Foundry project costs are only a subset of your overall application or solution costs. You need to monitor costs for all Azure resources used in your application or solution. For more information, see Azure AI Foundry hubs.
For the examples in this section, assume that all Azure AI Foundry resources are in the same resource group. But you can have resources in different resource groups. For example, your Azure AI Search resource might be in a different resource group than your project.
Here's an example of how to monitor costs for a project. The costs are used as an example only. Your costs vary depending on the services that you use and the amount of usage.

Monitor costs for models offered through the Azure Marketplace
Models deployed as a service using pay-as-you-go are offered through the Azure Marketplace. The model publishers might apply different costs depending on the offering. Each project in Azure AI Foundry portal has its own subscription with the offering, which allows you to monitor the costs and the consumption happening on that project. UseMicrosoft Cost Managementto monitor the costs:
Sign in toAzure portal.

Create budgets
You can createbudgetsto manage costs and createalertsthat automatically notify stakeholders of spending anomalies and overspending risks. Alerts are based on spending compared to budget and cost thresholds. Budgets and alerts are created for Azure subscriptions and resource groups, so they're useful as part of an overall cost monitoring strategy.
Budgets can be created with filters for specific resources or services in Azure if you want more granularity present in your monitoring. Filters help ensure that you don't accidentally create new resources that cost you more money. For more about the filter options when you create a budget, seeGroup and filter options.
Export cost data
You can alsoexport your cost datato a storage account. Exporting data is helpful when you or others need to do more data analysis for costs. For example, finance teams can analyze the data using Excel or Power BI. You can export your costs on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule and set a custom date range. Exporting cost data is the recommended way to retrieve cost datasets.
Understand the full billing model for Azure AI services
Azure AI services run on Azure infrastructure that accrues costs along with Azure AI when you deploy the new resource. It's important to understand that extra infrastructure might accrue cost. You need to manage that cost when you make changes to deployed resources.
When you create or use Azure AI services resources, you might get charged based on the services that you use. There are two billing models available for Azure AI services:
Pay-as-you-go: Pay-as-you-go pricing, you're billed according to the Azure AI services offering that you use, based on its billing information.
Commitment tiers: With commitment tier pricing, you commit to using several service features for a fixed fee, enabling you to have a predictable total cost based on the needs of your workload. You're billed according to the plan you choose. SeeQuickstart: purchase commitment tier pricingfor information on available services, how to sign up, and considerations when purchasing a plan.
Note
If you use the resource above the quota provided by the commitment plan, you will be charged for the additional usage as per the overage amount mentioned in the Azure portal when you purchase a commitment plan.
You can pay for Azure AI services charges with your Azure Prepayment (previously called monetary commitment) credit. However, you can't use Azure Prepayment credit to pay for charges for third-party products and services including ones from the Azure Marketplace.
