Add area paths to organize teams and group work items by product, feature, or business areas. Assigning area paths to teams ensures that work items under those paths appear on the respective team's backlogs and boards. By default, all work items are assigned to the root area path and appear in the project's default team.
After you define area paths at the project level, assign them to teams within the team configuration. You can also create a hierarchical structure of area paths to support subareas, with up to 14 levels deep.
To perform the following tasks, you must define area paths:
Query and chart work items based on Area Path
Assign work to more than one team
Work with management and feature teams
Filter a backlog, query, board, or plan using Area Paths
Tip
You can define your area path structure and assign area paths to teams. Or, you can add a team and create the area path with the team name at that time. If teams are fully independent, create a flat set of area paths. However, if you want to create a hierarchy of teams, then you'll want to create a tree-hierarchy of area paths. For more information, seeConfigure a hierarchy of teams.
To use the following tools, teams must subscribe to area paths:
Boards> all tools
Backlogs> all tools
Sprints> all tools
Delivery plans
Rollup
Analytics> all
To understand how the system uses area paths, seeAbout area and iteration paths.
Prerequisites
For more information, seeSet permissions and access for work tracking.
For naming restrictions on area paths, seeAbout areas and iterations, Naming restrictions.
Get started
Each team has access to various Agile tools, as described inAbout teams and Agile tools. These tools reference the team's default area paths. Most teams use one area path and several iteration paths for work tracking, but teams can also use multiple area paths on their backlogs and boards to support different scenarios.
New projects include a single root area corresponding to the project name and a default team with the same name assigned to this root area path.
If you're new to managing projects and teams, follow these steps to configure your project and teams:
Define area paths: Determine the number and names of area paths needed to categorize your work. Add at least one area path per team. For more information, seeAbout areas and iterations.
Define teams: Decide the number and names of teams required. For more information, seeAbout teams and Agile tools.
Configure area paths: Go toProject settings>Project configuration>Areasand define the area paths for your project. Follow the steps inAdd area paths.
Create teams: Create the necessary teams based on step 2. For more information, seeAdd a team, move from one default team to several teams.
Assign area paths to teams: In the team configuration, assign the default and other area paths to each team. Do the steps inSet team default area paths.
Assign area paths to work items: Assign work items to the defined area paths usingbulk modifyto update multiple items at once.
Note
Assigning the same area path to multiple teams may cause conflicts over work item ownership. For more information, seeLimitations of multi-team board views.
As needed, you can do the following actions at any time:
Add other child nodes
Rename an area path (except the root area path)
Move a child node under another node
Delete a child node
Rename a team
Change the area path assignments made to a team
List project areas
To list project areas, do the following steps:
Browser
Azure DevOps CLI
From your web portal, select (1)Project settings> (2)Project configuration> (3)Areas.

List project area paths|Add a project area path|List team areas paths|Set team area paths|Rename or move a project area path|Remove area path from a team
You can list the area paths defined for a project usingaz boards area project list. To get started, seeGet started with Azure DevOps CLI.

depth: Optional. Depth of child nodes to be listed. Example:--depth 3. When not specified, only the top-level area paths are returned.
--depth 3
path: Optional. Absolute path of an area.\Area\must follow after the\ProjectName, which distinguishes this path from an iteration path. For example,--path \ProjectName\Area\AreaName. If spaces are used within a node, then enclose in double-quotes, for example,--path "\Fabrikam Fiber\Area\Service Delivery\Performance". When not specified, lists area paths from the root level.
\Area\
\ProjectName
--path \ProjectName\Area\AreaName

Set team area paths
All work items that are assigned to a team area path appear on the backlogs and boards for that team. You can select one or more area paths and optionally include their subarea paths. Choose to include subarea paths when you want to support rollup views of work done across several teams or areas.
Note
Teams can be assigned a maximum of 300Area Paths. For more information, seeWork tracking, process, and project limits.
The default area path determines the default area path assigned to work items that are created from the team context.
Important
Work items that appear on more than one team's board can yield query results that don't meet your expectations. Because each team can customize the boardcolumnsandswimlanes, the values assigned to work items which appear on different boards may not be the same. The primary work around for this issue is to maintain single ownership of work items by team area path.
