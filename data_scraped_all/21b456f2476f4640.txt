There are a few things you need to start using Azure Virtual Desktop. Here you can find what prerequisites you need to complete to successfully provide your users with desktops and applications.
At a high level, you need:
An Azure account with an active subscription
A supported identity provider
A supported operating system for session host virtual machines
Appropriate licenses
Network connectivity
A Remote Desktop client
Azure account with an active subscription
You need an Azure account with an active subscription to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop. If you don't have one already, you cancreate an account for free.
To deploy Azure Virtual Desktop, you need to assign the relevant Azure role-based access control (RBAC) roles. The specific role requirements are covered in each of the related articles for deploying Azure Virtual Desktop, which are listed in theNext stepssection.
Also make sure you've registered theMicrosoft.DesktopVirtualizationresource provider for your subscription. To check the status of the resource provider and register if needed, select the relevant tab for your scenario and follow the steps.
Important
You must have permission to register a resource provider, which requires the*/register/actionoperation. This is included if your account is assigned thecontributor or owner roleon your subscription.

Identity
To access desktops and applications from your session hosts, your users need to be able to authenticate.Microsoft Entra IDis Microsoft's centralized cloud identity service that enables this capability. Microsoft Entra ID is always used to authenticate users for Azure Virtual Desktop. Session hosts can be joined to the same Microsoft Entra tenant, or to an Active Directory domain usingActive Directory Domain Services(AD DS) orMicrosoft Entra Domain Services, providing you with a choice of flexible configuration options.
Session hosts
You need to join session hosts that provide desktops and applications to the same Microsoft Entra tenant as your users, or an Active Directory domain (either AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services).
Note
For Azure Local, you can only join session hosts to an Active Directory Domain Services domain. You can only join session hosts on Azure Local to an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. This includes usingMicrosoft Entra hybrid join, where you can benefit from some of the functionality provided by Microsoft Entra ID.
To join session hosts to Microsoft Entra ID or an Active Directory domain, you need the following permissions:
For Microsoft Entra ID, you need an account that can join computers to your tenant. For more information, seeManage device identities. To learn more about joining session hosts to Microsoft Entra ID, seeMicrosoft Entra joined session hosts.
For Microsoft Entra ID, you need an account that can join computers to your tenant. For more information, seeManage device identities. To learn more about joining session hosts to Microsoft Entra ID, seeMicrosoft Entra joined session hosts.
For an Active Directory domain, you need a domain account that can join computers to your domain. For Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you would need to be a member of theAAD DC Administratorsgroup.
For an Active Directory domain, you need a domain account that can join computers to your domain. For Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you would need to be a member of theAAD DC Administratorsgroup.
Users
Your users need accounts that are in Microsoft Entra ID. If you're also using AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services in your deployment of Azure Virtual Desktop, these accounts need to behybrid identities, which means the user accounts are synchronized. You need to keep the following things in mind based on which identity provider you use:
If you're using Microsoft Entra ID with AD DS, you need to configureMicrosoft Entra Connectto synchronize user identity data between AD DS and Microsoft Entra ID.
If you're using Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Entra Domain Services, user accounts are synchronized one way from Microsoft Entra ID to Microsoft Entra Domain Services. This synchronization process is automatic.
Important
The user account must exist in the Microsoft Entra tenant you use for Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't supportB2B,B2C, or personal Microsoft accounts.
When using hybrid identities, either the UserPrincipalName (UPN) or the Security Identifier (SID) must match across Active Directory Domain Services and Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeSupported identities and authentication methods.
Supported identity scenarios
The following table summarizes identity scenarios that Azure Virtual Desktop currently supports:
For more detailed information about supported identity scenarios, including single sign-on and multifactor authentication, seeSupported identities and authentication methods.
FSLogix Profile Container
To useFSLogix Profile Containerwhen joining your session hosts to Microsoft Entra ID, you need tostore profiles on Azure FilesorAzure NetApp Filesand your user accounts must behybrid identities. You must create these accounts in AD DS and synchronize them to Microsoft Entra ID. To learn more about deploying FSLogix Profile Container with different identity scenarios, see the following articles:
Set up FSLogix Profile Container with Azure Files and Active Directory Domain Services or Microsoft Entra Domain Services.
Set up FSLogix Profile Container with Azure Files and Microsoft Entra ID.
Set up FSLogix Profile Container with Azure NetApp Files
Deployment parameters
You need to enter the following identity parameters when deploying session hosts:
Domain name, if using AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services.
Credentials to join session hosts to the domain.
Organizational Unit (OU), which is an optional parameter that lets you place session hosts in the desired OU at deployment time.
Important
The account you use for joining a domain can't have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.
Operating systems and licenses
You have a choice of operating systems (OS) that you can use for session hosts to provide desktops and applications. You can use different operating systems with different host pools to provide flexibility to your users. We support the 64-bit operating systems and SKUs in the following table lists (where supported versions and dates are inline with theMicrosoft Lifecycle Policy), along with the licensing methods applicable for each commercial purpose:

For Azure, you can use operating system images provided by Microsoft in theAzure Marketplace, or create your own custom images stored in an Azure Compute Gallery or as a managed image. Using custom image templates for Azure Virtual Desktop enables you to easily create a custom image that you can use when deploying session host virtual machines (VMs). To learn more about how to create custom images, see:
Custom image templates in Azure Virtual Desktop
Store and share images in an Azure Compute Gallery.
Create a managed image of a generalized VM in Azure.
Alternatively, for Azure Local you can use operating system images from:
Azure Marketplace. For more information, seeCreate Azure Local VM image using Azure Marketplace images.
Azure Storage account. For more information, seeCreate Azure Local VM image using image in Azure Storage account.
A local share. For more information, seeCreate Azure Local VM image using images in a local share.
You can deploy a virtual machines (VMs) to be used as session hosts from these images with any of the following methods:
Automatically, as part of thehost pool setup processin the Azure portal.
Manually byadding session hosts to an existing host poolin the Azure portal.
Programmatically, withAzure CLIorAzure PowerShell.
If your license entitles you to use Azure Virtual Desktop, you don't need to install or apply a separate license, however if you're using per-user access pricing for external users, you need toenroll an Azure Subscription. You need to make sure the Windows license used on your session hosts is correctly assigned in Azure and the operating system is activated. For more information, seeApply Windows license to session host virtual machines.
For session hosts on Azure Local, you must license and activate the virtual machines you use before you use them with Azure Virtual Desktop. For activating Windows 10 and Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, and Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, useAzure verification for VMs. For all other OS images (such as Windows 10 and Windows 11 Enterprise, and other editions of Windows Server), you should continue to use existing activation methods. For more information, seeActivate Windows Server VMs on Azure Local.
Note
To ensure continued functionality with the latest security update, update your VMs on Azure Local to the latest cumulative update by June 17, 2024. This update is essential for VMs to continue using Azure benefits. For more information, seeAzure verification for VMs.
Tip
To simplify user access rights during initial development and testing, Azure Virtual Desktop supportsAzure Dev/Test pricing. If you deploy Azure Virtual Desktop in an Azure Dev/Test subscription, end users may connect to that deployment without separate license entitlement in order to perform acceptance tests or provide feedback.
Network
There are several network requirements you need to meet to successfully deploy Azure Virtual Desktop. This lets users connect to their desktops and applications while also giving them the best possible user experience.
Users connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop securely establish a reverse connection to the service, which means you don't need to open any inbound ports. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on port 443 is used by default, however RDP Shortpath can be used formanaged networksandpublic networksthat establishes a direct User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based transport.
To successfully deploy Azure Virtual Desktop, you need to meet the following network requirements:
You need a virtual network and subnet for your session hosts. If you create your session hosts at the same time as a host pool, you must create this virtual network in advance for it to appear in the drop-down list. Your virtual network must be in the same Azure region as the session host.

Your session hosts and users need to be able to connect to the Azure Virtual Desktop service. These connections also use TCP on port 443 to a specific list of URLs. For more information, seeRequired URL list. You must make sure these URLs aren't blocked by network filtering or a firewall in order for your deployment to work properly and be supported. If your users need to access Microsoft 365, make sure your session hosts can connect toMicrosoft 365 endpoints.

Round-trip time (RTT) latency from the client's network to the Azure region that contains the host pools should be less than 150 ms. To see which locations have the best latency, look up your desired location inAzure network round-trip latency statistics. To optimize for network performance, we recommend you create session hosts in the Azure region closest to your users.

To help secure your Azure Virtual Desktop environment in Azure, we recommend you don't open inbound port 3389 on your session hosts. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't require an open inbound port to be open. If you must open port 3389 for troubleshooting purposes, we recommend you usejust-in-time VM access. We also recommend you don't assign a public IP address to your session hosts.

Note
To keep Azure Virtual Desktop reliable and scalable, we aggregate traffic patterns and usage to check the health and performance of the infrastructure control plane. We aggregate this information from all locations where the service infrastructure is, then send it to the US region. The data sent to the US region includes scrubbed data, but not customer data. For more information, seeData locations for Azure Virtual Desktop.
Session host management
Consider the following points when managing session hosts:
Don't enable any policies or configurations that disableWindows Installer. If you disable Windows Installer, the service can't install agent updates on your session hosts, and your session hosts won't function properly.
