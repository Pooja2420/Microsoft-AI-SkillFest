Azure Policyhelps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.
Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. Policy definitions for these common use cases are already available in your Azure environment as built-ins to help you get started.
The process ofcreating and implementing a policy in Azure Policybegins with creating a (built-in or custom)policy definition. Every policy definition has conditions under which it's enforced. It also has a definedeffectthat takes place if the conditions are met. Azure NetApp Files is supported with both Azure Policy custom and built-in policy definitions.
Custom policy definitions
Azure NetApp Files supports Azure Policy. You can integrate Azure NetApp Files with Azure Policy throughcreating custom policy definitions. You can find examples inEnforce Snapshot Policies with Azure PolicyandAzure Policy now available for Azure NetApp Files.
