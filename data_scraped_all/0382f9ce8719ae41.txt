Markdown content capabilities and limitations
You can use any combination of plain text, Markdown syntax, and HTML content on the markdown tile. The Azure portal uses an open-source library calledmarkedto transform your content into HTML that is shown on the tile. The HTML produced bymarkedis pre-processed by the portal before it's rendered. This step helps make sure that your customization won't affect the security or layout of the portal. During that pre-processing, any part of the HTML that poses a potential threat is removed. The following types of content aren't allowed by the portal:
JavaScript â<script>tags and inline JavaScript evaluations are removed.
<script>
iframes -<iframe>tags are removed.
<iframe>
Style -<style>tags are removed. Inline style attributes on HTML elements aren't officially supported. You may find that some inline style elements work for you, but if they interfere with the layout of the portal, they could stop working at any time. The Markdown tile is intended for basic, static content that uses the default styles of the portal.
