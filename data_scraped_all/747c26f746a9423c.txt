Service guides are intended to help you in decision-making for individual Azure components within a workload. Each guide highlights the core features and capabilities essential for achieving a state of excellence. They aren't configuration guides or exhaustive lists of all features and capabilities, but rather emphasize the usefulness of features from the perspective of the Well-Architected pillars.
