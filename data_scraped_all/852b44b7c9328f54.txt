General
Microsoft Entra profile information (preview)
Last fall, we introducedMicrosoft Entra profile informationintegration in Azure DevOps, so you no longer need to update your profile separately. Over the next few weeks, this will become the default experience.

The preview will run for a month or two, and after that this will be the way profile information works for Entra users in Azure DevOps. If you need to opt out during the preview, please share feedback so we can address any issues during the preview.

Basic access included with GitHub Enterprise
Starting this week, we're including Azure DevOps Basic usage rights with GitHub Enterprise licenses and automating the experience for Azure DevOps users.
If you're using GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Microsoft Entra, you'll be automatically recognized in Azure DevOps. Your access level will be set to 'GitHub Enterprise,' and you won't accrue additional charges in Azure DevOpsLearn more about access for GitHub Enterprise users.
Initially this capability is limited to GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, but weâll be adding GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency users soon.

GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps
One click enablement for dependency scanning preview
From your repository settings, you can now enable the Advanced Security dependency scanning task without needing to edit your pipeline definition.
By opting in to "Scan default branch for vulnerable dependencies," the dependency task will automatically run in any pipeline targeting your default branch or pull requests targeting your default branch if the task is not already present in your pipeline. If the task is already present in your pipeline, the task will not run again.
To participate in the preview, send us anemail!

Deleted branches removed from Advanced Security branch picker
Within GitHub Advanced Security, the repository-level branch picker showed all branches for your repository once they had any security alerts discovered on those branches, even if the branch was later deleted.
Now, any branches that are deleted will be appropriately removed from the Advanced Security branch picker and any associated alerts will no longer be retrievable.
Azure Boards
GitHub Integration: Linking the Merge Commit
We now automatically link the merge commit to its corresponding work item when a pull request is completed.
Increase limit of connected GitHub repositories
Over the past several months, we've enhanced both the user experience and scalability of connecting your GitHub repositories to an Azure DevOps project. In this sprint, we're raising the maximum limit from 500 to 1,000 repositories, giving you even greater capacity to manage your projects.
Update on New Boards Hub rollout
By early March, New Boards Hub will become the default experience for all organizations using the Azure DevOps service. This means every user will have at least tried New Boards, and our telemetry shows that about 98% of users are continuing to stay with it. Since we aim to maintain a single version of the product, our next step is to disable the option to revert back to Old Boards.
For some organizations, this change has already been implemented. For others, we plan to begin rolling it out in March and complete the process for all organizations by the end of May. As always, if you encounter any issues,please report them via the Developer Community.
Azure Pipelines
Pipelines using Ubuntu 24.04 will show warnings for certain tasks
TheUbuntu 24.04Pipelines image has been in preview since October last year. We plan to update theubuntu-latestimage to map toubuntu-24.04in March.
ubuntu-latest
ubuntu-24.04
Some tools are no longer available on the Ubuntu 24.04 image:
MSBuild@1
NuGetCommand@2
ubuntu-24.04
TerraformInstaller@1
For more information on software differences with the Ubuntu 22.02 image, seeUbuntu-24.04 image.
In preparation of the mapping ofubuntu-latestandubuntu-24.04, pipelines using these image labels will show warnings over the coming weeks.
ubuntu-latest
ubuntu-24.04

Informational runs
Informational runs tell you Azure Pipelines failed to determine if a pipeline should run or not, because it couldn't process the pipeline's YAML file. Examples of such failures are failures to retrieve the YAML source code or errors in it.
With this sprint, we're adding support for informational runs for pipelines hosted in Azure Repos. You can see an example below.

The pipeline run error tells you the YAML file is incorrect, and this prevents Azure Pipelines from evaluating its trigger conditions.
Test Plans
Undo test step in web and desktop runner
Take control of your test case run with the new "Undo" option. You can easily revert test step statuses with a simple double-click, giving you more flexibility and control during test runs. No more restarting test cases to fix accidental clicksâjust undo and continue your workflow without interruption.
We're also introducing keyboard-friendly navigation and accessibility improvements to ensure this feature works seamlessly for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies. This enhancement helps you save time, reduce frustration, and stay focused on running tests efficiently. Give it a try and let us know viaemailwhat you think!

Next steps

These features will roll out over the next two to three weeks.
