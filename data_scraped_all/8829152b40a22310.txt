Security is a critical concern for all online systems. This article provides design considerations and recommendations to protect and secure your Azure Red Hat OpenShift deployments.
Design considerations
Azure Red Hat OpenShift works with other Azure services like Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Container Registry, Azure Storage, and Azure Virtual Network. These interfaces require special attention during the planning phase. Azure Red Hat OpenShift also adds extra complexity, so you should consider applying the same security governance and compliance mechanisms and controls as in the rest of your infrastructure landscape.
Here are some design considerations for security governance and compliance:
If you deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster using Azure landing zone best practices, get familiar with thepolicies that will be inherited by the clusters.

Decide whether the cluster's control plane should be accessible via the internet, which is the default. If so, IP restrictions are recommended. If the cluster control plane will be accessible only from within your private network, either in Azure or on-premises, then deployAzure Red Hat OpenShift private cluster.

Decide how secrets will be managed in your cluster. You can either useAzure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driverto protect secrets, orconnect Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster to Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetesand use theAzure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets.

Decide whether your container registry is accessible via the internet, or only within a specific virtual network. Disabling internet access in a container registry can have negative effects on other systems that rely on public connectivity, such as continuous integration pipelines or Microsoft Defender for Containers image scanning. For more information, seeConnect privately to a container registry using Azure Private Link.

Design recommendations
Limit access to theAzure Red Hat OpenShift cluster configurationfile by integrating with Microsoft Entra ID or your ownidentity provider. Assign appropriateOpenShift role-based access controlsuch as cluster-admin or cluster-reader.

Secure pod access to resources. Provide the least number of permissions, and avoid using root or privileged escalation.

Keep your clusters on the latest OpenShift version to avoid potential security or upgrade issues. Azure Red Hat OpenShift only supports thecurrent and previous generally available minor releaseof Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.Upgrade the clusterif it's on a version that's older than the last minor release.
