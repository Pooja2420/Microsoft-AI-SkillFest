Tip
There are manymethods to deploy an availability group. Simplify your deployment and eliminate the need for an Azure Load Balancer or distributed network name (DNN) for your Always On availability group by creating your SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) inmultiple subnetswithin the same Azure virtual network. If you've already created your availability group in a single subnet, you canmigrate it to a multi-subnet environment.
This article explains how to create a failover cluster instance (FCI) by usingStorage Spaces Directwith SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). Storage Spaces Direct acts as a software-based virtual storage area network (VSAN) that synchronizes the storage (data disks) between the nodes (Azure VMs) in a Windows cluster.
To learn more, see an overview ofFCI with SQL Server on Azure VMsandcluster best practices.
Note
It's now possible to lift and shift your failover cluster instance solution to SQL Server on Azure VMs using Azure Migrate. SeeMigrate failover cluster instanceto learn more.
Overview
Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)supports two types of architectures: converged and hyperconverged. A hyperconverged infrastructure places the storage on the same servers that host the clustered application, so that storage is on each SQL Server FCI node.
The following diagram shows the complete solution, which uses hyperconverged Storage Spaces Direct with SQL Server on Azure VMs:

The preceding diagram shows the following resources in the same resource group:
Two virtual machines in a Windows Server failover cluster. When a virtual machine is in a failover cluster, it's also called acluster nodeornode.
Each virtual machine has two or more data disks.
Storage Spaces Direct synchronizes the data on the data disks and presents the synchronized storage as a storage pool.
The storage pool presents a Cluster Shared Volume (CSV) to the failover cluster.
The SQL Server FCI cluster role uses the CSV for the data drives.
An Azure load balancer to hold the IP address for the SQL Server FCI for a single subnet scenario.
An Azure availability set holds all the resources.
Note
You can create this entire solution in Azure from a template. An example of a template is available on the GitHubAzure quickstart templatespage. This example isn't designed or tested for any specific workload. You can run the template to create a SQL Server FCI with Storage Spaces Direct storage connected to your domain. You can evaluate the template and modify it for your purposes.
Prerequisites
Before you complete the instructions in this article, you should already have:
An Azure subscription. Get started with afree Azure account.
Two or more prepared Azure Windows virtual machinesin anavailability set.
An account that has permissions to create objects on both Azure virtual machines and in Active Directory.
The latest version ofPowerShell.
Create Windows Failover Cluster
The steps to create your Windows Server Failover Cluster differ between single subnet and multi-subnet environments. To create your cluster, follow the steps in the tutorial for either amulti-subnet scenarioor asingle subnet scenario. Though these tutorials create an availability group, the steps to create the cluster are the same for a failover cluster instance.
Configure quorum
Although the disk witness is the most resilient quorum option, it's not supported for failover cluster instances configured with Storage Spaces Direct. As such, the cloud witness is the recommended quorum solution for this type of cluster configuration for SQL Server on Azure VMs.
If you have an even number of votes in the cluster, configure thequorum solutionthat best suits your business needs. For more information, seeQuorum with SQL Server VMs.
Validate the cluster
Validate the cluster in the Failover Cluster Manager UI or by using PowerShell.
To validate the cluster by using the UI, do the following on one of the virtual machines:
InServer Manager, selectTools, and then selectFailover Cluster Manager.

To validate the cluster by using PowerShell, run the following script from an administrator PowerShell session on one of the virtual machines:
Test-Cluster âNode ("<node1>","<node2>") âInclude "Storage Spaces Direct", "Inventory", "Network", "System Configuration"
Test-Cluster âNode ("<node1>","<node2>") âInclude "Storage Spaces Direct", "Inventory", "Network", "System Configuration"
Add storage
The disks for Storage Spaces Direct need to be empty. They can't contain partitions or other data. To clean the disks, follow the instructions inDeploy Storage Spaces Direct.
Enable Storage Spaces Direct.The following PowerShell script enables Storage Spaces Direct:Enable-ClusterS2DInFailover Cluster Manager, you can now see the storage pool.
Enable Storage Spaces Direct.
The following PowerShell script enables Storage Spaces Direct:

InFailover Cluster Manager, you can now see the storage pool.
Create a volume.Storage Spaces Direct automatically creates a storage pool when you enable it. You're now ready to create a volume. The PowerShell cmdletNew-Volumeautomates the volume creation process. This process includes formatting, adding the volume to the cluster, and creating a CSV. This example creates an 800 gigabyte (GB) CSV:New-Volume -StoragePoolFriendlyName S2D* -FriendlyName VDisk01 -FileSystem CSVFS_REFS -Size 800GBAfter you've run the preceding command, an 800-GB volume is mounted as a cluster resource. The volume is atC:\ClusterStorage\Volume1\.This screenshot shows a CSV with Storage Spaces Direct:

Test cluster failover
Test the failover of your cluster. InFailover Cluster Manager, right-click your cluster, selectMore Actions>Move Core Cluster Resource>Select node, and then select the other node of the cluster. Move the core cluster resource to every node of the cluster, and then move it back to the primary node. If you can successfully move the cluster to each node, you're ready to install SQL Server.

Create SQL Server FCI
After you've configured the failover cluster and all cluster components, including storage, you can create the SQL Server FCI.
Create first node in the SQL FCI
To create the first node in the SQL Server FCI, follow these steps:
Connect to the first virtual machine by usingBastion.
Connect to the first virtual machine by usingBastion.
InFailover Cluster Manager, make sure all core cluster resources are on the first virtual machine. If necessary, move all resources to that virtual machine.

Register with SQL IaaS Agent extension
To manage your SQL Server VM from the portal, register it with theSQL IaaS Agent extension. Note that onlylimited functionalitywill be available to SQL Server VMs that have failover clustered instances of SQL Server (FCIs).
Note
At this time, SQL Server failover cluster instances on Azure virtual machines registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension only support alimitednumber of features available through basic registration, and not those that require the agent, such as automated backup, patching, Microsoft Entra authentication and advanced portal management. See thetable of benefitsto learn more.
Register a SQL Server VM with PowerShell (-LicenseType can bePAYGorAHUB):
PAYG
AHUB
# Get the existing compute VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>
         
# Register SQL VM with SQL IaaS Agent extension
New-AzSqlVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
   -LicenseType <license_type>
# Get the existing compute VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>
         
# Register SQL VM with SQL IaaS Agent extension
New-AzSqlVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
   -LicenseType <license_type>
Configure connectivity
If you deployed your SQL Server VMs in multiple subnets, skip this step. If you deployed your SQL Server VMs to a single subnet, then you'll need to configure an additional component to route traffic to your FCI. You can configure a virtual network name (VNN) with an Azure Load Balancer, or a distributed network name for a failover cluster instance.Review the differences between the twoand then deploy either adistributed network nameor avirtual network name and Azure Load Balancerfor your failover cluster instance.
Limitations
Disks that have been attached as NTFS-formatted disks can be used with Storage Spaces Direct only if the disk eligibility option is unchecked, or cleared, when storage is being added to the cluster.
