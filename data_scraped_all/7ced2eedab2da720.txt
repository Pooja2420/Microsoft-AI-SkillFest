In this article
Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is a fully managed service for pure open-source Apache Cassandra clusters. The service also allows configurations to be overridden, depending on the specific needs of each workload, allowing maximum flexibility and control where needed
This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure portal to create an Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.

Scale a datacenter
Now that you have deployed a cluster with a single data center, you can either scale horizontally or vertically by highlighting the data center, and selecting theScalebutton:
Scale

Horizontal scale
To scale out or scale in on nodes, move the slider to the desired number, or just edit the value. When finished, hitScale.
Scale

Vertical scale
To scale up or to scale down SKU size for your nodes, select from theSku Sizedropdown. When finished, hitScale.

Scale

Note
The length of time it takes for a scaling operation depends on various factors, it may take several minutes. When Azure notifies you that the scale operation has completed, this does not mean that all your nodes have joined the Cassandra ring. Nodes will be fully commissioned when they all display a status of "healthy", and the datacenter status reads "succeeded".
Scaling is an online operation and works in the same manner as described for patching inManagement operations

Update Cassandra version
Important
Cassandra 5.0 and Turnkey Version Updates, are in public preview.
These features are provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
For more information, seeSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.
You have the option to conduct in-place major version upgrades directly from the portal or through Az CLI, Terraform, or ARM templates.

Turnkey replication
Cassandra 5.0 introduces a streamlined approach for deploying multi-region clusters, offering enhanced convenience and efficiency. Using turnkey replication functionality, setting up and managing multi-region clusters has become more accessible, allowing for smoother integration and operation across distributed environments. This update significantly reduces the complexities traditionally associated with deploying and maintaining multi-region configurations, allowing users to use Cassandra's capabilities with greater ease and effectiveness.

Tip
None: Auto replicate is set to none.
SystemKeyspaces: Auto-replicate all system keyspaces (system_auth, system_traces, system_auth)
AllKeyspaces: Auto-replicate all keyspaces and monitor if new keyspaces are created and then apply auto-replicate settings automatically.
When adding a new data center, the auto-replicate feature in Cassandra will seamlessly executenodetool rebuildto ensure the successful replication of data across the added data center.
nodetool rebuild
Removing a data center triggers an automatic removal of the specific data center from the keyspaces.
For external data centers, such as those hosted on-premises, they can be included in the keyspaces through the utilization of the external data center property. This enables Cassandra to incorporate these external data centers as sources for the rebuilding process.
Warning
Setting auto-replicate to AllKeyspaces will change your keyspaces replication to includeWITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-prem-datacenter-1' : 3, 'mi-datacenter-1': 3 }If this is not the topology you want, you will need to use SystemKeyspaces, adjust them yourself, and runnodetool rebuildmanually on the Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster.
WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-prem-datacenter-1' : 3, 'mi-datacenter-1': 3 }
nodetool rebuild
De-allocate cluster
For non-production environments, you can pause/de-allocate resources in the cluster in order to avoid being charged for them (you will continue to be charged for storage). First change cluster type toNonProduction, thendeallocate.
NonProduction
deallocate
Tip
Cluster type should be used as "NonProduction" only to save development costs. They may come with smaller SKU's, and should NOT be used to run production workloads.
Warning
Cluster type defined as "Nonproduction" will not have SLA guarantees applied to it.
Do not execute any schema or write operations during de-allocation - this can lead to data loss and in rare cases schema corruption requiring manual intervention from the support team.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter an error when applying permissions to your Virtual Network using Azure CLI, such asCannot find user or service principal in graph database for 'e5007d2c-4b13-4a74-9b6a-605d99f03501', you can apply the same permission manually from the Azure portal. Learn how to do thishere.
Note
The Azure Cosmos DB role assignment is used for deployment purposes only. Azure Managed Instanced for Apache Cassandra has no backend dependencies on Azure Cosmos DB.
Connecting to your cluster
Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra does not create nodes with public IP addresses, so to connect to your newly created Cassandra cluster, you will need to create another resource inside the VNet. This could be an application, or a Virtual Machine with Apache's open-source query toolCQLSHinstalled. You can use atemplateto deploy an Ubuntu Virtual Machine.
Connecting from CQLSH
After the virtual machine is deployed, use SSH to connect to the machine, and install CQLSH using the below commands:
# Install default-jre and default-jdk
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre

# Install the Cassandra libraries in order to get CQLSH:
echo "deb http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 311x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
curl https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cassandra

# Export the SSL variables:
export SSL_VERSION=TLSv1_2
export SSL_VALIDATE=false

# Connect to CQLSH (replace <IP> with the private IP addresses of a node in your Datacenter):
host=("<IP>")
initial_admin_password="Password provided when creating the cluster"
cqlsh $host 9042 -u cassandra -p $initial_admin_password --ssl
# Install default-jre and default-jdk
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre

# Install the Cassandra libraries in order to get CQLSH:
echo "deb http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 311x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
curl https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cassandra

# Export the SSL variables:
export SSL_VERSION=TLSv1_2
export SSL_VALIDATE=false

# Connect to CQLSH (replace <IP> with the private IP addresses of a node in your Datacenter):
host=("<IP>")
initial_admin_password="Password provided when creating the cluster"
cqlsh $host 9042 -u cassandra -p $initial_admin_password --ssl
Connecting from an application
As with CQLSH, connecting from an application using one of the supportedApache Cassandra client driversrequires SSL encryption to be enabled, and certification verification to be disabled. See samples for connecting to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra usingJava,.NET,Node.jsandPython.
Disabling certificate verification is recommended because certificate verification will not work unless you map I.P addresses of your cluster nodes to the appropriate domain. If you have an internal policy which mandates that you do SSL certificate verification for any application, you can facilitate this by adding entries like10.0.1.5 host1.managedcassandra.cosmos.azure.comin your hosts file for each node. If taking this approach, you would also need to add new entries whenever scaling up nodes.
10.0.1.5 host1.managedcassandra.cosmos.azure.com
For Java, we also highly recommend enablingspeculative execution policywhere applications are sensitive to tail latency. You can find a demo illustrating how this works and how to enable the policyhere.
Note
In the vast majority of cases it shouldnot be necessaryto configure or install certificates (rootCA, node or client, truststores, etc) to connect to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra. SSL encryption can be enabled by using the default truststore and password of the runtime being used by the client (seeJava,.NET,Node.jsandPythonsamples), because Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra certificates will be trusted by that environment. In rare cases, if the certificate is not trusted, you may need to add it to the truststore.
Configuring client certificates (optional)
Configuring client certificates isoptional. A client application can connect to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra as long as the above steps have been taken. However, if preferred, you can also additionally create and configure client certificates for authentication. In general, there are two ways of creating certificates:
Self signed certs. This means a private and public (no CA) certificate for each node - in this case we need all public certificates.
Certs signed by a CA. This can be a self-signed CA or even a public one. In this case we need the root CA certificate (refer toinstructions on preparing SSL certificatesfor production), and all intermediaries (if applicable).
If you want to implement client-to-node certificate authentication or mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS), you need to provide the certificates via Azure CLI. The below command will upload and apply your client certificates to the truststore for your Cassandra Managed Instance cluster (i.e. you do not need to editcassandra.yamlsettings). Once applied, your  cluster will require Cassandra to verify the certificates when a client connects (seerequire_client_auth: truein Cassandraclient_encryption_options).
cassandra.yaml
require_client_auth: true
resourceGroupName='<Resource_Group_Name>'
clusterName='<Cluster Name>'

az managed-cassandra cluster update \
  --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
  --cluster-name $clusterName \
  --client-certificates /usr/csuser/clouddrive/rootCert.pem /usr/csuser/clouddrive/intermediateCert.pem
resourceGroupName='<Resource_Group_Name>'
clusterName='<Cluster Name>'

  --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
  --cluster-name $clusterName \
  --client-certificates /usr/csuser/clouddrive/rootCert.pem /usr/csuser/clouddrive/intermediateCert.pem
Clean up resources
If you're not going to continue to use this managed instance cluster, delete it with the following steps:
From the left-hand menu of Azure portal, selectResource groups.
From the list, select the resource group you created for this quickstart.
On the resource groupOverviewpane, selectDelete resource group.
In the next window, enter the name of the resource group to delete, and then selectDelete.
