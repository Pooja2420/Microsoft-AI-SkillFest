The simplest way to set up Azure DevOps Server is to put everything on a single server. To confirm that this configuration is appropriate for your team, see thehardware recommendations. If not, consider adual-serverormultiple-serverconfiguration instead.
If you're upgrading from an earlier version, learn more aboutcompatibility,release notes, andgetting started with your upgrade.
Note
The procedures to install a new deployment are similar for all versions of Azure DevOps Server. Images shown in this article may reference Azure DevOps Server 2022 or Azure DevOps Server 2019, however, the information configured is the same unless otherwise noted.
Prerequisites
Prepare a single computer that satisfies thesystem requirements.

If you don't plan to use SQL Server Express, set up asupported version of SQL Server. When you set up SQL Server for Azure DevOps on-premises, at a minimum install the Database Engine and Full-Text and Semantic Extractions for Search features.We recommend that you use SQL Server Express only for personal or evaluation deployments. Paid copies of Azure DevOps on-premises include a SQL Server Standard license. For more information, seeAzure DevOps Server pricingandTeam Foundation Server pricing. If you use the included license, you can use it only for databases created with those products.

The account you use to configure the installation must be a member of thesysadmin server role in SQL Server.NoteInstalling Azure DevOps on-premises involves a complex set of operations that require a high degree of privilege. These operations include creating databases, provisioning logins for service accounts, and more. Technically, all that's required is:Membership in the serveradmin role.ALTER ANY LOGIN, CREATE ANY DATABASE, and VIEW ANY DEFINITION server-scoped permissions.CONTROL permission on the main database.Membership in the sysadmin server role confers all these memberships and permissions. It's the easiest way to ensure that configuration succeeds. If necessary, you can revoke these memberships and permissions after installation.

To support installation and configuration of theSearchextension, you need to provide a user name and password. Installing and configuringSearchsupports Code, Work Item and Wiki search features. For more information, seeConfigure search.  Note that user names can't include a hyphen or special characters.NoteSearch also requires Oracle Server JRE 8 (Update 60 or higher). You can download and install or update to the latest version by accepting the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Server JRE and selectingConfigure. Note that this will set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the Java installation directory, and that Server JRE does not provide automatic updates.
