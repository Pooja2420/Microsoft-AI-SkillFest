Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. If Microsoft Entra ID locks a user's account or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application. We recommend this video onHow to enable and configure SSPR in Microsoft Entra ID. We also have a video for IT administrators onresolving the six most common end-user error messages with SSPR.
Important
This tutorial shows an administrator how to enable self-service password reset. If you're an end user already registered for self-service password reset and need to get back into your account, go to theMicrosoft Online password resetpage.
If your IT team hasn't enabled the ability to reset your own password, reach out to your helpdesk for additional assistance.
In this tutorial you learn how to:
Enable self-service password reset for a group of Microsoft Entra users
Set up authentication methods and registration options
Test the SSPR process as a user
Important
In March 2023, we announced the deprecation of managing authentication methods in the legacy multifactor authentication and self-service password reset (SSPR) policies. Beginning September 30, 2025, authentication methods can't be managed in these legacy MFA and SSPR policies. We recommend customers use the manual migration control to migrate to the Authentication methods policy by the deprecation date.

Prerequisites
To finish this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:
A working Microsoft Entra tenant with at least a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required for password reset. For more information about license requirements for password change and password reset in Microsoft Entra ID, seeLicensing requirements for Microsoft Entra self-service password reset.
An account with at least the Authentication Policy Administrator role.
A non-administrator user with a password you know, liketestuser. You'll test the end-user SSPR experience using this account in this tutorial.If you need to create a user, seeQuickstart: Add new users to Microsoft Entra ID.
If you need to create a user, seeQuickstart: Add new users to Microsoft Entra ID.
A group that the non-administrator user is a member of, likesSSPR-Test-Group. You'll enable SSPR for this group in this tutorial.If you need to create a group, seeCreate a basic group and add members using Microsoft Entra ID.

Enable self-service password reset
Microsoft Entra ID lets you enable SSPR forNone,Selected, orAllusers. This granular ability lets you choose a subset of users to test the SSPR registration process and workflow. When you're comfortable with the process and the time is right to communicate the requirements with a broader set of users, you can select a group of users to enable for SSPR. Or, you can enable SSPR for everyone in the Microsoft Entra tenant.
Note
Currently, you can only enable one Microsoft Entra group for SSPR using the Microsoft Entra admin center. As part of a wider deployment of SSPR, Microsoft Entra ID supports nested groups.
In this tutorial, set up SSPR for a set of users in a test group. Use theSSPR-Test-Groupand provide your own Microsoft Entra group as needed:
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least anAuthentication Policy Administrator.

Select authentication methods and registration options
When users need to unlock their account or reset their password, they're prompted for another confirmation method. This extra authentication factor makes sure that Microsoft Entra ID finished only approved SSPR events. You can choose which authentication methods to allow, based on the registration information the user provides.
From the menu on the left side of theAuthentication methodspage, set theNumber of methods required to resetto2.To improve security, you can increase the number of authentication methods required for SSPR.

Before users can unlock their account or reset a password, they must register their contact information. Microsoft Entra ID uses this contact information for the different authentication methods set up in the previous steps.
An administrator can manually provide this contact information, or users can go to a registration portal to provide the information themselves. In this tutorial, set up Microsoft Entra ID to prompt the users for registration the next time they sign in.
From the menu on the left side of theRegistrationpage, selectYesforRequire users to register when signing in.
From the menu on the left side of theRegistrationpage, selectYesforRequire users to register when signing in.

To apply the registration settings, selectSave.
Note
The interruption to request to register contact information during signing in only occurs if the conditions configured on the settings are met. This only applies to users and admin accounts that are enabled to reset passwords using Microsoft Entra self-service password reset.
Set up notifications and customizations
To keep users informed about account activity, you can set up Microsoft Entra ID to send email notifications when an SSPR event happens. These notifications can cover both regular user accounts and admin accounts. For admin accounts, this notification provides another layer of awareness when a privileged administrator account password is reset using SSPR. Microsoft Entra ID can notify all Administrators when someone uses SSPR on an admin account.
From the menu on the left side of theNotificationspage, set up the following options:SetNotify users on password resets?option toYes.SetNotify all admins when other admins reset their password?toYes.
From the menu on the left side of theNotificationspage, set up the following options:
SetNotify users on password resets?option toYes.
SetNotify all admins when other admins reset their password?toYes.
To apply the notification preferences, selectSave.
To apply the notification preferences, selectSave.
If users need more help with the SSPR process, you can customize the "Contact your administrator" link. The user can select this link in the SSPR registration process and when they unlock their account or resets their password. To make sure your users get the support needed, we recommend you provide a custom helpdesk email or URL.
From the menu on the left side of theCustomizationpage, setCustomize helpdesk linktoYes.
In theCustom helpdesk email or URLfield, provide an email address or web page URL where your users can get more help from your organization, likehttps://support.contoso.com/
To apply the custom link, selectSave.
Test self-service password reset
With SSPR enabled and set up, test the SSPR process with a user that's part of the group you selected in the previous section, likeTest-SSPR-Group. The following example uses thetestuseraccount. Provide your own user account. It's part of the group you enabled for SSPR in the first section of this tutorial.
Note
When you test self-service password reset, use a non-administrator account. By default, Microsoft Entra ID enables self-service password reset for admins. They're required to use two authentication methods to reset their password. For more information, seeAdministrator reset policy differences.
To see the manual registration process, open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode, and browse tohttps://aka.ms/ssprsetup. Microsoft Entra ID directs users to this registration portal when they sign in next time.

In a later tutorial in this series, you set up password writeback. This feature writes password changes from Microsoft Entra SSPR back to an on-premises AD environment. If you want to continue with this tutorial series to set up password writeback, don't disable SSPR now.
If you no longer want to use the SSPR functionality you set up as part of this tutorial, set the SSPR status toNoneusing the following steps:
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least anAuthentication Policy Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Password reset.
From thePropertiespage, under the optionSelf service password reset enabled, selectNone.
To apply the SSPR change, selectSave.
FAQs
This section explains common questions from administrators and end-users who try SSPR:
Why aren't on-premises password policies displayed during SSPR?At this time, Microsoft Entra Connect and cloud sync don't support sharing password policy details with the cloud. SSPR only displays the cloud password policy details, and can't show on-premises policies.

At this time, Microsoft Entra Connect and cloud sync don't support sharing password policy details with the cloud. SSPR only displays the cloud password policy details, and can't show on-premises policies.
Why do federated users wait up to 2 minutes after they seeYour password has been resetbefore they can use passwords that are synchronized from on-premises?For federated users whose passwords are synchronized, the source of authority for the passwords is on-premises. As a result, SSPR updates only the on-premises passwords. Password hash synchronization back to Microsoft Entra ID is scheduled for every 2 minutes.

When some users go through SSPR process and reset their password, why don't they see the password strength indicator?Users who donât see weak/strong password strength have synchronized password writeback enabled. Since SSPR canât determine the password policy of the customerâs on-premises environment, it can't validate password strength or weakness.
