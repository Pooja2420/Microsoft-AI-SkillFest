This article describes how to register your SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) in bulk in Azure with theSQL IaaS Agent extensionby using theRegister-SqlVMsAzure PowerShell cmdlet.
Register-SqlVMs
Alternatively, you can registerall SQL Server VMs automaticallyorindividual SQL Server VMs manually.
Note
SQL Server VMs deployed via the Azure marketplace after October 2022 have theleast privileged modelenabled by default.Management modesfor the SQL IaaS Agent extension were removed in March 2023.
Overview
TheRegister-SqlVMscmdlet can be used to register all virtual machines in a given list of subscriptions, resource groups, or a list of specific virtual machines. The cmdlet will register the virtual machines and then generate both areport and a log file.
Register-SqlVMs
The registration process carries no risk, has no downtime, and will not restart the SQL Server service or the virtual machine.
By default, Azure VMs with SQL Server 2016 or later are automatically registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension when detected by theCEIP service. You can use bulk registration to register any SQL Server VMs that are not detected by the CEIP service.
For information about privacy, see theSQL IaaS Agent extension privacy statements.
Prerequisites
To register your SQL Server VM with the extension, you'll need the following:
AnAzure subscriptionthat has beenregistered with theMicrosoft.SqlVirtualMachineresource providerand contains unregistered SQL Server virtual machines.
Ensure the Azure VM is running.
The client credentials used to register the virtual machines exist in any of the following Azure roles:Virtual Machine contributor,Contributor, orOwner.
Az PowerShell 5.0- versions higher than 5.0 currently only support MFA and are not compatible with the script to register multiple VMs.
Get started
Before proceeding, you must first create a local copy of the script, import it as a PowerShell module, and connect to Azure.
Create the script
To create the script, copy thefull scriptfrom the end of this article and save it locally asRegisterSqlVMs.psm1.
RegisterSqlVMs.psm1
Import the script
After the script is created, you can import it as a module in the PowerShell terminal.
Open an administrative PowerShell terminal and navigate to where you saved theRegisterSqlVMs.psm1file. Then, run the following PowerShell cmdlet to import the script as a module:
RegisterSqlVMs.psm1
Import-Module .\RegisterSqlVMs.psm1
Import-Module .\RegisterSqlVMs.psm1
Connect to Azure
Use the following PowerShell cmdlet to connect to Azure:
Connect-AzAccount
Connect-AzAccount
All VMs in a list of subscriptions
Use the following cmdlet to register all SQL Server virtual machines in a list of subscriptions:
Register-SqlVMs -SubscriptionList SubscriptionId1,SubscriptionId2
Register-SqlVMs -SubscriptionList SubscriptionId1,SubscriptionId2

Output description
Both a report and a log file are generated every time theRegister-SqlVMscmdlet is used.
Register-SqlVMs
Report
The report is generated as a.txtfile namedRegisterSqlVMScriptReport<Timestamp>.txtwhere the timestamp is the time when the cmdlet was started. The report lists the following details:
.txt
RegisterSqlVMScriptReport<Timestamp>.txt
SubscriptionID, Resource Group, Virtual Machine
SubscriptionID, Resource Group, Virtual Machine
Log
Errors are logged in the log file namedVMsNotRegisteredDueToError<Timestamp>.log, where timestamp is the time when the script started. If the error is at the subscription level, the log contains the comma-separated Subscription ID and the error message. If the error is with the virtual machine registration, the log contains the Subscription ID, Resource group name, virtual machine name, error code, and message separated by commas.
VMsNotRegisteredDueToError<Timestamp>.log
Remarks
When you register SQL Server VMs with the extension by using the provided script, consider the following:
Registration with the extension requires a guest agent running on the SQL Server VM. Windows Server 2008 images do not have a guest agent, so these virtual machines will fail and must beregistered manuallywithlimited functionality.
There is retry logic built-in to overcome transparent errors. If the virtual machine is successfully registered, then it is a rapid operation. However, if the registration fails, then each virtual machine will be retried.  As such, you should allow significant time to complete the registration process -  though actual time requirement is dependent on the type and number of errors.
