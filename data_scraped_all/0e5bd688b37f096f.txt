Azure Site Recovery allows you to useAzure Private Linkprivate endpoints for replicating your machines from inside an isolated virtual network. Private endpoint access to a recovery vault is supported in all Azure Commercial & Government regions.
This article provides instructions for you to perform the following steps:
Create an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault to protect your machines.
Enable a managed identity for the vault and grant the required permissions to access customer
storage accounts to replicate traffic from source to target locations. Managed identity access for
storage is necessary when you're setting up Private Link access to the vault.
Make DNS changes required for private endpoints
Create and approve private endpoints for a vault inside a virtual network
Create private endpoints for the storage accounts. You can continue to allow public or firewalled
access for storage as needed. Creation of a private endpoint for accessing storage isn't mandatory
for Azure Site Recovery.
Following is a reference architecture on how the replication workflow changes with private endpoints.

Prerequisites and caveats
Private endpoints:Private endpoints can be created only for new Recovery Services vaults that don't have any items registered to the vault. As such, private endpointsmust be created before any items are added to the vault. Review the pricing structure forprivate endpoints.Private endpoint for Recovery Services only supports dynamic IP addresses. Static IP addresses are not supported.When a private endpoint is created for a vault, the vault is locked down andisn't accessible from networks other than those networks that have private endpoints.Private endpoints for storage can only be created on General Purpose v2 type. Review the pricing structure fordata transfer on GPv2.

Microsoft Entra IDcurrently doesn't support private endpoints. As such, IPs and fully qualified domain names required for Microsoft Entra ID to work in a region need to be allowed outbound access from the secured network. You can also use network security group tagAzure Active Directoryand Azure Firewall tags for allowing access to Microsoft Entra ID, as applicable.
Azure Active Directory
IP addresses:At least nine IP addresses are requiredin the subnets of both your source machines and your recovery machines. When you create a private endpoint for the vault, Site Recovery creates five private links for access to its microservices. Further, when you enable the replication, it adds two additional private links for the source and target region pairing.One additional IP address is requiredin both the source and recovery subnets. This IP address is needed only when you need to use private endpoints connecting to cache storage accounts.

Creating and using private endpoints for Site Recovery
This section talks about the steps involved in creating and using private endpoints for Azure Site Recovery inside your virtual networks.
Note
It's highly recommended that you follow these steps in the same sequence as provided. Failure to
do so may lead to the vault being rendered unable to use private endpoints and requiring you to
restart the process with a new vault.
Create a Recovery Services vault
A recovery services vault is an entity that contains the replication information of machines and is
used to trigger Site Recovery operations. For more information, seeCreate a Recovery Services vault.
Enable the managed identity for the vault.
Amanaged identityallow the
vault to gain access to the customer's storage accounts. Site Recovery needs to access the source
storage, target storage, and cache/log storage accounts depending on the scenario requirement.
Managed identity access is essential when you're using private links service for the vault.

Create private endpoints for the Recovery Services vault
To enable both failover and failback for Azure virtual machines, you'll need two private endpoints
for the vault. One private endpoint for the protection of machines in the source network and another
for the reprotection of failed over machines in the recovery network.
Ensure that you create a recovery virtual network in your target region as well during this setup
process.
Note
Currently, you can't configure an automation account to use private endpoints for auto agent upgrade. This configuration requires to set up a private endpoint for the vault, however, Automation account cloud jobs can't access Azure resources secured with private endpoints.
Create the first private endpoint for your vault inside your source virtual network using the
Private Link Center in the portal or throughAzure PowerShell. Create the second private
endpoint for the vault inside your recovery network. Following are the steps to create the private
endpoint in source network. Repeat the same guidance to create the second private endpoint.
In the Azure portal search bar, search for and select "Private Link". This action takes you to
the Private Link Center.

the same vault. If you choose an existing private DNS zone, the previous CNAME records are
overwritten. Refer toPrivate endpoint guidancebefore you continue.If your environment has a hub and spoke model, you need only one private endpoint and only one
private DNS zone for the entire setup since all your virtual networks already have peering
enabled between them. For more information, seePrivate endpoint DNS integration.To manually create the private DNS zone, follow the steps inCreate private DNS zones and add DNS records manually.Tags: Optionally, you can add tags for your private endpoint.Review + create: When the validation completes, selectCreateto create the private

Once the private endpoint is created, five fully qualified domain names are added to the private
endpoint. These links enable the machines in the virtual network to get access to all the required
Site Recovery microservices in the context of the vault. Later, when you enable the replication, two
additional fully qualified domain names are added to the same private endpoint.
The five domain names are formatted with the following pattern:
{Vault-ID}-asr-pod01-{type}-.{target-geo-code}.privatelink.siterecovery.windowsazure.com
{Vault-ID}-asr-pod01-{type}-.{target-geo-code}.privatelink.siterecovery.windowsazure.com
Approve private endpoints for Site Recovery
If the user creating the private endpoint is also the owner of the Recovery Services vault, the
private endpoint created above is auto approved within a few minutes. Otherwise, the owner of the
vault must approve the private endpoint before you to use it. To approve or reject a requested
private endpoint connection, go toPrivate endpoint connectionsunder "Settings" on the recovery
vault page.
You can go to the private endpoint resource to review the status of the connection before
proceeding.

(Optional) Create private endpoints for the cache storage account
A private endpoint to Azure Storage may be used. Creating private endpoints for storage access isoptionalfor Azure Site Recovery replication. When creating a private endpoint for storage, the
following requirements apply:
You need a private endpoint for the cache/log storage account in your source virtual network.
You need a second private endpoint at the time of reprotection of the failed-over machines in the
recovery network. This private endpoint is for the new storage account created in the target
region.
Note
If private endpoints are not enabled on storage account, protection would still be successful. However, replication traffic would transit to Azure Site Recovery public endpoints. To ensure replication traffic flows via private links, storage account must be enabled with private endpoints.
Private endpoint for storage can only be created on aGeneral Purpose v2storage accounts. For pricing information, seeStandard page blob prices.
For Cache Storage Account, assigning a Private Endpoint (PE) to the cache storage account and adding a static IP functions correctly if the source machine maintains a network line of sight. This doesn't apply to Site Recovery.
Follow theguidance for creation of private storageto create a storage account with private endpoint. Ensure to selectYesto integration with
private DNS zone. Select an already created DNS zone or create a new one.
Grant required permissions to the vault
If your virtual machines are using managed disks, you need to grant the managed identity permissions
only to the cache storage accounts. In case the virtual machines are using unmanaged disks, you need
to grant the managed identity permissions for source, cache, and target storage accounts. In this
case, you need to create the target storage account in advance.
Before enabling replication of virtual machines, the managed identity of the vault must have the
following role permissions depending on the type of storage account:
Resource Manager based storage accounts (Standard Type):ContributorStorage Blob Data Contributor
Contributor
Storage Blob Data Contributor
Resource Manager based storage accounts (Premium Type):ContributorStorage Blob Data Owner
Contributor
Storage Blob Data Owner
Classic storage accounts:Classic Storage Account ContributorClassic Storage Account Key Operator Service Role

Protect your virtual machines
Once all the above configurations are completed, continue with enabling replication for your virtual
machines. All of the Site Recovery operations work without any additional steps if DNS integration
was used while creating private endpoints on the vault. However, if the DNS zones are manually
created and configured, you need additional steps to add specific DNS records in both source and
target DNS zones after enabling the replication. For details and steps, seeCreate private DNS zones and add DNS records manually.
