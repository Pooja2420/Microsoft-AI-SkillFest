You can configure your Virtual WAN VPN gateway with static one-to-one NAT rules. A NAT rule provides a mechanism to set up one-to-one translation of IP addresses. NAT can be used to interconnect two IP networks that have incompatible or overlapping IP addresses. A typical scenario is branches with overlapping IPs that want to access Azure VNet resources.
This configuration uses a flow table to route traffic from an external (host) IP Address to an internal IP address associated with an endpoint inside a virtual network (virtual machine, computer, container, etc.).

To use NAT, VPN devices need to use any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors. Policy Based (narrow) traffic selectors aren't supported in conjunction with NAT configuration.
Configure NAT rules
You can configure and view NAT rules on your VPN gateway settings at any time.
NAT type: static & dynamic
NAT on a gateway device translates the source and/or destination IP addresses, based on the NAT policies or rules to avoid address conflict. There are different types of NAT translation rules:
Static NAT: Static rules define a fixed address mapping relationship. For a given IP address, it will be mapped to the same address from the target pool. The mappings for static rules are stateless because the mapping is fixed. For example, a NAT rule created to map 10.0.0.0/24 to 192.168.0.0/24 will have a fixed 1-1 mapping. 10.0.0.0 is translated to 192.168.0.0, 10.0.0.1 is translated to 192.168.0.1, and so on.

The mappings for static rules are stateless because the mapping is fixed. For example, a NAT rule created to map 10.0.0.0/24 to 192.168.0.0/24 will have a fixed 1-1 mapping. 10.0.0.0 is translated to 192.168.0.0, 10.0.0.1 is translated to 192.168.0.1, and so on.
Dynamic NAT: For dynamic NAT, an IP address can be translated to different target IP addresses and TCP/UDP port based on availability, or with a different combination of IP address and TCP/UDP port. The latter is also called NAPT, Network Address and Port Translation. Dynamic rules will result in stateful translation mappings depending on the traffic flows at any given time. Due to the nature of Dynamic NAT and the ever-changing IP/Port combinations, flows that make use of Dynamic NAT rules have to be initiated from theInternal Mapping(Pre-NAT) IP Range. The dynamic mapping is released once the flow is disconnected or gracefully terminated.

The dynamic mapping is released once the flow is disconnected or gracefully terminated.
Another consideration is the address pool size for translation. If the target address pool size is the same as the original address pool, use static NAT rule to define a 1:1 mapping in a sequential order. If the target address pool is smaller than the original address pool, use dynamic NAT rule to accommodate the differences.
Note
Site-to-site NAT is not supported with site-to-site VPN connections where policy-based traffic selectors are used.

Note
If you want the site-to-site VPN gateway to advertise translated (External Mapping) address prefixes via BGP, click theEnable BGP Translationbutton, due to which on-premises will automatically learn the post-NAT range of Egress Rules and Azure (Virtual WAN hub, connected virtual networks, VPN and ExpressRoute branches) will automatically learn the post-NAT range of Ingress rules. The new POST NAT ranges will be shown on the Effective Routes table in a virtual hub. TheEnable Bgp Translationsetting is applied to all NAT rules on the Virtual WAN hub site-to-site VPN gateway.
Example configurations
Ingress SNAT (BGP-enabled VPN site)
Ingress SNAT rulesare applied on packets that are entering Azure through the Virtual WAN site-to-site VPN gateway. In this scenario, you want to connect two site-to-site VPN branches to Azure. VPN Site 1 connects via Link A, and VPN Site 2 connects via Link B. Each site has the same address space 10.30.0.0/24.
In this example, we'll NAT site1 to 172.30.0.0.0/24. The Virtual WAN spoke virtual networks and branches other will automatically learn this post-NAT address space.
The following diagram shows the projected result:

IfBGP Translationis enabled, the site-to-site VPN gateway will automatically advertise theExternal MappingofEgress NAT rulesto on-premises as well asExternal MappingofIngress NAT rulesto Azure (virtual WAN hub, connected spoke virtual networks, connected VPN/ExpressRoute). IfBGP Translationis disabled, translated routes aren't automatically advertised to the on-premises. As such, the on-premises BGP speaker must be configured to advertise the post-NAT (External Mapping) range ofIngress NATrules associated to that VPN site link connection. Similarly, a route for the post-NAT (External Mapping) range ofEgress NAT Rulesmust be applied on the on-premises device.

In Dynamic NAT, on-premises BGP peer IP can't be part of the pre-NAT address range (Internal Mapping) as IP and port translations aren't fixed.

Ingress SNAT (VPN site with statically configured routes)
Ingress SNAT rulesare applied on packets that are entering Azure through the Virtual WAN site-to-site VPN gateway. In this scenario, you want to connect two site-to-site VPN branches to Azure. VPN Site 1 connects via Link A, and VPN Site 2 connects via Link B. Each site has the same address space 10.30.0.0/24.
In this example, we'll NAT VPN site 1 to 172.30.0.0.0/24. However, because the VPN Site isn't connected to the site-to-site VPN gateway via BGP, the configuration steps are slightly different than the BGP-enabled example.

Verification checks
This section shows checks to verify that your configuration is set up properly.
Use Dynamic NAT Rules if the target address pool is smaller than the original address pool.
Use Dynamic NAT Rules if the target address pool is smaller than the original address pool.
As IP/Port combinations aren't fixed in a Dynamic NAT Rule, the on-premises BGP Peer IP can't be part of the pre-NAT (Internal Mapping) address range. Create a specific Static NAT Rule that translates the BGP Peering IP address only.For example:On-premises address range:10.0.0.0/24On-premises BGP IP:10.0.0.1Ingress Dynamic NAT rule:192.168.0.1/32Ingress Static NAT rule:10.0.0.1 -> 192.168.0.2
As IP/Port combinations aren't fixed in a Dynamic NAT Rule, the on-premises BGP Peer IP can't be part of the pre-NAT (Internal Mapping) address range. Create a specific Static NAT Rule that translates the BGP Peering IP address only.
For example:
On-premises address range:10.0.0.0/24
On-premises BGP IP:10.0.0.1
Ingress Dynamic NAT rule:192.168.0.1/32
Ingress Static NAT rule:10.0.0.1 -> 192.168.0.2
Branches in Virtual WAN associate to theDefaultRouteTable, implying all branch connections learn routes that are populated within the DefaultRouteTable. You'll see the NAT rule with the translated prefix in the effective routes of the DefaultRouteTable.
From the previous example:
Prefix:172.30.0.0/24
Next Hop Type:VPN_S2S_Gateway
Next Hop:VPN_S2S_Gateway Resource
This example applies to resources in virtual networks that are associated with the DefaultRouteTable.
TheEffective Routeson Network Interface Cards (NIC) of any virtual machine that is sitting in a spoke virtual network connected to the virtual WAN hub should also contain the address prefixes of theExternal Mappingspecified in theIngress NAT rule.
The on-premises device should also contain routes for prefixes contained within theExternal MappingofEgress NAT rules.
Note
Site-to-site NAT is not supported with site-to-site VPN connections where policy-based traffic selectors are used.
The following table shows common configuration patterns that arise when configuring different types of NAT rules on the site-to-site VPN gateway.
