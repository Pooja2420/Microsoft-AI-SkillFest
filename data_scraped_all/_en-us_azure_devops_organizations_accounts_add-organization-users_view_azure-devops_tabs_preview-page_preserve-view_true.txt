Learn how to add users to your organization and manage user access through direct assignment. For an overview of adding users and related concepts, seeAbout organization management in Azure DevOps. Users can include human users, service accounts, andservice principals.
The following types of users can join your organization for free:
Five users who getBasic features, such as version control, tools for Agile, Java, build, release, and more
Unlimited users who getStakeholder features, such as working with your backlog, work items, and queries. Don't use Stakeholder access as a substitute for more limited permissions, as users with a Visual Studio subscription or a GitHub Enterprise license automatically get upgraded from Stakeholder when they sign in. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.
UnlimitedVisual Studio subscriberswho also get Basic or Basic + Test Plan features, depending on their subscription level.
UnlimitedGitHub Enterprise userswho also get Basic features when they sign in with their GitHub Enterprise account.

Prerequisites
For an overview of the methods supported for adding users to an organization, seeAdd and manage user access.
Add users to your organization
Administrators can efficiently manage user access by adding users to an organization. Provide access to the appropriate tooling extensions and service access levels, and assign users to relevant groupsâall from a single view. This streamlined process ensures that new users have the necessary permissions and resources to start contributing immediately.
Note
If you have a Microsoft Entra ID-backed organization and need to add users who are external to Microsoft Entra ID, firstadd external users. On theTell us about this userpage, underType of user, chooseUser with an existing Microsoft account. After completing those steps, follow these instructions to add the Microsoft Entra ID user to Azure DevOps.
You can add up to 50 users in a single transaction. When you add users, each user receives a notification email with a link to the organization page, allowing them to easily access and start using the organization's resources.

Add a user
You can add users to an organization by using theaz devops user addcommand. To get started, seeAzure DevOps CLI.
az devops user add â-email-id 
		   --license-type {advanced, earlyAdopter, express, professional, stakeholder}
		   [--send-email-invite {false, true}]
           [--org]
az devops user add â-email-id 
		   --license-type {advanced, earlyAdopter, express, professional, stakeholder}
		   [--send-email-invite {false, true}]
           [--org]
email-id: Required. Enter the Microsoft account's email address for the user organization.

Restrict user visibility to organization and project information
To restrict certain users' access to organizational information, enable theLimit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectspreview feature and add the users to theProject-Scoped Usersgroup. Once added, users in that group can't access projects that they aren't explicitly added to.
Note
Users and groups added to theProject-Scoped Usersgroup get limited access to project and organization information. They also get restricted access to specific identities through the people picker. For more information, seeLimit user visibility for projects, and more.
To add users to the newProject-Scoped Usersgroup, do the following steps:
Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}).

Users in the limited group can only select users who are explicitly added to Azure DevOps and not users who have access through Microsoft Entra group membership.
Guest users who are members in the limited group with default access in Microsoft Entra ID, can't search for users with the people picker.
FAQs
Q: Why does the permissions level show as 'Custom' when I add a user to a project in the Users Hub?
A:By design, the permissions settings accessible via the Users Hub are intended to provide a quick way to set user permissions after they get added. However, these settings don't override custom permissions that might be assigned through group membership or direct assignments in other areas.
For example, if a user is designated as a standard contributor in a project but is also granted a specific permission, such as "Allow force push" for a repository within that project, the Users Hub  displays their permission level as 'Custom.' So, any changes made in the Users Hub don't revert the permission display back to 'Contributor' or any other standard role.
So, if you see 'Custom' in the Users Hub, it indicates that there are other permissions assigned to the user that don't reflect in the standard role settings. To modify these permissions, go to the specific project settings or group memberships where these custom permissions got assigned.
Q: Which email addresses can I add?
A:
If your organization is connected to Microsoft Entra ID, you can only add email addresses that are internal to the directory.Add email addresses of users who have"personal" Microsoft accountsunless you authenticate users and control access throughMicrosoft Entra IDusing your organization's directory.
Add email addresses of users who have"personal" Microsoft accountsunless you authenticate users and control access throughMicrosoft Entra IDusing your organization's directory.
If your organization is connected to your directory, all users must be directory members. They must sign in to Azure DevOps with work or school accounts managed by your directory. If they aren't members, they need to beadded to the directory.

After you add members to your project, each member receives an invitation email with a link to your organization. They can use this link to sign in and access your project. First-time members might get asked for more details when they sign in to personalize their experience.
Q: What if users don't get or lose the invitation email?
A:
ForOrganizations connected to Microsoft Entra ID: If you'reinviting users from outside your Microsoft Entra ID, they must use their email. Removing users from the organization removes both their access and their license. However, any artifacts assigned to them remain unchanged. You can always invite users back into the organization if they exist in the Microsoft Entra tenant. After they're removed from Microsoft Entra ID, you can't assign any new artifacts (work items, pull requests, and so on) to them. The history of artifacts already assigned to the users is preserved.

After they're removed from Microsoft Entra ID, you can't assign any new artifacts (work items, pull requests, and so on) to them. The history of artifacts already assigned to the users is preserved.
ForOrganizations with Microsoft accounts: You can send a link to the project page, included in the invitation email, to new team members. Removing users from the organization removes both their access and their licenses. You can no longer assign any new artifacts (work items, pull requests, and so on) to these users. However, any artifacts previously assigned to them remain unchanged.

Q: Why can't I add any more members?
A:SeeQ: Why can't I add any more members to my project?.
Q: How isaccessdifferent frompermissions?
A:Access levels determine a user's access to specific web portal features based on their subscription. Permissions control a user's ability to perform specific operations, which get governed by security group membership or specific Access Control Level (ACL) assignments made to a user or group.
