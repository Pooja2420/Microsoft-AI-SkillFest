Azure Artifacts feeds are organizational constructs that allow you to store, manage, and share your packages while controlling access. Feeds are not limited to specific package types; you can store various types, such as npm, NuGet, Maven, and Python packages, in a single feed.
Project-scoped vs Organization-scoped feeds
Organization-scoped feeds are accessible and viewable from any project within the organization. Project-scoped feeds on the other hand, are restricted to being viewed solely within the hosting project.
It's important to note that organization-scoped feeds cannot be converted into project-scoped feeds. Furthermore, only project-scoped feeds have the capability to be designated aspublic feeds. For a detailed comparison between project-scoped and organization-scoped feeds, refer toFeeds scope.
Note
To access a feed in a different organization, a user must be granted access to the project hosting that feed.

Public feeds are only available in Azure DevOps Services.
Public feeds
Public feeds allow you to share your packages publicly with anyone on the internet. Users do not need to be members of your organization, nor do they need to log in to the Azure DevOps portal to access the packages.
Public feeds areproject-scopedand inherit the visibility settings of the hosting project. Here are some important points to note about public feeds:
Public feeds can only be created within public projects.
Public feeds are not intended to replace existing package management platforms (such as NuGet.org, npmjs.com, etc.).
Public users currently cannot download universal packages, but all other package types are supported for public access.
Note
All feed views in a public feed are accessible to everyone on the internet.
