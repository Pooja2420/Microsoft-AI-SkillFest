APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
Theset-headerpolicy assigns a value to an existing HTTP response and/or request header or adds a new response and/or request header.
set-header
Use the policy to insert a list of HTTP headers into an HTTP message. When placed in an inbound pipeline, this policy sets the HTTP headers for the request being passed to the target service. When placed in an outbound pipeline, this policy sets the HTTP headers for the response being sent to the gatewayâs client.
Note
Set the policy's elements and child elements in the order provided in the policy statement. To help you configure this policy, the portal provides a guided, form-based editor. Learn more abouthow to set or edit API Management policies.
Policy statement
<set-header name="header name" exists-action="override | skip | append | delete">
    <value>value</value> <!--for multiple headers with the same name add additional value elements-->
</set-header>
<set-header name="header name" exists-action="override | skip | append | delete">
    <value>value</value> <!--for multiple headers with the same name add additional value elements-->
</set-header>

Gateways:classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted, workspace
Usage notes
Multiple values of a header are concatenated to a CSV string, for example:
headerName: value1,value2,value3
headerName: value1,value2,value3
Exceptions include standardized headers whose values:
may contain commas (User-Agent,WWW-Authenticate,Proxy-Authenticate)
User-Agent
WWW-Authenticate
Proxy-Authenticate
may contain date (Cookie,Set-Cookie,Warning),
Cookie
Set-Cookie
Warning
contain date (Date,Expires,If-Modified-Since,If-Unmodified-Since,Last-Modified,Retry-After).
Date
Expires
If-Modified-Since
If-Unmodified-Since
Last-Modified
Retry-After
In case of those exceptions, multiple header values won't be concatenated into one string and will be passed as separate headers, for example:
User-Agent: value1
User-Agent: value2
User-Agent: value3
User-Agent: value1
User-Agent: value2
User-Agent: value3
The following limitations apply:

Examples
Add header, override existing
<set-header name="some header name" exists-action="override">
    <value>20</value>
</set-header>
<set-header name="some header name" exists-action="override">
    <value>20</value>
</set-header>
Remove header
<set-header name="some header name" exists-action="delete" />
<set-header name="some header name" exists-action="delete" />
Forward context information to the backend service
This example shows how to apply policy at the API level to supply context information to the backend service.
<!-- Copy this snippet into the inbound element to forward some context information, user id and the region the gateway is hosted in, to the backend service for logging or evaluation -->
<set-header name="x-request-context-data" exists-action="override">
  <value>@(context.User.Id)</value>
  <value>@(context.Deployment.Region)</value>
</set-header>
<!-- Copy this snippet into the inbound element to forward some context information, user id and the region the gateway is hosted in, to the backend service for logging or evaluation -->
<set-header name="x-request-context-data" exists-action="override">
  <value>@(context.User.Id)</value>
  <value>@(context.Deployment.Region)</value>
</set-header>
