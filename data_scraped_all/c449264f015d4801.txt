You can change the service level of an existing volume by moving the volume to another capacity pool in the same NetApp account that uses theservice levelyou want for the volume. This in-place service-level change for the volume doesn't require that you migrate data. It also doesn't affect access to the volume.
This functionality enables you to meet your workload needs on demand. You can change an existing volume to use a higher service level for better performance, or to use a lower service level for cost optimization. For example, if the volume is in a capacity pool that uses theStandardservice level and you want the volume to use thePremiumservice level, you can move the volume dynamically to a capacity pool that uses thePremiumservice level.
The capacity pool that you want to move the volume to must already exist. The capacity pool can contain other volumes. If you want to move the volume to a brand-new capacity pool, you need tocreate the capacity poolbefore you move the volume.
Considerations
Dynamically changing the service level of a volume is supported within the same NetApp account. You can't move the volume to a capacity pool in a different NetApp Account.

You can't convert a Flexible service level capacity pool to Standard, Premium, or Ultra. Standard, Premium, and Ultra service level capacity pools can't be converted to the Flexible service level.

After the volume is moved to another capacity pool, you no longer have access to the previous volume activity logs and volume metrics. The volume starts with new activity logs and metrics under the new capacity pool.

If you move a volume to a capacity pool of a higher service level (for example, moving fromStandardtoPremiumorUltraservice level), you must wait at least 24 hours before you can move that volumeagainto a capacity pool of a lower service level (for example, moving fromUltratoPremiumorStandard). You can always change to higher service level without wait time.

If the target capacity pool is of themanualQoS type, the volume's throughput isn't changed with the volume move. You canmodify the allotted throughputin the target manual capacity pool.

Regardless of the source poolâs QoS type, when the target pool is of theautoQoS type, the volume's throughput is changed with the move to match the service level of the target capacity pool.
