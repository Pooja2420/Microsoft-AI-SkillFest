Azure Machine Learning requires access to servers and services on the public internet. When implementing network isolation, you need to understand what access is required and how to enable it.
Note
The information in this article applies to Azure Machine Learning workspace configured to use anAzure Virtual Network. When using amanaged virtual network, the required inbound and outbound configuration for the workspace is automatically applied. For more information, seeAzure Machine Learning managed virtual network.
Common terms and information
The following terms and information are used throughout this article:
Azure service tags: A service tag is an easy way to specify the IP ranges used by an Azure service. For example, theAzureMachineLearningtag represents the IP addresses used by the Azure Machine Learning service.ImportantAzure service tags are only supported by some Azure services. For a list of service tags supported with network security groups and Azure Firewall, see theVirtual network service tagsarticle.If you're using a non-Azure solution such as a 3rd party firewall, download a list ofAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags. Extract the file and search for the service tag within the file. The IP addresses might change periodically.

Region: Some service tags allow you to specify an Azure region. This limits access to the service IP addresses in a specific region, usually the one that your service is in. In this article, when you see<region>, substitute your Azure region instead. For example,BatchNodeManagement.<region>would beBatchNodeManagement.uswestif your Azure Machine Learning workspace is in the US West region.

Basic configuration
This configuration makes the following assumptions:
You're using docker images provided by a container registry that you provide, and don't use images provided by Microsoft.
You're using a private Python package repository, and don't access public package repositories such aspypi.org,*.anaconda.com, or*.anaconda.org.
pypi.org
*.anaconda.com
*.anaconda.org
The private endpoints can communicate directly with each other within the VNet. For example, all services have a private endpoint in the same VNet:Azure Machine Learning workspaceAzure Storage Account (blob, file, table, queue)
Azure Machine Learning workspace
Azure Storage Account (blob, file, table, queue)
Inbound traffic

Tip
A network security group (NSG) is created by default for this traffic. For more information, seeDefault security rules.
Outbound traffic

AzureMonitor
VirtualNetwork
Important
If a compute instance or compute cluster is configured for no public IP, by default it can't access the internet. If itcanstill send outbound traffic to the internet, it is because of Azuredefault outbound accessand you have an NSG that allows outbound to the internet. Wedon't recommendusing the default outbound access. If you need outbound access to the internet, we recommend using one of the following options instead of the default outbound access:
Azure Virtual Network NAT with a public IP: For more information on using Virtual Network Nat, see theVirtual Network NATdocumentation.
User-defined route and firewall: Create a user-defined route in the subnet that contains the compute. TheNext hopfor the route should reference the private IP address of the firewall, with an address prefix of 0.0.0.0/0.
For more information, see theDefault outbound access in Azurearticle.
Recommended configuration for training and deploying models
Outbound traffic
MicrosoftContainerRegistry
AzureFrontDoor.FirstParty
To allow installation of Python packages for training and deployment, allowoutboundtraffic to the following host names:
Note
The following list doesn't contain all of the hosts required for all Python resources on the internet, only the most commonly used. For example, if you need access to a GitHub repository or other host, you must identify and add the required hosts for that scenario.
anaconda.com
*.anaconda.com
*.anaconda.org
pypi.org
*.pythonhosted.org
pytorch.org
*.pytorch.org
*.tensorflow.org
Scenario: Install RStudio on compute instance
To allow installation of RStudio on a compute instance, the firewall needs to allow outbound access to the sites to pull the Docker image from. Add the following Application rule to your Azure Firewall policy:
Name: AllowRStudioInstall
Source Type: IP Address
Source IP Addresses: The IP address range of the subnet where you create the compute instance. For example,172.16.0.0/24.
172.16.0.0/24
Destination Type: FQDN
Target FQDN:ghcr.io,pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com
ghcr.io
pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com
Protocol:Https:443
Https:443
To allow the installation of R packages, allowoutboundtraffic tocloud.r-project.org. This host is used for installing CRAN packages.
cloud.r-project.org
Note
If you need access to a GitHub repository or other host, you must identify and add the required hosts for that scenario.
Scenario: Using compute cluster or compute instance with a public IP
Important
A compute instance or compute cluster without a public IP doesn't need inbound traffic from Azure Batch management and Azure Machine Learning services. However, if you have multiple computes and some of them use a public IP address, you need to allow this traffic.
When using Azure Machine Learningcompute instanceorcompute cluster(with a public IP address), allow inbound traffic from the Azure Machine Learning service. A compute instance or compute clusterwith no public IPdoesn'trequire this inbound communication. A Network Security Group allowing this traffic is dynamically created for you, however you might need to also create user-defined routes (UDR) if you have a firewall. When creating a UDR for this traffic, you can use eitherIP Addressesorservice tagsto route the traffic.
IP Address routes
Service tag routes
For the Azure Machine Learning service, you must add the IP address of both theprimaryandsecondaryregions. To find the secondary region, see theCross-region replication in Azure. For example, if your Azure Machine Learning service is in East US 2, the secondary region is Central US.
To get a list of IP addresses of the Azure Machine Learning service, download theAzure IP Ranges and Service Tagsand search the file forAzureMachineLearning.<region>, where<region>is your Azure region.
AzureMachineLearning.<region>
<region>
Important
The IP addresses may change over time.
When creating the UDR, set theNext hop typetoInternet. This means the inbound communication from Azure skips your firewall to access the load balancers with public IPs of Compute Instance and Compute Cluster. UDR is required because Compute Instance and Compute Cluster will get random public IPs at creation, and you cannot know the public IPs before creation to register them on your firewall to allow the inbound from Azure to specific IPs for Compute Instance and Compute Cluster. The following image shows an example IP address based UDR in the Azure portal:

Create user-defined routes for theAzureMachineLearningservice tag.
AzureMachineLearning
The following command demonstrates adding a route for this service tag:
az network route-table route create -g MyResourceGroup --route-table-name MyRouteTable -n AzureMLRoute --address-prefix AzureMachineLearning --next-hop-type Internet
az network route-table route create -g MyResourceGroup --route-table-name MyRouteTable -n AzureMLRoute --address-prefix AzureMachineLearning --next-hop-type Internet
For information on configuring UDR, seeRoute network traffic with a routing table.
Scenario: Firewall between Azure Machine Learning and Azure Storage endpoints
You must also allowoutboundaccess toStorage.<region>onport 445.
Storage.<region>
Scenario: Workspace created with thehbi_workspaceflag enabled
hbi_workspace
You must also allowoutboundaccess toKeyvault.<region>. This outbound traffic is used to access the key vault instance for the back-end Azure Batch service.
Keyvault.<region>
For more information on thehbi_workspaceflag, see thedata encryptionarticle.
hbi_workspace
Scenario: Use Kubernetes compute
Kubernetes Clusterrunning behind an outbound proxy server or firewall needs extra egress network configuration.
For Kubernetes with Azure Arc connection, configure theAzure Arc network requirementsneeded by Azure Arc agents.
For AKS cluster without Azure Arc connection, configure theAKS extension network requirements.
Besides above requirements, the following outbound URLs are also required for Azure Machine Learning,
*.kusto.windows.net
*.table.core.windows.net
*.queue.core.windows.net

In-cluster communication requirements
To install the Azure Machine Learning extension on Kubernetes compute, all Azure Machine Learning related components are deployed in aazuremlnamespace. The following in-cluster communication is needed to ensure the ML workloads work well in the AKS cluster.
azureml
The components inazuremlnamespace should be able to communicate with Kubernetes API server.
azureml
The components inazuremlnamespace should be able to communicate with each other.
azureml
The components inazuremlnamespace should be able to communicate withkube-dnsandkonnectivity-agentinkube-systemnamespace.
azureml
kube-dns
konnectivity-agent
kube-system
If the cluster is used for real-time inferencing,azureml-fe-xxxPODs should be able to communicate with the deployed model PODs on 5001 port in other namespace.azureml-fe-xxxPODs should open 11001, 12001, 12101, 12201, 20000, 8000, 8001, 9001 ports for internal communication.
azureml-fe-xxx
azureml-fe-xxx
If the cluster is used for real-time inferencing, the deployed model PODs should be able to communicate withamlarc-identity-proxy-xxxPODs on 9999 port.

Scenario: Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code relies on specific hosts and ports to establish a remote connection.
Hosts
The hosts in this section are used to install Visual Studio Code packages to establish a remote connection between Visual Studio Code and compute instances in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
Note
This is not a complete list of the hosts required for all Visual Studio Code resources on the internet, only the most commonly used. For example, if you need access to a GitHub repository or other host, you must identify and add the required hosts for that scenario. For a complete list of host names, seeNetwork Connections in Visual Studio Code.

vscode.download.prss.microsoft.com
Ports
You must allow network traffic to ports 8704 to 8710. The VS Code server dynamically selects the first available port within this range.
Scenario: Third party firewall or Azure Firewall without service tags
The guidance in this section is generic, as each firewall has its own terminology and specific configurations. If you have questions, check the documentation for the firewall you're using.
Tip
If you're usingAzure Firewall, and want to use the FQDNs listed in this section instead of using service tags, use the following guidance:
FQDNs that use HTTP/S ports (80 and 443) should be configured asapplication rules.
FQDNs that use other ports should be configured asnetwork rules.
For more information, seeDifferences in application rules vs. network rules.
If not configured correctly, the firewall can cause problems using your workspace. There are various host names that are used both by the Azure Machine Learning workspace. The following sections list hosts that are required for Azure Machine Learning.
Dependencies API
You can also use the Azure Machine Learning REST API to get a list of hosts and ports that you must allowoutboundtraffic to. To use this API, use the following steps:
Get an authentication token. The following command demonstrates using theAzure CLIto get an authentication token and subscription ID:TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken -o tsv)
SUBSCRIPTION=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
Get an authentication token. The following command demonstrates using theAzure CLIto get an authentication token and subscription ID:
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken -o tsv)
SUBSCRIPTION=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken -o tsv)
SUBSCRIPTION=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
Call the API. In the following command, replace the following values:Replace<region>with the Azure region your workspace is in. For example,westus2.Replace<resource-group>with the resource group that contains your workspace.Replace<workspace-name>with the name of your workspace.az rest --method GET \
    --url "https://<region>.api.azureml.ms/rp/workspaces/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace-name>/outboundNetworkDependenciesEndpoints?api-version=2018-03-01-preview" \
    --header Authorization="Bearer $TOKEN"
Call the API. In the following command, replace the following values:
Replace<region>with the Azure region your workspace is in. For example,westus2.
<region>
westus2
Replace<resource-group>with the resource group that contains your workspace.
<resource-group>
Replace<workspace-name>with the name of your workspace.
<workspace-name>
az rest --method GET \
    --url "https://<region>.api.azureml.ms/rp/workspaces/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace-name>/outboundNetworkDependenciesEndpoints?api-version=2018-03-01-preview" \
    --header Authorization="Bearer $TOKEN"
az rest --method GET \
    --url "https://<region>.api.azureml.ms/rp/workspaces/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace-name>/outboundNetworkDependenciesEndpoints?api-version=2018-03-01-preview" \
    --header Authorization="Bearer $TOKEN"

Microsoft hosts
The hosts in the following tables are owned by Microsoft, and provide services required for the proper functioning of your workspace. The tables list hosts for the Azure public, Azure Government, and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet regions.
Important
Azure Machine Learning uses Azure Storage Accounts in your subscription and in Microsoft-managed subscriptions. Where applicable, the following terms are used to differentiate between them in this section:
Your storage: The Azure Storage Account(s) in your subscription, which is used to store your data and artifacts such as models, training data, training logs, and Python scripts.>
Microsoft storage: The Azure Machine Learning compute instance and compute clusters rely on Azure Batch, and must access storage located in a Microsoft subscription. This storage is used only for the management of the compute instances. None of your data is stored here.

Docker images maintained by Azure Machine Learning
Tip
Azure Container Registryis required for any custom Docker image. This includes small modifications (such as additional packages) to base images provided by Microsoft. It is also required by the internal training job submission process of Azure Machine Learning. Furthermore,Microsoft Container Registryis always needed regardless of the scenario.
