Required FQDNs and endpoints for Azure Virtual Desktop

In order to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop and for your users to connect, you must allow specific FQDNs and endpoints. Users also need to be able to connect to certain FQDNs and endpoints to access their Azure Virtual Desktop resources. This article lists the required FQDNs and endpoints you need to allow for your session hosts and users.
These FQDNs and endpoints could be blocked if you're using a firewall, such asAzure Firewall, or proxy service. For guidance on using a proxy service with Azure Virtual Desktop, seeProxy service guidelines for Azure Virtual Desktop.
You can check that your session host VMs can connect to these FQDNs and endpoints by following the steps to run theAzure Virtual Desktop Agent URL ToolinCheck access to required FQDNs and endpoints for Azure Virtual Desktop. The Azure Virtual Desktop Agent URL Tool validates each FQDN and endpoint and show whether your session hosts can access them.
Important
Microsoft doesn't support Azure Virtual Desktop deployments where the FQDNs and endpoints listed in this article are blocked.

This article doesn't include FQDNs and endpoints for other services such as Microsoft Entra ID, Office 365, custom DNS providers or time services. Microsoft Entra FQDNs and endpoints can be found under ID56,59and125inOffice 365 URLs and IP address ranges.

Service tags and FQDN tags
Service tagsrepresent groups of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change, minimizing the complexity of frequent updates to network security rules. Service tags can be used in rules forNetwork Security Groups(NSGs) andAzure Firewallto restrict outbound network access. Service tags can be also used inUser Defined Routes(UDRs) to customize traffic routing behavior.
Azure Firewall also supportsFQDN tags, which represent a group of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) associated with well known Azure and other Microsoft services. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't have a list of IP address ranges that you can unblock instead of FQDNs to allow network traffic. If you're using a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), you need to use a dynamic list made for Azure IP addresses to make sure you can connect. For more information, seeUse Azure Firewall to protect Azure Virtual Desktop deployments.
Azure Virtual Desktop has both a service tag and FQDN tag entry available. We recommend you use service tags and FQDN tags to simplify your Azure network configuration.
Session host virtual machines
The following table is the list of FQDNs and endpoints your session host VMs need to access for Azure Virtual Desktop. All entries are outbound; you don't need to open inbound ports for Azure Virtual Desktop. Select the relevant tab based on which cloud you're using.

Tip
You must use the wildcard character (*) for FQDNs involvingservice traffic.
Foragent traffic, if you prefer not to use a wildcard, here's how to find specific FQDNs to allow:
Ensure your session hosts are registered to a host pool.
On a session host, openEvent viewer, then go toWindows logs>Application>WVD-Agentand look for event ID3701.
Unblock the FQDNs that you find under event ID 3701. The FQDNs under event ID 3701 are region-specific. You need to repeat this process with the relevant FQDNs for each Azure region you want to deploy your session hosts in.
End user devices
Any device on which you use one of theRemote Desktop clientsto connect to Azure Virtual Desktop must have access to the following FQDNs and endpoints. Allowing these FQDNs and endpoints is essential for a reliable client experience. Blocking access to these FQDNs and endpoints isn't supported and affects service functionality.
