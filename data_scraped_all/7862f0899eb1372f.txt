As ofAugust 31, 2024, Azure classic administrator roles (along with Azure classic resources and Azure Service Manager) are retired and no longer supported. Starting onApril 30, 2025, any Co-Administrator or Service Administrator role assignments will lose access. If you still have active Co-Administrator or Service Administrator role assignments, convert these role assignments to Azure RBAC immediately.
Microsoft recommends that you manage access to Azure resources using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). If you're still using the classic deployment model, you'll need to migrate your resources from classic deployment to Resource Manager deployment. For more information, seeAzure Resource Manager vs. classic deployment.
This article describes the retirement of the Co-Administrator and Service Administrator roles and how to convert these role assignments.

Co-Administrator and Service Administrator role assignments will lose access. If you don't have an Owner role assignment at subscription scope, you will lose access to manage the subscription.
How do I know what subscriptions have classic administrators?
You can use an Azure Resource Graph query to list subscriptions with Service Administrator or Co-Administrator role assignments. For steps seeList classic administrators.
What is the equivalent Azure role I should assign for Co-Administrators?
Ownerrole at subscription scope has the equivalent access. However, Owner is aprivileged administrator roleand grants full access to manage Azure resources. You should consider a job function role with fewer permissions, reduce the scope, or add a condition.
What is the equivalent Azure role I should assign for Service Administrator?
Ownerrole at subscription scope has the equivalent access.
Why do I need to migrate to Azure RBAC?
Azure RBAC offers fine grained access control, compatibility with Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and full audit logs support. All future investments will be in Azure RBAC.
What about the Account Administrator role?
The Account Administrator is the primary user for your billing account. Account Administrator isn't being deprecated and you don't need to convert this role assignment. Account Administrator and Service Administrator might be the same user. However, you only need to convert the Service Administrator role assignment.
What should I do if I lose access to a subscription?
If you remove your classic administrators without having at least one Owner role assignment for a subscription, you will lose access to the subscription and the subscription will be orphaned. To regain access to a subscription, you can do the following:Follow steps toelevate access to manage all subscriptions in a tenant.Assign the Owner role at subscription scope for a user.Remove elevated access.
