Azure Resource Health keeps you informed about the current and historical health status of your Azure resources. These alerts can notify you when these resources have a change in their health status. Creating Resource Health alerts allows users to create and customize alerts in bulk.
Resource health notifications are stored in theAzure activity log. Given the possibly large volume of information stored in the activity log, there is a separate user interface to make it easier to view and set up alerts on resource health notifications.

The subscription affected.
The resource types affected.
The resource groups affected.
The resources affected.
The event statuses of the resources affected.
