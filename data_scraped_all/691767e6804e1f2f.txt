Tip
You can use Azure Machine Learningmanaged virtual networksinstead of the steps in this article. With a managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning handles the job of network isolation for your workspace and managed computes. You can also add private endpoints for resources needed by the workspace, such as Azure Storage Account. For more information, seeWorkspace managed network isolation.
In this article, you learn how to secure an Azure Machine Learning workspace and its associated resources in an Azure Virtual Network.
This article is part of a series on securing an Azure Machine Learning workflow. See the other articles in this series:

An existing virtual network and subnet to use with your compute resources.WarningDo not use the 172.17.0.0/16 IP address range for your VNet. This is the default subnet range used by the Docker bridge network, and will result in errors if used for your VNet. Other ranges may also conflict depending on what you want to connect to the virtual network. For example, if you plan to connect your on premises network to the VNet, and your on-premises network also uses the 172.16.0.0/16 range. Ultimately, it is up toyouto plan your network infrastructure.

Limitations
Azure storage account
If you plan to use Azure Machine Learning studio and the storage account is also in the virtual network, there are extra validation requirements:If the storage account uses aservice endpoint, the workspace private endpoint and storage service endpoint must be in the same subnet of the virtual network.If the storage account uses aprivate endpoint, the workspace private endpoint and storage private endpoint must be in the same virtual network. In this case, they can be in different subnets.

If the storage account uses aprivate endpoint, the workspace private endpoint and storage private endpoint must be in the same virtual network. In this case, they can be in different subnets.
Azure Container Instances
When your Azure Machine Learning workspace is configured with a private endpoint, deploying to Azure Container Instances in a virtual network isn't supported. Instead, consider using aManaged online endpoint with network isolation.
Azure Container Registry
When your Azure Machine Learning workspace or any resource is configured with a private endpoint it may be required to setup a user managed compute cluster for AzureML Environment image builds. Default scenario is leveragingserverless computeand currently intended for scenarios with no network restrictions on resources associated with AzureML Workspace.
Important
The compute cluster used to build Docker images needs to be able to access the package repositories that are used to train and deploy your models. You might need to add network security rules that allow access to public repos,use private Python packages, or usecustom Docker images (SDK v1)that already include the packages.
Azure Monitor
Warning
Azure Monitor supports using Azure Private Link to connect to a VNet. However, you must use the open Private Link mode in Azure Monitor. For more information, seePrivate Link access modes: Private only vs. Open.
Required public internet access
Azure Machine Learning requires both inbound and outbound access to the public internet. The following tables provide an overview of the required access and what purpose it serves. For service tags that end in.region, replaceregionwith the Azure region that contains your workspace. For example,Storage.westus:
.region
region
Storage.westus
Tip
The required tab lists the required inbound and outbound configuration. The situational tab lists optional inbound and outbound configurations required by specific configurations you might want to enable.

Tip
If you need the IP addresses instead of service tags, use one of the following options:
Download a list fromAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags.
Use the Azure CLIaz network list-service-tagscommand.
Use the Azure PowerShellGet-AzNetworkServiceTagcommand.
The IP addresses may change periodically.
You may also need to allowoutboundtraffic to Visual Studio Code and non-Microsoft sites for the installation of packages required by your machine learning project. The following table lists commonly used repositories for machine learning:
anaconda.com
*.anaconda.com
*.anaconda.org
pypi.org

vscode.blob.core.windows.net
*.gallerycdn.vsassets.io
raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-tools-for-ai/master/azureml_remote_websocket_server/*
Note
When using theAzure Machine Learning VS Code extensionthe remote compute instance will require an access to public repositories to install the packages required by the extension. If the compute instance requires a proxy to access these public repositories or the Internet, you will need to set and export theHTTP_PROXYandHTTPS_PROXYenvironment variables in the~/.bashrcfile of the compute instance. This process can be automated at provisioning time by using acustom script.
HTTP_PROXY
HTTPS_PROXY
~/.bashrc
When using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure Machine Learning, allow the following traffic to the AKS VNet:
General inbound/outbound requirements for AKS as described in theRestrict egress traffic in Azure Kubernetes Servicearticle.
Outboundto mcr.microsoft.com.
When deploying a model to an AKS cluster, use the guidance in theDeploy ML models to Azure Kubernetes Servicearticle.
For information on using a firewall solution, seeConfigure required input and output communication.
Secure the workspace with private endpoint
Azure Private Link lets you connect to your workspace using a private endpoint. The private endpoint is a set of private IP addresses within your virtual network. You can then limit access to your workspace to only occur over the private IP addresses. A private endpoint helps reduce the risk of data exfiltration.
For more information on configuring a private endpoint for your workspace, seeHow to configure a private endpoint.
Warning
Securing a workspace with private endpoints does not ensure end-to-end security by itself. You must follow the steps in the rest of this article, and the VNet series, to secure individual components of your solution. For example, if you use a private endpoint for the workspace, but your Azure Storage Account is not behind the VNet, traffic between the workspace and storage does not use the VNet for security.
Secure Azure storage accounts
Azure Machine Learning supports storage accounts configured to use either a private endpoint or service endpoint.

Secure Azure Key Vault
Azure Machine Learning uses an associated Key Vault instance to store the following credentials:
The associated storage account connection string
Passwords to Azure Container Repository instances
Connection strings to data stores
Azure key vault can be configured to use either a private endpoint or service endpoint. To use Azure Machine Learning experimentation capabilities with Azure Key Vault behind a virtual network, use the following steps:

Enable Azure Container Registry (ACR)
Tip
If you did not use an existing Azure Container Registry when creating the workspace, one may not exist. By default, the workspace will not create an ACR instance until it needs one. To force the creation of one, train or deploy a model using your workspace before using the steps in this section.
Azure Container Registry can be configured to use a private endpoint. Use the following steps to configure your workspace to use ACR when it is in the virtual network:

Securely connect to your workspace
To connect to a workspace that's secured behind a VNet, use one of the following methods:
Azure VPN gateway- Connects on-premises networks to the VNet over a private connection. Connection is made over the public internet. There are two types of VPN gateways that you might use:Point-to-site: Each client computer uses a VPN client to connect to the VNet.Site-to-site: A VPN device connects the VNet to your on-premises network.

Point-to-site: Each client computer uses a VPN client to connect to the VNet.
Site-to-site: A VPN device connects the VNet to your on-premises network.
ExpressRoute- Connects on-premises networks into the cloud over a private connection. Connection is made using a connectivity provider.
ExpressRoute- Connects on-premises networks into the cloud over a private connection. Connection is made using a connectivity provider.
Azure Bastion- In this scenario, you create an Azure Virtual Machine (sometimes called a jump box) inside the VNet. You then connect to the VM using Azure Bastion. Bastion allows you to connect to the VM using either an RDP or SSH session from your local web browser. You then use the jump box as your development environment. Since it is inside the VNet, it can directly access the workspace. For an example of using a jump box, seeTutorial: Create a secure workspace.

Important
When using aVPN gatewayorExpressRoute, you will need to plan how name resolution works between your on-premises resources and those in the VNet. For more information, seeUse a custom DNS server.
If you have problems connecting to the workspace, seeTroubleshoot secure workspace connectivity.
Workspace diagnostics
You can run diagnostics on your workspace from Azure Machine Learning studio or the Python SDK. After diagnostics run, a list of any detected problems is returned. This list includes links to possible solutions. For more information, seeHow to use workspace diagnostics.
Public access to workspace
Important
While this is a supported configuration for Azure Machine Learning, Microsoft doesn't recommend it. You should verify this configuration with your security team before using it in production.
In some cases, you might need to allow access to the workspace from the public network (without connecting through the virtual network using the methods detailed theSecurely connect to your workspacesection). Access over the public internet is secured using TLS.
To enable public network access to the workspace, use the following steps:
Enable public accessto the workspace after configuring the workspace's private endpoint.
Configure the Azure Storage firewallto allow communication with the IP address of clients that connect over the public internet. You might need to change the allowed IP address if the clients don't have a static IP. For example, if one of your Data Scientists is working from home and can't establish a VPN connection to the virtual network.
