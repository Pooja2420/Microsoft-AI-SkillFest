Important
Starting with Azure DevOps Server 2019, you don't have to pay for self-hosted concurrent jobs in releases. You're only limited by the number of agents that you have.
Learn how to estimate how many parallel jobs you need and buy more parallel jobs for your organization.
Note
The free grant of parallel jobs for public projects and for certain private projects in new organizations is temporarily disabled. However, you can request this grant by submittinga request. Existing organizations and projects aren't affected. It can take several business days to process your free tier requests. During certain time periods, processing times might be longer.
Prerequisites
What is a parallel job?
When you define a pipeline, you can define it as a collection ofjobs. When a pipeline runs, you can run multiple jobs as part of that pipeline. Each running job consumes aparallel jobthat runs on an agent. When there aren't enough parallel jobs available for your organization, the jobs are queued up and run one after the other.
In Azure Pipelines, you can run parallel jobs on Microsoft-hosted infrastructure or your own (self-hosted) infrastructure. Each parallel job allows you to run a single job at a time in your organization. You don't need to pay for parallel jobs if you're using an on-premises server. The concept of parallel jobs only applies to Azure DevOps Services.
Microsoft-hosted vs. self-hosted parallel jobs
If you want to run your jobs on machines that Microsoft manages, useMicrosoft-hosted parallel jobs. Your jobs run onMicrosoft-hosted agents.
If you want Azure Pipelines to orchestrate your builds and releases, but use your own machines to run them, useself-hosted parallel jobs. For self-hosted parallel jobs, you start by deploying ourself-hosted agentson your machines. You can register any number of these self-hosted agents in your organization.
How much do parallel jobs cost?
We provide afree tierof service by default in every organization for both hosted and self-hosted parallel jobs.
Parallel jobs are purchased at the organization level, and shared by all projects in an organization.
Microsoft-hosted
Self-hosted
For Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs, you can get up to 10 free Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs that can run for up to 360 minutes (6 hours) each time forpublic projects. When you create a new Azure DevOps organization, you aren't given this free grant by default.
Forprivate projects, you can get one free job that can run for up to 60 minutes each time. When you create a new Azure DevOps organization, you might not always be given this free grant by default.
To request the free grant for public or private projects, submita request.
Note
It can take several business days to process your free tier request. During certain time periods, processing times might be longer.
There's no time limit on parallel jobs for public projects and a 30 hour time limit per month for private projects.
When the free tier is no longer sufficient, you can pay for more capacity per parallel job. For pricing cost per parallel job, see theAzure DevOps pricing page. Paid parallel jobs remove the monthly time limit and allow you to run each job for up to 360 minutes (6 hours).
Buy Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs.
New organizations have a maximum limit of 25 parallel jobs for Microsoft-hosted agents.Contact supportto request a limit increase. Limit increases are subject to capacity in your organization's region.
When you purchase your first Microsoft-hosted parallel job, the number of parallel jobs you have in the organization is still one. To be able to run two jobs concurrently, you need to purchase two parallel jobs if you're currently on the free tier. The first purchase only removes the time limits on the first job.
Tip
If your pipeline exceeds the maximum job timeout, try splitting your pipeline
into multiple jobs. For more information on jobs, seeSpecify jobs in your pipeline.
For self-hosted parallel jobs, you can register any number ofself-hosted agentsin your organization. We charge based on the number of jobs you want to run at a time, not the number of agents registered. There are no time limits on self-hosted jobs.
For public projects that are self-hosted, you can have unlimited parallel jobs running. For private projects, you can have one job plus one job for each active Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber who is a member of your organization.
When the free tier is no longer sufficient for your self-hosted private project, you can purchase more capacity per parallel job. For pricing cost per parallel job, see theAzure DevOps pricing page.
Buy self-hosted parallel jobs.
How many parallel jobs do I need?
As the number of queued builds and releases exceeds the number of parallel jobs you have, your build and release queues grow longer. When you find the queue delays are too long, you can purchase more parallel jobs as needed. There are several methods you can use to check your parallel job limits and job history.
View job history using the pool consumption report
You can use thePool consumption report, available on theAnalyticstab of your agent pool, to see a chart of running and queued jobs graphed with your parallel jobs for the previous 30 days. If you have a backlog of queued jobs and your running jobs are at the concurrency limit, you might want to purchase more parallel jobs. For more information, seePool consumption report.

Check the parallel jobs setting directly
Figure out how many parallel jobs you need by first seeing how many parallel jobs your organization currently uses:
Browse toOrganization settings>Pipelines>Parallel jobs.URL example:https://{Your_Organization}/_admin/_buildQueue?_a=resourceLimits
Browse toOrganization settings>Pipelines>Parallel jobs.

Estimate costs
A simple rule of thumb: Estimate that you need one parallel job for every four to five users in your organization.
In the following scenarios, you might need multiple parallel jobs:
If you have multiple teams, and if each of them require CI, you might need a parallel job for each team.
If your CI trigger applies to multiple branches, you might need a parallel job for each active branch.
If you develop multiple applications by using one organization or server, you might need more parallel jobs: one to deploy each application at the same time.
How do I buy more parallel jobs?
To buy more parallel jobs:
Billing must be set up for your organization
You need to be a member of theProject Collection Administratorsgroup.

How is a parallel job consumed in DevOps Services?
Consider an organization that has only one Microsoft-hosted parallel job. This job allows users in that organization to collectively run only one job at a time. When more jobs are triggered, they're queued until previous jobs finish.
If you use release or YAML pipelines, then a run consumes a parallel job only when it's being actively deployed to a stage. While the release is waiting for an approval or a manual intervention, it doesn't consume a parallel job.
When you run aserver jobor deploy to adeployment groupusing release pipelines, you don't consume any parallel jobs.

FabrikamFiber CI Build 102 (main branch) starts first.
Deployment of FabrikamFiber Release 11 gets triggered by completion of FabrikamFiber CI Build 102.
FabrikamFiber CI Build 101 (feature branch) is triggered. The build can't start yet because Release 11's deployment is active. So the build stays queued.
Release 11 waits for approvals. Fabrikam CI Build 101 starts because a release that's waiting for approvals doesn't consume a parallel job.
Release 11 is approved. It resumes only after Fabrikam CI Build 101 is completed.
FAQ
How do I qualify for the free tier of public projects?
You qualify for the free tier limits for public projects if you meet both of these conditions:
Your pipeline is part of an Azure Pipelinespublic project.
Your pipeline builds a public repository from GitHub or from the same public project in your Azure DevOps organization.
For information on how to apply for the grant of free parallel jobs, seeHow much do parallel jobs cost (Microsoft-hosted)?
Can I assign a parallel job to a specific project or agent pool?
Currently, there isn't a way to partition or dedicate parallel job capacity to a specific project or agent pool. For example:
You purchase two parallel jobs in your organization.
You start two runs in the first project, and both the parallel jobs are consumed.
You start a run in the second project. That run doesn't start until one of the runs in your first project is completed.
Are there limits on who can use Azure Pipelines?
You can have as many users as you want when you're using Azure Pipelines. There's no per-user charge for using Azure Pipelines. Users with bothbasic and stakeholder accesscan author as many builds and releases as they want.
Are there any limits on the number of builds and release pipelines that I can create?
No. You can create hundreds or even thousands of pipelines for no charge. You can register any number of self-hosted agents for no charge.
What about the option to pay for hosted agents by the minute?
Some of our earlier customers are still on a per-minute plan for the hosted agents. In this plan, you pay $0.05/minute for the first 20 hours after the free tier, and $0.01/minute after 20 hours. Because of the following limitations in this plan, you might want to consider moving to the parallel jobs model:
When you're using the per-minute plan, you can run only one job at a time.
When you run builds for more than 14 paid hours in a month, the per-minute plan might be less cost-effective than the parallel jobs model.
I use XAML build controllers with my organization. How am I charged for them?
You can register one XAML build controller for each self-hosted parallel job in your organization.
Your organization gets at least one free self-hosted parallel job, so you can register one XAML build controller for no extra charge.
For each additional XAML build controller, you need an additional self-hosted parallel job.
