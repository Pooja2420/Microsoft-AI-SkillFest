Cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetesprovide an Azure Resource Manager-based experience to install and manage lifecycles for different Azure capabilities in your cluster. You candeploy extensions to your clustersto support different scenarios and to improve cluster management.
The following extensions are currently available to use with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. With one exception, all the extensions that are described in this article arecluster-scoped. Azure API Management on Azure Arc is namespace-scoped.
Container insights in Azure Monitor
Supported distributions: All Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)-certified Kubernetes clusters.
The Container insights feature in Azure Monitor gives you a view into the performance of workloads that are deployed on your Kubernetes cluster. Use this extension to collect memory and CPU utilization metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.
For more information, seeContainer insights for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.
Azure Policy
Azure Policy extendsGatekeeper, an admission controller webhook forOpen Policy Agent(OPA). Use Gatekeeper with OPA to consistently apply centralized, at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters.
For more information, seeUnderstand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters.
Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider
Supported distributions: AKS on Azure Local, AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Cluster API Azure, Google Kubernetes Engine, Canonical Kubernetes Distribution, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.
Use the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver to integrate an instance of Azure Key Vault as a secrets store with a Kubernetes cluster via a CSI volume. For Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, you can install the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets.
For more information, seeUse the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets into Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.
Secret Store
Supported distributions: All CNCF-certified Kubernetes clusters that are connected to Azure Arc and running Kubernetes 1.27 or later.
The Azure Key Vault Secret Store extension for Kubernetes (Secret Store) automatically syncs secrets from an instance of Azure Key Vault to a Kubernetes cluster for offline access. You can use Azure Key Vault to store, maintain, and rotate your secrets, even when you run your Kubernetes cluster in a semi-disconnected state.
We recommend the Secret Store extension for scenarios that require offline access, or if you need secrets synced to the Kubernetes secret store. If you don't need to use these features, we recommend that you instead use the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension.
For more information, seeUse the Secret Store extension to fetch secrets for offline access in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.
Important
Secret Store is currently in preview.

Microsoft Defender for Containers
Supported distributions: AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Cluster API Azure, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift (version 4.6 or later), Google Kubernetes Engine Standard, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, Rancher Kubernetes Engine, and Canonical Kubernetes Distribution.
Microsoft Defender for Containers is the cloud-native solution that is used to secure your containers so you can improve, monitor, and maintain the security of your clusters, containers, and their applications. Microsoft Defender for Containers gathers information related to security, such as audit log data, from the Kubernetes cluster. Then, it provides recommendations and threat alerts based on the gathered data.
For more information, seeEnable Microsoft Defender for Containers.
Important
Defender for Containers support for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters is currently in public preview.
See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Azure Arc-enabled Open Service Mesh
Supported distributions: AKS, AKS on Azure Local,  AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Cluster API Azure, Google Kubernetes Engine, Canonical Kubernetes Distribution, Rancher Kubernetes Engine, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Azure API Management on Azure Arc
Supported distributions: All CNCF-certified Kubernetes clusters.
With the integration between Azure API Management and Azure Arc on Kubernetes, you can deploy the API Management gateway component as an extension in an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. This extension isnamespace-scoped, not cluster-scoped.
For more information, seeDeploy an Azure API Management gateway on Azure Arc (preview).

Flux (GitOps)
Supported distributions: All CNCF-certified Kubernetes clusters.
GitOps on AKS and Azure Arc-enabled KubernetesusesFlux v2, a popular open-source tool set, to help manage cluster configuration and application deployment. GitOps is enabled in the cluster as aMicrosoft.KubernetesConfiguration/extensions/microsoft.fluxcluster extension resource.
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/extensions/microsoft.flux
For more information, seeTutorial: Deploy applications using GitOps with Flux v2.
The most recent version of the Flux v2 extension and the two previous versions (N-2) are supported. We generally recommend that you use the most recent version of the extension.
Note
When a new version of themicrosoft.fluxextension is released, it might take several days for the new version to become available in all regions.

Breaking change: Semantic versioning changes in source controller
Thesource-controllerrecently updated its dependency on the "github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3" Go package from version v3.3.0 to v3.3.1. This update changed semantic versioning (semver) validation rules.
source-controller
github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3
What changed?In the latest version (v3.3.1) of the semver package, certain version formats that were previously considered valid are now being rejected. Specifically, version strings with leading zeroes in numeric segments (e.g., 1.0.029903) are no longer accepted as valid semver.
GitHub Issue for reference:Previously supported chart version numbers are now invalid â fluxcd/source-controller #17380
Package change log:Comparing v3.3.0...v3.3.1 Â· Masterminds/semver

Impact on users:
Existing deployments are unaffected. Anything currently deployed will continue to function as expected.
Future deployments or reconciliations may failif they rely on chart versions that donât follow the stricter semver rules.
A common error you might see:invalid chart reference: validation: chart.metadata.version "1.0.029903" is invalid
invalid chart reference: validation: chart.metadata.version "1.0.029903" is invalid
What you should do:Review your chart versions and ensure they comply with proper semantic versioning. Avoid leading zeroes in version components, and follow thesemver.orgspecification closely.
