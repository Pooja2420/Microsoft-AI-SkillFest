App Service
Your App Service plan has no apps running. Consider deleting the resource to save costs.

We've analyzed the usage patterns of your app service plan over the past 7 days and identified low CPU usage. While certain scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by choosing a less expensive SKU while retaining the same features.
Potential benefits: Optimize your cost

Application Gateway
We recommend having at least two origins for resiliency. However, if only a single origin is available, Azure Front Door will continue to route traffic to it regardless of the health probe status. In such cases, health probes don't influence Front Door's routing behavior and offer no benefits.
Potential benefits: Save on bandwidth costs by disabling health probes
Impact:Low

Your Front Door Classic tier contains a large number of domains or routing rules, which adds extra charges. Front Door Standard or Premium doesn't charge per additional domain or routing rule. Consider migrating to save costs.
Potential benefits: Save costs

Azure Cosmos DB
Based on your usage in the past 7 days, you can save by enabling autoscale. For each hour, we compared the RU/s provisioned to the actual utilization of the RU/s (what autoscale would have scaled to) and calculated the cost savings across the time period. Autoscale helps optimize your cost by scaling down RU/s when not in use.
Potential benefits: Optimize Azure spend
Impact:Medium

ResourceType: microsoft.documentdb/databaseaccountsRecommendation ID: cdf51428-a41b-4735-ba23-39f3b7cde20c
Your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account is currently containing resources with a total provisioned throughput exceeding 1000 Request Units per second (RU/s). Because Azure Cosmos DB's free tier only covers the first 1000 RU/s of throughput provisioned across your account, any throughput beyond 1000 RU/s is billed at the regular pricing. As a result, we anticipate that you are charged for the throughput currently provisioned on your Azure Cosmos DB account.
Potential benefits: Confirm your expected Azure Cosmos DB costs
Impact:Medium

Migrate your database account to a new database account to take advantage of Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB v4.2. Upgrading to v4.20 can reduce your storage costs by up to 55% and your query costs by up to 45% by leveraging a new storage format. Numerous other features such as multi-document transactions are also included in v4.2. When upgrading, you must also migrate the data in your existing account to a new account created using version 4.2. Azure Data Factory or Studio 3T can assist you in migrating your data.
Potential benefits: Improved reliability, query/storage efficiency, performance, and new feature capabilities

Looks like your resource could have automatically scaled to reduce costs (based on your actual usage during the last week, cache utilization, ingestion utilization, CPU, and streaming ingests utilization). To optimize costs and performance, we recommend enabling Optimized Autoscale. You are encouraged to choose the recommended minimum and maximum instance count that we have provided.

Over time, internal extents merge operations can accumulate redundant and unused storage artifacts that remain beyond the data retention period. While this unreferenced data doesn't negatively impact the performance, it can lead to more storage use and larger costs than necessary. This recommendation surfaces Data Explorer resources that have unused storage artifacts. The recommended action is to run the cleanup command to detect and delete unused storage artifacts and reduce cost. Note that data recoverability will be reset to the cleanup time and will not be available on data that was created before running the cleanup.
Potential benefits: Optimize cost

Based on your actual usage during the last month, update the cache policy to reduce the hot cache for the table. With autoscale enabled, the cluster can potentially scale in and thus reduce costs. Our goal is that more than 95% of the queries read data from the hot cache (*) The analysis is based only on user queries that scanned data.

Azure Database for MariaDB
Our internal telemetry shows that the MariaDB database server resources have been underutilized for an extended period of time over the last 7 days. Low resource utilization results in unwanted expenditure which can be fixed without significant performance impact. To reduce your costs and efficiently manage your resources, we recommend reducing the compute size (vCores) by half.

Apache Spark for Azure Synapse Analytics pool's Autoscale feature automatically scales the number of nodes in a cluster instance up and down. During the creation of a new Apache Spark for Azure Synapse Analytics pool, a minimum and maximum number of nodes can be set when Autoscale is selected. Autoscale then monitors the resource requirements of the load and scales the number of nodes up or down. There's no extra charge for this feature.
Potential benefits: The Autoscale feature monitors resource requirements and automatically scales the number of nodes up and down to meet the compute and memory requirements, thereby optimizing costs from unused resources.

We analyzed your compute usage over the last 30 days and recommend adding a savings plan to increase your savings. The savings plan unlocks lower prices on select compute services when you commit to spend a fixed hourly amount for 1 or 3 years. As you use select compute services globally, your usage is covered by the plan at reduced prices. During the times when your usage is above your hourly commitment, you'll simply be billed at your regular pay-as-you-go prices. With savings automatically applying across compute usage globally, you'll continue saving even as your usage needs change over time. Savings plan are more suited for dynamic workloads while accommodating for planned or unplanned changes while reservations are more suited for stable, predictable workloads with no planned changes. Saving estimates are calculated for individual subscriptions and the usage pattern observed over last 30 days. Shared scope savings plans are available in purchase experience and can further increase savings.
