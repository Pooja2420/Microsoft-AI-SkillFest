This guide teaches you to migrate your Oracle schemas to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines by using SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle.
For other migration guides, seeDatabase Migration.
Prerequisites
To migrate your Oracle schema to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, you need:
A supported source environment.
SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle.
A targetSQL Server VM.
Thenecessary permissions for SSMA for Oracleand theprovider.
Connectivity and sufficient permissions to access the source and the target.
Pre-migration
To prepare to migrate to the cloud, verify that your source environment is supported and that you've addressed any prerequisites. Doing so will help to ensure an efficient and successful migration.
This part of the process involves:
Conducting an inventory of the databases that you need to migrate.
Assessing those databases for potential migration problems or blockers.
Resolving any problems that you uncover.
Discover
UseMAP Toolkitto identify existing data sources and details about the features your business is using. Doing so will give you a better understanding of the migration and help you plan for it. This process involves scanning the network to identify your organization's Oracle instances and the versions and features you're using.
To use MAP Toolkit to do an inventory scan, follow these steps:
OpenMAP Toolkit.

Assess
After you identify the data sources, useSQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracleto assess the Oracle instances migrating to the SQL Server VM. The assistant will help you understand the gaps between the source and destination databases. You can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Server, and then migrate data to SQL Server.
To create an assessment, follow these steps:
OpenSQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle.

Review the HTML report for conversion statistics, errors, and warnings. Analyze it to understand conversion problems and resolutions.You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Oracle objects and the effort required to complete schema conversions. The default location for the report is the report folder inSSMAProjects.For example:drive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyOracleMigration\report\report_2016_11_12T02_47_55\

Migrate
After you have the necessary prerequisites in place and have completed the tasks associated with the pre-migration stage, you're ready to start the schema and data migration. Migration involves two steps: publishing the schema and migrating the data.
To publish your schema and migrate the data, follow these steps:
Publish the schema: right-click the database inSQL Server Metadata Explorerand selectSynchronize with Database. Doing so publishes the Oracle schema to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.Review the mapping between your source project and your target:

To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expandTables, and then select the checkboxes next to the tables. To omit data from individual tables, clear the checkboxes.

Instead of using SSMA, you could use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to migrate the data. To learn more, see:
The articleSQL Server Integration Services.
The white paperSSIS for Azure and Hybrid Data Movement.
Post-migration
After you complete the migration stage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is running as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
Remediate applications
After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that previously consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Making those changes might require changes to the applications.
Perform tests
To test your database migration, complete these activities:
Develop validation tests. To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. Create the validation queries to run against both the source and target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope that you've defined.

Optimize
The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy problems and verifying completeness. It's also critical for addressing performance issues with the workload.
Note
For more information about these problems and specific steps to mitigate them, see thePost-migration validation and optimization guide.
