To monitor the guest operating system and workloads on an Azure virtual machine, installAzure Monitor Agentand create adata collection rule (DCR)that specifies which data to collect. VM insights installs the agent and collection performance data, but you need to create more DCRs to collect log data such as Windows event logs and Syslog. VM insights also doesn't send guest performance data to Azure Monitor Metrics where it can be analyzed with metrics explorer and used with metrics alerts.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a DCR that sends guest performance data to Azure Monitor Metrics and log events to Azure Monitor Logs.
View guest logs in Log Analytics.
View guest metrics in metrics explorer.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure virtual machine to monitor.
Important
This tutorial doesn't require VM insights to be enabled for the virtual machine. Azure Monitor Agent is installed on the VM if it isn't already installed.
Create a data collection rule
Data collection rulesin Azure Monitor define data to collect and where it should be sent. When you define the DCR by using the Azure portal, you specify the virtual machines it should be applied to. Azure Monitor Agent is automatically installed on any virtual machines that don't already have it.
Note
You must currently install Azure Monitor Agent from theMonitormenu in the Azure portal. This functionality isn't yet available from the virtual machine's menu.
On theMonitormenu in the Azure portal, selectData Collection Rules. Then selectCreateto create a new DCR.

On theBasicstab, enter aRule Name, which is the name of the rule displayed in the Azure portal. Select aSubscription,Resource Group, andRegionwhere the DCR and its associations are stored. These resources don't need to be the same as the resources being monitored. ThePlatform Typedefines the options that are available as you define the rest of the DCR. SelectWindowsorLinuxif the rule is associated only with those resources or selectCustomif it's associated with both types.

Select resources
On theResourcestab, identify one or more virtual machines to which the DCR applies. Azure Monitor Agent is installed on any VMs that don't already have it. SelectAdd resourcesand select either your virtual machines or the resource group or subscription where your virtual machine is located. The DCR applies to all virtual machines in the selected scope.

Select data sources
A single DCR can have multiple data sources. For this tutorial, we use the same rule to collect both guest metrics and guest logs. We send metrics to Azure Monitor Metrics and to Azure Monitor Logs so that they can both be analyzed with metrics explorer and Log Analytics.
On theCollect and delivertab, selectAdd data source. For theData source type, selectPerformance counters. Leave theBasicsetting and select the counters that you want to collect. UseCustomto select individual metric values.

Select theDestinationtab.Azure Monitor Metricsshould already be listed. SelectAdd destinationto add another. SelectAzure Monitor LogsforDestination type. Select your Log Analytics workspace forAccount or namespace. SelectAdd data sourceto save the data source.

SelectAdd data sourceagain to add logs to the DCR. For theData source type, selectWindows event logsorLinux syslog. Select the types of log data that you want to collect.


Select theDestinationtab.Azure Monitor Logsshould already be selected forDestination type. Select your Log Analytics workspace forAccount or namespace. If you don't already have a workspace, you can select the default workspace for your subscription, which is automatically created. SelectAdd data sourceto save the data source.

SelectReview + createto create the DCR and install the Azure Monitor agent on the selected virtual machines.

View logs
Data is retrieved from a Log Analytics workspace by using a log query written in Kusto Query Language. Although a set of precreated queries are available for virtual machines, we use a simple query to have a look at the events that we're collecting.
SelectLogsfrom your virtual machine's menu. Log Analytics opens with an empty query window with the scope set to that machine. Any queries include only records collected from that machine.
Note
TheQuerieswindow might open when you open Log Analytics. It includes precreated queries that you can use. For now, close this window because we're going to manually create a simple query.

In the empty query window, enter eitherEventorSyslogdepending on whether your machine is running Windows or Linux. Then selectRun. The events collected within theTime rangeare displayed.
Note
If the query doesn't return any data, you might need to wait a few minutes until events are created on the virtual machine to be collected. You might also need to modify the data source in the DCR to include other categories of events.

View guest metrics
You can view metrics for your host virtual machine with metrics explorer without a DCR likeany other Azure resource. With the DCR, you can use metrics explorer to view guest metrics and host metrics.
SelectMetricsfrom your virtual machine's menu. Metrics explorer opens with the scope set to your virtual machine. SelectMetric Namespace>Virtual Machine Guest.
Note
If you don't seeVirtual Machine Guest, you might need to wait a few minutes for the agent to deploy and data to begin collecting.

The available guest metrics are displayed. Select a metric to add to the chart.

Now that you're collecting guest metrics for the virtual machine, you can create metric alerts based on guest metrics such as logical disk space.
