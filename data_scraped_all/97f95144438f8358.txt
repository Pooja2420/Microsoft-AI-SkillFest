After initial deployment of the Azure Connected Machine agent, you may need to reconfigure the agent, upgrade it, or remove it from the computer. These routine maintenance tasks can be done manually or through automation (which reduces both operational error and expenses). This article describes the operational aspects of the agent. See theazcmagent CLI documentationfor command line reference information.
Installing a specific version of the agent
Microsoft recommends using the most recent version of the Azure Connected Machine agent for the best experience. However, if you need to run an older version of the agent for any reason, you can follow these instructions to install a specific version of the agent.
Windows
Linux - apt
Linux - yum
Linux - zypper
Links to the current and previous releases of the Windows agents are available below the heading of eachrelease note. If you're looking for an agent version that's more than six months old, check out therelease notes archive.

Upgrade the agent
The Azure Connected Machine agent is updated regularly to address bug fixes, stability enhancements, and new functionality.Azure Advisoridentifies resources that aren't using the latest version of the machine agent and recommends that you upgrade to the latest version. It notifies you when you select the Azure Arc-enabled server by presenting a banner on theOverviewpage or when you access Advisor through the Azure portal.
The Azure Connected Machine agent for Windows and Linux can be upgraded to the latest release manually or automatically depending on your requirements. Installing, upgrading, or uninstalling the Azure Connected Machine Agent doesn't require you to restart your server.
The following table describes the methods supported to perform the agent upgrade:
Windows agent
The latest version of the Azure Connected Machine agent for Windows-based machines can be obtained from:
Microsoft Update
Microsoft Update
Microsoft Update Catalog
Microsoft Update Catalog
Microsoft Download Center
Microsoft Download Center
The recommended way of keeping the Windows agent up to date is to automatically obtain the latest version through Microsoft Update. This allows you to utilize your existing update infrastructure (such as Microsoft Configuration Manager or Windows Server Update Services) and include Azure Connected Machine agent updates with your regular OS update schedule.
Windows Server doesn't check for updates in Microsoft Update by default. To receive automatic updates for the Azure Connected Machine Agent, you must configure the Windows Update client on the machine to check for other Microsoft products.
For Windows Servers that belong to a workgroup and connect to the Internet to check for updates, you can enable Microsoft Update by running the following commands in PowerShell as an administrator:
$ServiceManager = (New-Object -com "Microsoft.Update.ServiceManager")
$ServiceID = "7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d"
$ServiceManager.AddService2($ServiceId,7,"")
$ServiceManager = (New-Object -com "Microsoft.Update.ServiceManager")
$ServiceID = "7971f918-a847-4430-9279-4a52d1efe18d"
$ServiceManager.AddService2($ServiceId,7,"")
For Windows Servers that belong to a domain and connect to the Internet to check for updates, you can configure this setting at-scale using Group Policy:
Sign into a computer used for server administration with an account that can manage Group Policy Objects (GPO) for your organization.

The next time computers in your selected scope refresh their policy, they'll start to check for updates in both Windows Update and Microsoft Update.
For organizations that use Microsoft Configuration Manager (MECM) or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to deliver updates to their servers, you need to configure WSUS to synchronize the Azure Connected Machine Agent packages and approve them for installation on your servers. Follow the guidance forWindows Server Update ServicesorMECMto add the following products and classifications to your configuration:
Product Name: Azure Connected Machine Agent (select all sub-options)
Classifications: Critical Updates, Updates
Once the updates are being synchronized, you can optionally add the Azure Connected Machine Agent product to your auto-approval rules so your servers automatically stay up to date with the latest agent software.

Automatic agent upgrades
The Azure Connected Machine agent doesn't automatically upgrade itself when a new version is released. You should include the latest version of the agent with your scheduled patch cycles.
Renaming an Azure Arc-enabled server resource
When you change the name of a Linux or Windows machine connected to Azure Arc-enabled servers, the new name isn't recognized automatically because the resource name in Azure is immutable. As with other Azure resources, you must delete the resource and re-create it in order to use the new name.
For Azure Arc-enabled servers, before you rename the machine, it's necessary to remove the VM extensions before proceeding:
Audit the VM extensions installed on the machine and note their configuration using theAzure CLIorAzure PowerShell.

Use theazcmagenttool with theDisconnectparameter to disconnect the machine from Azure Arc and delete the machine resource from Azure. You can run this manually while logged on interactively, with a Microsoft identityaccess token, or with the service principal you used for onboarding (or with anew service principal that you create.Disconnecting the machine from Azure Arc-enabled servers doesn't remove the Connected Machine agent, and you don't need to remove the agent as part of this process.

Disconnecting the machine from Azure Arc-enabled servers doesn't remove the Connected Machine agent, and you don't need to remove the agent as part of this process.
Re-register the Connected Machine agent with Azure Arc-enabled servers. Run theazcmagenttool with theConnectparameter to complete this step. The agent will default to using the computer's current hostname, but you can choose your own resource name by passing the--resource-nameparameter to the connect command.

Uninstall the agent
For servers you no longer want to manage with Azure Arc-enabled servers, follow the steps below to remove any VM extensions from the server, disconnect the agent, and uninstall the software from your server. It's important to complete all of these steps to fully remove all related software components from your system.
Step 1: Remove VM extensions
If you have deployed Azure VM extensions to an Azure Arc-enabled server, you must uninstall the extensions before disconnecting the agent or uninstalling the software. Uninstalling the Azure Connected Machine agent doesn't automatically remove extensions, and these extensions won't be recognized if you reconnect the server to Azure Arc.
For guidance on how to identify and remove any extensions on your Azure Arc-enabled server, see the following resources:
Manage VM extensions with the Azure portal
Manage VM extensions with Azure PowerShell
Manage VM extensions with Azure CLI
Step 2: Disconnect the server from Azure Arc
Disconnecting the agent deletes the corresponding Azure resource for the server and clears the local state of the agent. To disconnect the agent, run theazcmagent disconnectcommand as an administrator on the server. You'll be prompted to sign in with an Azure account that has permission to delete the resource in your subscription. If the resource has already been deleted in Azure, pass an additional flag to clean up the local state:azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only.
azcmagent disconnect
azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only
If your Administrator and Azure accounts are different, you may encounter issues with the sign-in prompt defaulting to the Admininstrator account. To resolve this, execute theazcmagent disconnect --use-device-codecommand. You'll be prompted to sign in with an Azure account that has permission to delete the resource in your subscription.
azcmagent disconnect --use-device-code
Caution
When disconnecting the agent from Arc-enabled VMs running on Azure Local, use only theazcmagent disconnect --force-local-onlycommand. Using the command without theâforce-local-onlyflag can cause your Arc VM on Azure Local to be deleted both from Azure and on-premises.
azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only
âforce-local-only
Step 3: Uninstall the Windows agent (if applicable)
Both of the following methods remove the agent, but they don't remove theC:\Program Files\AzureConnectedMachineAgentfolder on the machine.
Follow these steps to uninstall the Windows agent from the machine:
Sign in to the computer with an account that has administrator permissions.
Sign in to the computer with an account that has administrator permissions.
InControl panel, selectPrograms and Features.
InControl panel, selectPrograms and Features.
InPrograms and Features, selectAzure Connected Machine Agent, selectUninstall, and then selectYes.
InPrograms and Features, selectAzure Connected Machine Agent, selectUninstall, and then selectYes.
You can also delete the Windows agent directly from the agent setup wizard. Run theAzureConnectedMachineAgent.msiinstaller package to do so.
You can uninstall the agent manually from the Command Prompt or by using an automated method (such as a script) by following the example below. First you need to retrieve the product code, which is a GUID that is the principal identifier of the application package, from the operating system. The uninstall is performed by using the Msiexec.exe command line -msiexec /x {Product Code}.
msiexec /x {Product Code}
Open the Registry Editor.
Open the Registry Editor.
Under registry keyHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall, look for and copy the product code GUID.

Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq "Azure Connected Machine Agent"} | `
ForEach-Object {MsiExec.exe /x "$($_.PsChildName)" /qn}
Step 4: Uninstall the Linux agent (if applicable)
Note
To uninstall the agent, you must haverootaccess permissions or an account that has elevated rights using sudo.
The command used to uninstall the Linux agent depends on the Linux operating system.
For Ubuntu, run the following command:sudo apt purge azcmagent
For Ubuntu, run the following command:
sudo apt purge azcmagent

For SLES, run the following command:sudo zypper remove azcmagent
For SLES, run the following command:
sudo zypper remove azcmagent
sudo zypper remove azcmagent
Update or remove proxy settings
To configure the agent to communicate to the service through a proxy server or to remove this configuration after deployment, use one of the methods described below. Note that the agent communicates outbound using the HTTP protocol under this scenario.
As of agent version 1.13, proxy settings can be configured using theazcmagent configcommand or system environment variables. If a proxy server is specified in both the agent configuration and system environment variables, the agent configuration will take precedence and become the effective setting. Useazcmagent showto view the effective proxy configuration for the agent.
azcmagent config
azcmagent show
Note
Azure Arc-enabled servers doesn't support usingLog Analytics gatewayas a proxy for the Connected Machine agent.
Agent-specific proxy configuration
Agent-specific proxy configuration is available starting with version 1.13 of the Azure Connected Machine agent and is the preferred way of configuring proxy server settings. This approach prevents the proxy settings for the Azure Connected Machine agent from interfering with other applications on your system.
Note
Extensions deployed by Azure Arc will not inherit the agent-specific proxy configuration.
Refer to the documentation for the extensions you deploy for guidance on how to configure proxy settings for each extension.
To configure the agent to communicate through a proxy server, run the following command:
azcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
azcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
You can use an IP address or simple hostname in place of the FQDN if your network requires it. If your proxy server runs on port 80, you may omit ":80" at the end.
To check if a proxy server URL is configured in the agent settings, run the following command:
azcmagent config get proxy.url
azcmagent config get proxy.url
To stop the agent from communicating through a proxy server, run the following command:
azcmagent config clear proxy.url
azcmagent config clear proxy.url
You do not need to restart any services when reconfiguring the proxy settings with theazcmagent configcommand.
azcmagent config
Proxy bypass for private endpoints
Starting with agent version 1.15, you can also specify services which shouldnotuse the specified proxy server. This can help with split-network designs and private endpoint scenarios where you want Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Resource Manager traffic to go through your proxy server to public endpoints but want Azure Arc traffic to skip the proxy and communicate with a private IP address on your network.
The proxy bypass feature doesn't require you to enter specific URLs to bypass. Instead, you provide the name of the service(s) that shouldn't use the proxy server. The location parameter refers to the Azure region of the Arc Server(s).
Proxy bypass value when set toArcDataonly bypasses the traffic of the Azure extension for SQL Server and not the Arc agent.

ArcData
To send Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Resource Manager traffic through a proxy server but skip the proxy for Azure Arc traffic, run the following command:
azcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
azcmagent config set proxy.bypass "Arc"
azcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
azcmagent config set proxy.bypass "Arc"
To provide a list of services, separate the service names by commas:
azcmagent config set proxy.bypass "ARM,Arc"
azcmagent config set proxy.bypass "ARM,Arc"
To clear the proxy bypass, run the following command:
azcmagent config clear proxy.bypass
azcmagent config clear proxy.bypass
You can view the effective proxy server and proxy bypass configuration by runningazcmagent show.
azcmagent show
Windows environment variables
On Windows, the Azure Connected Machine agent will first check theproxy.urlagent configuration property (starting with agent version 1.13), then the system-wideHTTPS_PROXYenvironment variable to determine which proxy server to use. If both are empty, no proxy server is used, even if the default Windows system-wide proxy setting is configured.
proxy.url
HTTPS_PROXY
Microsoft recommends using the agent-specific proxy configuration instead of the system environment variable.
To set the proxy server environment variable, run the following commands:
# If a proxy server is needed, execute these commands with the proxy URL and port.
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port", "Machine")
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "Machine")
# For the changes to take effect, the agent services need to be restarted after the proxy environment variable is set.
Restart-Service -Name himds, ExtensionService, GCArcService
# If a proxy server is needed, execute these commands with the proxy URL and port.
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port", "Machine")
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "Machine")
# For the changes to take effect, the agent services need to be restarted after the proxy environment variable is set.
Restart-Service -Name himds, ExtensionService, GCArcService
To configure the agent to stop communicating through a proxy server, run the following commands:
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", $null, "Machine")
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "Machine")
# For the changes to take effect, the agent services need to be restarted after the proxy environment variable removed.
Restart-Service -Name himds, ExtensionService, GCArcService
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", $null, "Machine")
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "Machine")
# For the changes to take effect, the agent services need to be restarted after the proxy environment variable removed.
Restart-Service -Name himds, ExtensionService, GCArcService
Linux environment variables
On Linux, the Azure Connected Machine agent first checks theproxy.urlagent configuration property (starting with agent version 1.13), and then theHTTPS_PROXYenvironment variable set for the himds, GC_Ext, and GCArcService daemons. There's an included script that will configure systemd's default proxy settings for the Azure Connected Machine agent and all other services on the machine to use a specified proxy server.
proxy.url
HTTPS_PROXY
To configure the agent to communicate through a proxy server, run the following command:
sudo /opt/azcmagent/bin/azcmagent_proxy add "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
sudo /opt/azcmagent/bin/azcmagent_proxy add "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
To remove the environment variable, run the following command:
sudo /opt/azcmagent/bin/azcmagent_proxy remove
sudo /opt/azcmagent/bin/azcmagent_proxy remove
Migrating from environment variables to agent-specific proxy configuration
If you're already using environment variables to configure the proxy server for the Azure Connected Machine agent and want to migrate to the agent-specific proxy configuration based on local agent settings, follow these steps:
Upgrade the Azure Connected Machine agentto the latest version (starting with version 1.13) to use the new proxy configuration settings.
Upgrade the Azure Connected Machine agentto the latest version (starting with version 1.13) to use the new proxy configuration settings.
Configure the agent with your proxy server information by runningazcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port".
Configure the agent with your proxy server information by runningazcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port".
azcmagent config set proxy.url "http://ProxyServerFQDN:port"
Remove the unused environment variables by following the steps forWindowsorLinux.
Remove the unused environment variables by following the steps forWindowsorLinux.
Alerting for Azure Arc-enabled server disconnection
The Connected Machine agentsends a regular heartbeat messageto the service every five minutes. If an Arc-enabled server stops sending heartbeats to Azure for longer than 15 minutes, it can mean that it's offline, the network connection has been blocked, or the agent isn't running. Develop a plan for how youâll respond and investigate these incidents, including setting  upResource Health alertsto get notified when such incidents occur.
