This article explains how to enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage (classic) on your subscriptions using various templates such as PowerShell, REST API, and others.
Note
Defender for Storage (classic) is unavailable for new subscriptions as of February 5, 2025.
You can alsoupgrade to the new Microsoft Defender for Storage planand use advanced security capabilities, including malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection. Benefit from a predictable and granular pricing structure that charges per storage account, with extra costs for high-volume transactions. This new pricing plan also encompasses all new security features and detections.
Note
If you use Defender for Storage (classic) with per-transaction or per-storage account pricing, you need to migrate to the new Defender for Storage plan to access these features and pricing. Learn aboutmigrating to the new Defender for Storage plan.
Microsoft Defender for Storageis an Azure-native security intelligence layer that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It uses advanced threat detection capabilities andâ¯Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligenceâ¯data to provide contextual security alerts. These alerts include steps to mitigate detected threats and prevent future attacks.
Microsoft Defender for Storage continuously analyzes transactions ofAzure Blob Storage,Azure Data Lake Storage, andAzure Filesservices. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts generate. Microsoft Defender for Cloud shows alerts with details of suspicious activity, appropriate investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations.
Analyzed telemetry of Azure Blob Storage includes operation types like Get Blob, Put Blob, Get Container ACL, List Blobs, and Get Blob Properties. Examples of analyzed Azure Files operation types include Get File, Create File, List Files, Get File Properties, and Put Range.
Defender for Storage classic doesnât access Storage account data and has no impact on its performance.
Learn more about thebenefits, features, and limitations of Defender for Storage. You can also learn more about Defender for Storage in theDefender for Storage episodeof the Defender for Cloud in the Field video series.

Exclude a storage account from a protected subscription in the per-transaction plan
When a subscription hasMicrosoft Defender for Storageenabled, all current and future Azure Storage accounts in that subscription are protected. You can exclude specific storage accounts from Defender for Storage protections using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.
We recommend that you enable Defender for Storage on the entire subscription to protect all existing and future storage accounts in it. However, there are some cases where people want to exclude specific storage accounts from Defender protection.
Exclusion of storage accounts from protected subscriptions requires you to:
Add a tag to block inheriting the subscription enablement.
Disable Defender for Storage (classic).
Note
Consider upgrading to the new Defender for Storage plan if you have storage accounts you would like to exclude from the Defender for Storage classic plan. Not only will you save on costs for transaction-heavy accounts, but you'll also gain access to enhanced security features. Learn more about thebenefits of migrating to the new plan.
Excluded storage accounts in the Defender for Storage classic are not automatically excluded when you migrate to the new plan.
