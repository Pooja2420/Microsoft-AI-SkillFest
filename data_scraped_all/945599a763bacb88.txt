Architecture

The diagram shows how to modernize mainframe and midrange systems by migrating data to Azure. A dotted line divides the diagram in two halves. The left half is labeled on-premises, and the right half is labeled Azure. In the on-premises half, a data store box contains file systems, like VSAM flat files, relational databases, like Db2 zOS, and nonrelational databases, like IMS. A dotted arrow points from the data store box to another box labeled object conversion. This box contains converters like SQL Server Migration Assistant for Db2. A dotted arrow connects the object conversion box to a data storage box on the Azure side of the diagram. It represents how object definitions are converted into corresponding objects in target data stores like Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Lake Storage. Arrows from the file systems and relational databases connect to Azure self-hosted integration runtime and on-premises data gateway show how data is ingested and transformed. The arrows continue to a box that contains File Transfer Protocol and another box that contains SQL Server, Azure Data Factory, and Microsoft Fabric. An arrow connects the nonrelational databases to partner integration solutions. An arrow connects the data ingestion and transformation box with the data storage box. Finally, arrows from the data storage box connect to Azure services and client apps.

Scenario details
Modern data storage solutions like the Azure data platform provide better scalability and performance than mainframe and midrange systems. By modernizing your systems, you can take advantage of these benefits. However, updating technology, infrastructure, and practices is complex. The process involves an exhaustive investigation of business and engineering activities. Data management is one consideration when you modernize your systems. You also need to look at data visualization and integration.
Successful modernizations use adata-first strategy. When you use this approach, you focus on the data rather than the new system. Data management is no longer just an item on the modernization checklist. Instead, the data is the centerpiece. Coordinated, quality-oriented data solutions replace fragmented, poorly governed ones.
This solution uses Azure data platform components in a data-first approach. Specifically, the solution involves:
Object conversion.Convert object definitions from the source data store to corresponding objects in the target data store.
