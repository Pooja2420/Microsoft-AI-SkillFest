Microsoft Entra ID provides single-sign on and enhanced application access security for Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft Online services for hybrid and cloud-only implementations without requiring any third-party solution. Microsoft 365, like most of Microsoftâs Online services, is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID for directory services, authentication, and authorization. Microsoft Entra ID also provides single sign-on to thousands of SaaS applications and on-premises web applications. See the Microsoft Entra IDapplication galleryfor supported SaaS applications.
IDP Validation
If your organization uses a third-party federation solution, you can configure single sign-on for your on-premises Active Directory users with Microsoft Online services, such as Microsoft 365, provided the third-party federation solution is compatible with Microsoft Entra ID. For questions regarding compatibility, contact your identity provider.  If you want to see a list of identity providers who have previously been tested for compatibility with Microsoft Entra ID, by Microsoft, seeMicrosoft Entra identity provider compatibility docs.
Note
Microsoft no longer provides validation testing to independent identity providers for compatibility with Microsoft Entra ID. If you want to test your product for interoperability please refer to theseguidelines.
