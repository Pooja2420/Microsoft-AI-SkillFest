MQ
Reference

The MQ connector provides an API to work with IBM MQ server.
This article describes the operations for the IBM MQbuilt-inconnector, which is availableonlyfor Standard workflows in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. If you're looking for the MQmanagedconnector operations instead, seeMQ managed connector reference.
Built-in connector settings
In a Standard logic app resource, the application and host settings control various thresholds for performance, throughput, timeout, and so on. For more information, seeEdit host and app settings for Standard logic app workflows.
