Azure Monitor Logs tables
This section lists the Azure Monitor Logs tables relevant to this service, which are available for query by Log Analytics using Kusto queries. The tables contain resource log data and possibly more depending on what is collected and routed to them.
Azure Notification Hubs supports operational logs, which capture management operations that are performed on the Notification Hubs namespace. All logs are stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format in the following two locations:
AzureActivity: Displays logs from operations and actions that are conducted against the namespace in the Azure portal or through Azure Resource Manager template deployments.
AzureDiagnostics: Displays logs from operations and actions that are conducted against the namespace by using the API, or through management clients on the language SDK.
Diagnostic log JSON strings include the elements listed in the following table:
OperationalLogs
Succeeded
Failed
Activity log
The linked table lists the operations that can be recorded in the activity log for this service. These operations are a subset ofall the possible resource provider operations in the activity log.
For more information on the schema of activity log entries, seeActivity Log schema.
Operational logs capture all management operations that are performed on the Azure Notification Hubs namespace. Data operations aren't captured, because of the high volume of data operations that are conducted on notification hubs.
Microsoft.NotificationHubs resource provider operationslists all the management operations that are captured in operational logs.
