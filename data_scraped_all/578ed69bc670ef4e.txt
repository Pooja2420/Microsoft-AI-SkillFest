In this article, you learn how to assign a system-assigned or a user-assigned identity to an Event Grid system topic. To learn about managed identities in general, seeWhat are managed identities for Azure resources.
Note
You can assign one system-assigned identity and up to two user-assigned identities to a system topic.
You can enable identities for system topics associated with global Azure resources such as Azure subscriptions, resource groups, or Azure Maps. System topics for these global sources are also not associated with a specific region.

Currently, you can't enable a managed identity for a new system topic when creating an event subscription on an Azure resource that supports system topics.
Next steps
Add the identity to an appropriate role (for example, Service Bus Data Sender) on the destination (for example, a Service Bus queue). For detailed steps, seeGrant managed identity the access to Event Grid destination.
