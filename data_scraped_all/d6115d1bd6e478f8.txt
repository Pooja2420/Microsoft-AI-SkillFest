Level 1 - initial
Tip
Score fromGenAIOps Maturity Model Assessment: initial (0-9).
Description:Your organization is at the initial foundational stage of GenAIOps maturity. You're exploring the capabilities of LLMs but haven't yet developed structured practices or systematic approaches.
Begin by familiarizing yourself with different LLM APIs and their capabilities. Next, start experimenting with structured prompt design and basic prompt engineering. ReviewMicrosoft Learningarticles as a starting point. Taking what youâve learned, discover how to introduce basic metrics for LLM application performance evaluation.
