Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal with a certificate

When you have an app or script that needs to access resources, you can set up an identity for the app and authenticate the app with its own credentials. This identity is known as a service principal. This approach enables you to:
Assign permissions to the app identity that are different than your own permissions. Typically, these permissions are restricted to exactly what the app needs to do.
Use a certificate for authentication when executing an unattended script.
Important
Instead of creating a service principal, consider using managed identities for Azure resources for your application identity. If your code runs on a service that supports managed identities and accesses resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication, managed identities are a better option for you. To learn more about managed identities for Azure resources, including which services currently support it, seeWhat is managed identities for Azure resources?.
This article shows you how to create a service principal that authenticates with a certificate. To set up a service principal with password, seeCreate an Azure service principal with Azure PowerShell.
You must have thelatest versionof PowerShell for this article.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. SeeInstall Azure PowerShellto get started. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Required permissions
To complete this article, you must have sufficient permissions in both your Microsoft Entra ID and Azure subscription. Specifically, you must be able to create an app in Microsoft Entra ID, and assign the service principal to a role.
The easiest way to check whether your account has adequate permissions is through the Microsoft Entra admin center.
Assign the application to a role
To access resources in your subscription, you must assign the application to a role. Decide which role offers the right permissions for the application. To learn about the available roles, seeAzure built-in roles.
You can set the scope at the level of the subscription, resource group, or resource. Permissions are inherited to lower levels of scope. For example, adding an application to theReaderrole for a resource group means it can read the resource group and any resources it contains. To allow the application to execute actions like reboot, start and stop instances, select theContributorrole.
Create service principal with self-signed certificate
The following example covers a simple scenario. It usesNew-âAzADâServiceâPrincipalto create a service principal with a self-signed certificate, and usesNew-AzRoleAssignmentto assign theReaderrole to the service principal. The role assignment is scoped to your currently selected Azure subscription. To select a different subscription, useSet-AzContext.
Note
The New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet and the PKI module are currently not supported in PowerShell Core.
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
  -Subject "CN=exampleappScriptCert" `
  -KeySpec KeyExchange
$keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())

$sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName exampleapp `
  -CertValue $keyValue `
  -EndDate $cert.NotAfter `
  -StartDate $cert.NotBefore
Sleep 20
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $sp.AppId
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
  -Subject "CN=exampleappScriptCert" `
  -KeySpec KeyExchange
$keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())

$sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName exampleapp `
  -CertValue $keyValue `
  -EndDate $cert.NotAfter `
  -StartDate $cert.NotBefore
Sleep 20
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $sp.AppId
The example sleeps for 20 seconds to allow some time for the new service principal to propagate throughout Microsoft Entra ID. If your script doesn't wait long enough, you'll see an error stating: "Principal {ID} doesn't exist in the directory {DIR-ID}." To resolve this error, wait a moment then run theNew-AzRoleAssignmentcommand again.
You can scope the role assignment to a specific resource group by using theResourceGroupNameparameter. You can scope to a specific resource by also using theResourceTypeandResourceNameparameters.
If youdo not have Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016, download theNew-SelfSignedCertificateEx cmdletfrom PKI Solutions. Extract its contents and import the cmdlet you need.
# Only run if you could not use New-SelfSignedCertificate
Import-Module -Name c:\ExtractedModule\New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1
# Only run if you could not use New-SelfSignedCertificate
Import-Module -Name c:\ExtractedModule\New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1
In the script, substitute the following two lines to generate the certificate.
New-SelfSignedCertificateEx -StoreLocation CurrentUser `
  -Subject "CN=exampleapp" `
  -KeySpec "Exchange" `
  -FriendlyName "exampleapp"
$cert = Get-ChildItem -path Cert:\CurrentUser\my | where {$PSitem.Subject -eq 'CN=exampleapp' }
New-SelfSignedCertificateEx -StoreLocation CurrentUser `
  -Subject "CN=exampleapp" `
  -KeySpec "Exchange" `
  -FriendlyName "exampleapp"
$cert = Get-ChildItem -path Cert:\CurrentUser\my | where {$PSitem.Subject -eq 'CN=exampleapp' }
Provide certificate through automated PowerShell script
Whenever you sign in as a service principal, provide the tenant ID of the directory for your AD app. A tenant is an instance of Microsoft Entra ID.
$TenantId = (Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId
$ApplicationId = (Get-AzADApplication -DisplayNameStartWith exampleapp).AppId

$Thumbprint = (Get-ChildItem cert:\CurrentUser\My\ | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq "CN=exampleappScriptCert" }).Thumbprint
Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal `
  -CertificateThumbprint $Thumbprint `
  -ApplicationId $ApplicationId `
  -TenantId $TenantId
$TenantId = (Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId
$ApplicationId = (Get-AzADApplication -DisplayNameStartWith exampleapp).AppId

$Thumbprint = (Get-ChildItem cert:\CurrentUser\My\ | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq "CN=exampleappScriptCert" }).Thumbprint
Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal `
  -CertificateThumbprint $Thumbprint `
  -ApplicationId $ApplicationId `
  -TenantId $TenantId
Create service principal with certificate from Certificate Authority
The following example uses a certificate issued from a Certificate Authority to create service principal. The assignment is scoped to the specified Azure subscription. It adds the service principal to theReaderrole. If an error occurs during the role assignment, it retries the assignment.

Provide certificate through automated PowerShell script
Whenever you sign in as a service principal, provide the tenant ID of the directory for your AD app. A tenant is an instance of Microsoft Entra ID.

 Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal `
  -CertificateThumbprint $Thumbprint `
  -ApplicationId $ApplicationId `
  -TenantId $TenantId
The application ID and tenant ID aren't sensitive, so you can embed them directly in your script. If you need to retrieve the tenant ID, use:
(Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId
(Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId
If you need to retrieve the application ID, use:
(Get-AzADApplication -DisplayNameStartWith {display-name}).AppId
(Get-AzADApplication -DisplayNameStartWith {display-name}).AppId
Change credentials
To change the credentials for an AD app, either because of a security compromise or a credential expiration, use theRemove-AzADAppCredentialandNew-AzADAppCredentialcmdlets.
To remove all the credentials for an application, use:
Get-AzADApplication -DisplayName exampleapp | Remove-AzADAppCredential
Get-AzADApplication -DisplayName exampleapp | Remove-AzADAppCredential
To add a certificate value, create a self-signed certificate as shown in this article. Then, use:
Get-AzADApplication -DisplayName exampleapp | New-AzADAppCredential `
  -CertValue $keyValue `
  -EndDate $cert.NotAfter `
  -StartDate $cert.NotBefore
Get-AzADApplication -DisplayName exampleapp | New-AzADAppCredential `
  -CertValue $keyValue `
  -EndDate $cert.NotAfter `
  -StartDate $cert.NotBefore
Debug
You may get the following errors when creating a service principal:
"Authentication_Unauthorized"or"No subscription found in the context."- You see this error when your account doesn't have therequired permissionson the Microsoft Entra ID to register an app. Typically, you see this error when only admin users in your Microsoft Entra ID can register apps, and your account isn't an admin. Ask your administrator to either assign you to an administrator role, or to enable users to register apps.
