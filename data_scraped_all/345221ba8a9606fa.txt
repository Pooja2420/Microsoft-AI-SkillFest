Analytics is the reporting platform for Azure DevOps, replacing the previous platform based on SQL Server Reporting Services. Built for reporting, Analytics is optimized for fast read-access and server-based aggregations. Use it to answer quantitative questions about the past or present state of your projects.

Dashboard widgets
You can createdashboardsandadd widgets to them. We provide severalwidgets based on Analytics. These widgets take advantage of the power of Analytics. Widgets provide the easiest way to get insights from your data.
For example, the Velocity widget shown in the following image provides insights into a team's historical performance over six iterations.

Here, the Velocity widget shows that this team has a history of closing stories late. It also shows a discrepancy between planned and completed work across all the sprints displayed. The team can drill into the data to determine the root causes. After implementing new practices, the team can use the Velocity widget to track their effectiveness.
Check outAdd an Analytics widget to a dashboardfor a step-by-step guide to get started with the Velocity widget.
