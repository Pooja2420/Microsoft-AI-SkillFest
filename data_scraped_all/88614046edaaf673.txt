View work items that you created or are assigned to you. TheWork itemspage offers several personalized pivots and interactive filter functions to streamline listing work items. Use this page to quickly find work items defined across teams within a project.
This article shows how to add any type of work item. However, use the backlog or board to add backlog or portfolio itemsâsuch as user stories, product backlog items, features, or epics. For more information, seeCreate your backlog,Define features and epics, andStart using your board.
To create test cases and link them to user stories, seeAdd, run, and update inline testsandCreate test plans and test suites.
You can add work items in the following ways:
Add work items from the Work items page
Add work items from a Boards, Backlogs, or Sprints page
Add work items using the Azure DevOps CLI
These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and track your work items within Azure DevOps.
Note
TheWork Itemspage is available from Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions, and Visual Studio 2019 RC1.
Prerequisites

ProvideStakeholder accessto members who want to contribute to the discussion and review progress. These are typically members who don't contribute to code, but want to view work items, backlogs, boards, and dashboards.
By default, allContributorsandStakeholdersin public projects can add new and existing tags. In private projects, Stakeholders can only add existing tags. To control the ability to create new tags, set theCreate tag definitionpermission at the project level. For more information, seeChange project-level permissions.

Open the Work items page
Web portal
Visual Studio 2019
Azure DevOps CLI
From your project, selectBoards>Work items.

Open Visual Studio 2019, Team Explorer, and then selectWork Items. To switch between theWork Items(default) view and the legacy view, seeSet the Work Items experience in Visual Studio 2019.
Note
TheWork Itemspage is only supported when connected to an Azure Repos Git or TFVC repository. When you connect to a GitHub or other Git repository, theWork ItemsandBuildspages don't appear.

If you don't see theWork Itemsoption, you're not connected to a project. From the Connect to a Project dialog. UseCTRL-Shiftto select your options and then chooseConnect.

There's noaz boardscommand that opens theWork Itemspage at this time. The Azure DevOps CLI commands are valid for Azure DevOps Services only.
Note
The types of work items you can create depend on the process chosen when the project was createdâAgile,Basic,Scrum, orCMMI. For example, backlog items may be called user stories (Agile), issues (Basic), product backlog items (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). All these types describe the customer value to deliver and the work to be performed.
For more information, seeAbout processes and process templates.
