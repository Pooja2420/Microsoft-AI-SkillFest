After connecting your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, use theOverviewpage to view, monitor, and analyze activities across your environment. This article describes the widgets and graphs available on Microsoft Sentinel'sOverviewdashboard.
Important
Microsoft Sentinel is generally available within Microsoft's unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal.
Prerequisites
Make sure that you have reader access to Microsoft Sentinel resources. For more information, seeRoles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel.
Access the Overview page
If your workspace is onboarded to the Microsoft Defender portal, selectGeneral > Overview. Otherwise, selectOverviewdirectly. For example:

Data for each section of the dashboard is precalculated, and the last refresh time is shown at the top of each section. SelectRefreshat the top of the page to refresh the entire page.
View incident data
To help reduce noise and minimize the number of alerts you need to review and investigate, Microsoft Sentinel uses a fusion technique to correlate alerts intoincidents. Incidents are actionable groups of related alerts for you to investigate and resolve.
The following image shows an example of theIncidentssection on theOverviewdashboard:

TheIncidentssection lists the following data:
The number of new, active, and closed incidents over the last 24 hours.
The total number of incidents of each severity.
The number of closed incidents of each type of closing classification.
Incident statuses by creation time, in four hour intervals.
The mean time to acknowledge an incident and the mean time to close an incident, with a link to the SOC efficiency workbook.
SelectManage incidentsto jump to the Microsoft SentinelIncidentspage for more details.
View automation data
After deploying automation with Microsoft Sentinel, monitor your workspace's automation in theAutomationsection of theOverviewdashboard.

Start with a summary of the automation rules activity: Incidents closed by automation, the time the automation saved, and related playbooks health.Microsoft Sentinel calculates the time saved by automation by finding the average time that a single automation saved, multiplied by the number of incidents resolved by automation. The formula is as follows:(avgWithout - avgWith) * resolvedByAutomationWhere:avgWithoutis the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved without automation.avgWithis the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved by automation.resolvedByAutomationis the number of incidents that are resolved by automation.

(avgWithout - avgWith) * resolvedByAutomation
(avgWithout - avgWith) * resolvedByAutomation
Where:
avgWithoutis the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved without automation.
avgWithis the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved by automation.
resolvedByAutomationis the number of incidents that are resolved by automation.
Below the summary, a graph summarizes the numbers of actions performed by automation, by type of action.

View status of data records, data collectors, and threat intelligence
In theDatasection of theOverviewdashboard, track information on data records, data collectors, and threat intelligence.

View the following details:
The number of records that Microsoft Sentinel collected in the last 24 hours, compared to the previous 24 hours, and anomalies detected in that time period.
