Azure automatically routes traffic between Azure subnets, virtual networks, and on-premises networks. If you want to change Azure's default routing, you do so by creating a route table. If you're new to routing in virtual networks, you can learn more about it invirtual network traffic routingor by completing atutorial.

If you don't have one, set up an Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Then complete one of these tasks before starting steps in any section of

PowerShell users: Either run the commands in theAzure Cloud Shell, or run PowerShell
from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that
you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools
preinstalled and configured to use with your account. In the Azure Cloud
Shell browser tab, find theSelect environmentdropdown list, then
choosePowerShellif it isn't already selected.If you're running PowerShell locally, use Azure PowerShell module version
1.0.0 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Az.Networkto find the
installed version. If you need to upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module.
Also runConnect-AzAccountto create a connection with Azure.

Associate a route table to a subnet
You can optionally associate a route table to a subnet. A route table can be associated to zero or more subnets. Route tables aren't associated to virtual networks. You must associate a route table to each subnet you want the route table associated to.
Azure routes all traffic leaving the subnet based on routes created:
Within route tables

You can only associate a route table to subnets in virtual networks that exist in the same Azure location and subscription as the route table.

The prefix can't be duplicated in more than one route within the route table, though the prefix can be within another prefix. For example, if you defined10.0.0.0/16as a prefix in one route, you can still define another route with the10.0.0.0/22address prefix. Azure selects a route for traffic based on longest prefix match.

View effective routes
The effective routes for each VM-attached network interface are a combination of route tables created, Azure's default routes, and any routes propagated from on-premises networks via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) through an Azure virtual network gateway. Understanding the effective routes for a network interface is helpful when troubleshooting routing problems. You can view the effective routes for any network interface attached to a running virtual machine.

Validate routing between two endpoints
You can determine the next hop type between a virtual machine and the IP address of another Azure resource, an on-premises resource, or a resource on the Internet. Determining Azure's routing is helpful when troubleshooting routing problems. To complete this task, you must have an existing network watcher. If you don't have an existing network watcher, create one by completing the steps inCreate a Network Watcher instance.
