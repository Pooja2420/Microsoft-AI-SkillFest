When merging a GitHub pull request using AB#{Id}, only the Fixes keyword is supported to close the linked work item. However, as a user, I would like the ability to set the linked work item to a specific state, such asResolved, without necessarily closing it. Ideally, I should be able to select any state supported by the work item type during the merge process.
