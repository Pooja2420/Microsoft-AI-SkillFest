In this article
Diagnostic settings in Azure are used to collect resource logs. An Azure resource emits resource logs and provides rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. These logs are captured per request and are also referred to as "data plane logs". Seediagnostic settings in Azure Monitorfor a recommended overview of the functionality in Azure. The content of these logs varies by resource type. In Azure Cache for Redis, two options are available to log:
Cache Metrics(that is "AllMetrics") used tolog metrics from Azure Monitor
Connection Logslogs connections to the cache for security and diagnostic purposes.
Scope of availability
Cache Metrics
Azure Cache for Redis emitsmany metricssuch asServer LoadandConnections per Secondthat are useful to log. Selecting theAllMetricsoption allows these and other cache metrics to be logged. You can configure how long the metrics are retained. Seehere for an example of exporting cache metrics to a storage account.
Connection Logs
Azure Cache for Redis uses Azure diagnostic settings to log information on client connections to your cache. Logging and analyzing this diagnostic setting helps you understand who is connecting to your caches and the timestamp of those connections. The log data could be used to identify the scope of a security breach and for security auditing purposes.
Differences Between Azure Cache for Redis Tiers
Implementation of connection logs is slightly different between tiers:
Basic, Standard, and Premium-tier cachespolls client connections by IP address, including the number of connections originating from each unique IP address. These logs aren't cumulative. They represent point-in-time snapshots taken at 10-second intervals. Authentication events (successful and failed) and disconnection events aren't logged in these tiers.

They represent point-in-time snapshots taken at 10-second intervals. Authentication events (successful and failed) and disconnection events aren't logged in these tiers.

The connection logs produced look similar among the tiers, but have some differences. The two formats are shown in more detail later in the article.
Important
The connection logging in the Basic, Standard, and Premium tierspollsthe current client connections in the cache. The same client IP addresses appears over and over again. Logging in the Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers is focused on each connectionevent. Logs only occur when the actual event occurred for the first time.
Prerequisites/Limitations of Connection Logging
Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers
Because connection logs in these tiers consist of point-in-time snapshots taken every 10 seconds, connections that are established and removed in-between 10-second intervals aren't logged.
Authentication events aren't logged.
All diagnostic settings may take up to90 minutesto start flowing to your selected destination.
Enabling connection logs can cause a small performance degradation to the cache instance.
Only theAnalytics Logspricing plan is supported when streaming logs to Azure Log Analytics. For more information, seeAzure Monitor pricing.
Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers
When you useOSS Cluster Policy, logs are emitted from each data node. When you useEnterprise Cluster Policy, only the node being used as a proxy emits logs. Both versions still cover all connections to the cache. This is just an architectural difference.
Data loss (that is, missing a connection event) is rare, but possible. Data loss is typically caused by networking issues.
Disconnection logs aren't yet fully stable and events may be missed.
Because connection logs on the Enterprise tiers are event-based, be careful of your retention policies. For instance, if retention is set to 10 days, and a connection event occurred 15 days ago, that connection might still exist, but the log for that connection isn't retained.
If usingactive geo-replication, logging must be configured for each cache instance in the geo-replication group individually.
All diagnostic settings may take up to90 minutesto start flowing to your selected destination.
Enabling connection logs may cause a small performance degradation to the cache instance.
Note
It is always possible to use theINFOorCLIENT LISTcommands to check who is connected to a cache instance on-demand.
Important
When selecting logs, you can chose either the specificCategoryorCategory groups, which are predefined groupings of logs across Azure services. When you useCategory groups,you can no longer configure the retention settings. If you need to determine retention duration for your connection logs, select the item in theCategoriessection instead.
Log Destinations
You can turn on diagnostic settings for Azure Cache for Redis instances and send resource logs to the following destinations:
Log Analytics workspace- doesn't need to be in the same region as the resource being monitored.
Storage account- must be in the same region as the cache.Premium storage accounts are not supportedas a destination, however.
Event hub- diagnostic settings can't access event hub resources when virtual networks are enabled. Enable theAllow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall?setting in event hubs to grant access to your event hub resources. The event hub must be in the same region as the cache.
Partner Solution- a list of potential partner logging solutions can be foundhere
For more information on diagnostic requirements, seediagnostic settings.
You're charged normal data rates for storage account and event hub usage when you send diagnostic logs to either destination. You're billed under Azure Monitor not Azure Cache for Redis. When sending logs toLog Analytics, you're only charged for Log Analytics data ingestion.
For more pricing information,Azure Monitor pricing.

Note
If private link is used, only a IPv6 address will be logged (unless you are streaming the data to log analytics). You can convert the IPv6 address to the equivalent IPv4 address by looking at the last four bytes of data in the IPv6 address. For instance, in the private link IPv6 address "fd40:8913:31:6810:6c31:200:a01:104", the last four bytes in hexadecimal are "0a", "01", "01", and "04". (Note that leading zeros are omitted after each colon.) These correspond to "10", "1", "1", and "4" in decimal, giving us the IPv4 address "10.1.1.4".
