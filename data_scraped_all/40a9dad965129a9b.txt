This article contains all the monitoring reference information for this service.
SeeMonitor Service Fabricfor details on the data you can collect for Azure Service Fabric and how to use it.
Azure Monitor doesn't collect any platform metrics or resource logs for Service Fabric. You can monitor and collect:
Service Fabric system, node, and application events. For the full event listing, seeList of Service Fabric events.

Windows performance counters on nodes and applications. For the list of performance counters, seePerformance metrics.

Cluster, node, and system service health data. You can use theFabricClient.HealthManager propertyto get the health client to use for health related operations, like report health or get entity health.

Metrics for the guest operating system (OS) that runs on a cluster node, through one or more agents that run on the guest OS.Guest OS metrics include performance counters that track guest CPU percentage or memory usage, which are frequently used for autoscaling or alerting. You can use the agent to send guest OS metrics to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can query them by using Log Analytics.NoteThe Azure Monitor agent replaces the previously-used Azure Diagnostics extension and Log Analytics agent. For more information, seeOverview of Azure Monitor agents.

Performance metrics
Metrics should be collected to understand the performance of your cluster as well as the applications running in it. For Service Fabric clusters, we recommend collecting the following performance counters.
Nodes
For the machines in your cluster, consider collecting the following performance counters to better understand the load on each machine and make appropriate cluster scaling decisions.
.NET applications and services
Collect the following counters if you are deploying .NET services to your cluster.
Service Fabric's custom performance counters
Service Fabric generates a substantial amount of custom performance counters. If you have the SDK installed, you can see the comprehensive list on your Windows machine in your Performance Monitor application (Start > Performance Monitor).
In the applications you are deploying to your cluster, if you are using Reliable Actors, add counters fromService Fabric ActorandService Fabric Actor Methodcategories (seeService Fabric Reliable Actors Diagnostics).

If you use Reliable Services or Service Remoting, we similarly haveService Fabric ServiceandService Fabric Service Methodcounter categories that you should collect counters from, seemonitoring with service remotingandreliable services performance counters.

If you use Reliable Collections, we recommend adding theAvg. Transaction ms/Commitfrom theService Fabric Transactional Replicatorto collect the average commit latency per transaction metric.

Activity log
The linked table lists the operations that can be recorded in the activity log for this service. These operations are a subset ofall the possible resource provider operations in the activity log.
