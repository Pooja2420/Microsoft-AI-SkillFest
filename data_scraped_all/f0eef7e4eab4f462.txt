This article shows you how to migrate on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) to Azure with theMigration and modernizationtool.
This tutorial is the third in a series that demonstrates how to assess and migrate machines to Azure.
Note
Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario so that you can quickly set up a proof of concept. Tutorials use default options where possible and don't show all possible settings and paths.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Add the Migration and modernization tool.
Discover VMs you want to migrate.
Start replicating VMs.
Run a test migration to make sure everything's working as expected.
Run a full VM migration.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, you should:
Reviewthe Hyper-V migration architecture.
ReviewHyper-V host requirements for migration and the Azure URLs to which Hyper-V hosts and clusters need access for VM migration.
Reviewthe requirements for Hyper-V VMs that you want to migrate to Azure.
We recommend that youassess Hyper-V VMsbefore you migrate them to Azure, but you don't have to.
Go to the already created project orcreate a new project.
Verify permissions for your Azure account. Your Azure account needs permissions to create a VM, write to an Azure managed disk, and manage failover operations for the Recovery Services vault associated with your Azure Migrate project.
Note
If you're planning to upgrade your Windows operating system (OS), Azure Migrate and Modernize might download the Windows SetupDiag for error details in case upgrade fails. Ensure that the VM created in Azure after the migration has access toSetupDiag. If there's no access to SetupDiag, you might not be able to get detailed OS upgrade failure error codes, but the upgrade can still proceed.
Download the provider
For migrating Hyper-V VMs, the Migration and modernization tool installs software providers (Azure Site Recovery provider and Recovery Services agent) on Hyper-V hosts or cluster nodes. TheAzure Migrate applianceisn't used for Hyper-V migration.
In the Azure Migrate project, selectServers, databases, and web apps>Migration and modernization>Discover.

After you install the provider on hosts, go to the Azure portal and inDiscover machines, selectFinalize registration.

It can take up to 15 minutes after finalizing registration until discovered VMs appear in theMigration and modernizationtile. As VMs are discovered, theDiscovered serverscount rises.
Replicate Hyper-V VMs
After discovery is finished, you can begin the replication of Hyper-V VMs to Azure.
Note
You can replicate up to 10 machines together. If you need to replicate more, replicate them simultaneously in batches of 10.

InCompute, review the VM name, size, OS disk type, and availability configuration (if selected in the previous step). VMs must conform withAzure requirements.VM size: If you're using assessment recommendations, the VM size dropdown list contains the recommended size. Otherwise, Azure Migrate and Modernize picks a size based on the closest match in the Azure subscription. Alternatively, pick a manual size inAzure VM size.OS disk: Specify the OS (boot) disk for the VM. The OS disk is the disk that has the operating system bootloader and installer.Availability Set: If the VM should be in an Azure availability set after migration, specify the set. The set must be in the target resource group you specify for the migration.

Note
You can update replication settings any time before replication starts inManage>Replicated machines. Settings can't be changed after replication starts.
Provision for the first time
If this is the first VM you're replicating in the Azure Migrate project, the Migration and modernization tool automatically provisions these resources in the same resource group as the project.
Cache storage account: The Site Recovery provider software installed on Hyper-V hosts uploads replication data for the VMs configured for replication to a storage account (known as the cache storage account or log storage account) in your subscription. Azure Migrate and Modernize then copies the uploaded replication data from the storage account to the replica-managed disks corresponding to the VM. The cache storage account needs to be specified while configuring replication for a VM. The Azure Migrate portal automatically creates one for the Azure Migrate project when replication is configured for the first time in the project.
Track and monitor
When you selectReplicate, a Start Replication job begins.
When the Start Replication job finishes successfully, the machines begin their initial replication to Azure.
After initial replication finishes, delta replication begins. Incremental changes to on-premises disks are periodically replicated to Azure.
You can track job status in the portal notifications.
You can monitor replication status by selectingReplicated serversinMigration and modernization.
Run a test migration
When delta replication begins, you can run a test migration for the VMs before you run a full migration to Azure. We highly recommend that you do this step at least once for each machine before you migrate it.
Running a test migration checks that migration works as expected, without affecting the on-premises machines, which remain operational and continue replicating.
Test migration simulates the migration by creating an Azure VM by using replicated data. (The test usually migrates to a nonproduction Azure virtual network in your Azure subscription.)
You can use the replicated test Azure VM to validate the migration, perform app testing, and address any issues before full migration.
To do a test migration:
InMigration goals, selectServers, databases, and web apps>Migration and modernization, selectâ¯Replicated serversunderReplications.

You can upgrade the Windows Server OS during test migration. For Hyper-V VMs, automatic detection of an OS isn't yet supported. To upgrade, select theCheck for upgradeoption. In the pane that appears, select the current OS version and the target version to which you want to upgrade. If the target version is available, it's processed accordingly.Learn more.
