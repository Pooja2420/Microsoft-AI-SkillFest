One of the most common monitoring requirements for a virtual machine is to create an alert if it stops running. The best method is to create a metric alert rule in Azure Monitor using theVM Availability Metricwhich is currently in public preview.
You can create an availability alert rule for a single virtual machine (VM) using the VM Availability Metric withrecommended alerts. This tutorial shows how to create a single rule that applies to all virtual machines in a subscription or resource group in a particular region.
Tip
While this article uses the metric valueVM Availability Metric,you can use the same process to alert on any metric value.
In this article, you learn how to:
View the VM availability metric in metrics explorer.
Create an alert rule targeting a subscription or resources group.
Create an action group to be proactively notified when an alert is created.
Prerequisites
To complete the steps in this article, you need at least one Azure virtual machine to monitor.
View VM availability metric in metrics explorer
There are multiple methods to create an alert rule in Azure Monitor. In this tutorial, we create it frommetrics explorer, which prefills required values such as the scope and metric we want to monitor. You just need to provide the detailed logic for the alert rule.
SelectMetricsfrom theMonitormenu in the Azure portal.

Set the following values for theAlert logic. This specifies that the alert fires whenever the average value of the availability metric falls below 1, which indicates that one of the VMs in the selected scope isn't running.SettingValueThresholdStaticAggregation TypeAverageOperatorLess thanUnitCountThreshold value1

Set the following values forWhen to evaluate. This specifies that the rule runs every minute, using the collected values from the previous minute.SettingValueCheck every1 minuteLoopback period1 minute

Configure action group
TheActionspage allows you to add one or moreaction groupsto the alert rule. Action groups define a set of actions to take when an alert is fired such as sending an email or an SMS message.

Configure different settings for the alert rule on theDetailspage.SettingDescriptionSubscriptionSubscription where the alert rule is stored.Resource groupResource group where the alert rule is stored. This doesn't need to be in the same resource group as the resource that you're monitoring.SeverityThe severity allows you to group alerts with a similar relative importance. A severity ofErroris appropriate for an unresponsive virtual machine.Alert rule nameName of the alert that shows when it fires.Alert rule descriptionOptional description of the alert rule.

View the alert
To test the alert rule, stop one or more virtual machines in the scope you specified. If you configured a notification in your action group, then you should receive that notification within a few seconds. You also see an alert for each VM on theAlertspage.

Next steps
Now that you have an alert in place when the VM goes down, enable VM insights to install the Azure Monitor agent which collects additional data from the client and provides additional analysis tools.
