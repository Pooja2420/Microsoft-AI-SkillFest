When the request is created, the subscription owner (the customer) is sent an email letting them know that they need to accept subscription ownership. The email contains a link used to accept ownership in the Azure portal. The customer must accept the request within seven days. If not accepted within seven days, the request expires. The person that created the request can also manually send their customer the ownership URL to accept the subscription.
After the request is created, it's visible in the Azure portal atSubscriptions>View Requestsby the following people:
The tenant global administrator of the source tenant where the subscription provisioning request is made.
The user who made the subscription creation request for the subscription being provisioned in the other tenant.
The user who made the request to provision the subscription in a different tenant than where they make theSubscription â Alias REST APIcall instead of the Azure portal.
The subscription owner in the request who resides in the target tenant doesn't see this subscription creation request on the View requests page. Instead, they receive an email with the link to accept ownership of the subscription in the target tenant.

Anyone with access to view the request can view its details. In the request details, theAccept ownership URLis visible. You can copy it to manually share it with the subscription owner in the target tenant for subscription ownership acceptance.
