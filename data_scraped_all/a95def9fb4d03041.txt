This article shows how to create a managed identity for Azure Load Testing. You can use a managed identity to securely read secrets or certificates from Azure Key Vault in your load test. You can also use managed identities to simulate managed identity based authentication flows in your load test scripts.
A managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID allows your load testing resource to easily access Microsoft Entra protected Azure Key Vault. The identity is managed by the Azure platform and doesn't require you to manage or rotate any secrets. For more information about managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID, seeManaged identities for Azure resources.
Azure Load Testing supports two types of identities:
Asystem-assigned identityis associated with your load testing resource and is deleted when your resource is deleted. A resource can only have one system-assigned identity.
Auser-assigned identityis a standalone Azure resource that you can assign to your load testing resource. When you delete the load testing resource, the managed identity remains available. You can assign multiple user-assigned identities to the load testing resource.
Currently, you can only use the managed identity for accessing Azure Key Vault.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
An Azure load testing resource. If you need to create an Azure load testing resource, see the quickstartCreate and run a load test.
To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs theManaged Identity Contributorrole assignment.
Assign a system-assigned identity to a load testing resource
To assign a system-assigned identity for your Azure load testing resource, enable a property on the resource. You can set this property by using the Azure portal or by using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.
Portal
Azure CLI
ARM template
To set up a managed identity in the portal, you first create an Azure load testing resource and then enable the feature.
In theAzure portal, go to your Azure load testing resource.
In theAzure portal, go to your Azure load testing resource.
On the left pane, selectIdentity.
On the left pane, selectIdentity.
In theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOn, and then selectSave.
In theSystem assignedtab, switchStatustoOn, and then selectSave.

On the confirmation window, selectYesto confirm the assignment of the managed identity.
On the confirmation window, selectYesto confirm the assignment of the managed identity.
After this operation completes, the page shows theObject IDof the managed identity, and lets you assign permissions to it.

Run theaz load updatecommand with--identity-type SystemAssignedto add a system-assigned identity to your load testing resource:
az load update
--identity-type SystemAssigned
az load update --name <load-testing-resource-name> --resource-group <group-name> --identity-type SystemAssigned
az load update --name <load-testing-resource-name> --resource-group <group-name> --identity-type SystemAssigned
You can use an ARM template to automate the deployment of your Azure resources. For more information about using ARM templates with Azure Load Testing, see theAzure Load Testing ARM reference documentation.
You can assign a system-assigned managed identity when you create a resource of typeMicrosoft.LoadTestService/loadtests. Configure theidentityproperty with theSystemAssignedvalue in the resource definition:
Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests
identity
SystemAssigned
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
By adding the system-assigned identity type, you're telling Azure to create and manage the identity for your resource. For example, an Azure load testing resource might look like the following:
{
    "type": "Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests",
    "apiVersion": "2021-09-01-preview",
    "name": "[parameters('name')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "tags": "[parameters('tags')]",
    "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned"
    }
}
{
    "type": "Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests",
    "apiVersion": "2021-09-01-preview",
    "name": "[parameters('name')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "tags": "[parameters('tags')]",
    "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned"
    }
}
After the resource creation finishes, the following properties are configured for the resource:
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "tenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "principalId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "tenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "principalId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
ThetenantIdproperty identifies which Microsoft Entra tenant the managed identity belongs to. TheprincipalIdis a unique identifier for the resource's new identity. Within Microsoft Entra ID, the service principal has the same name as the Azure load testing resource.

principalId
Assign a user-assigned identity to a load testing resource
Before you can add a user-assigned managed identity to an Azure load testing resource, you must first create this identity in Microsoft Entra ID. Then, you can assign the identity by using its resource identifier.
You can add multiple user-assigned managed identities to your resource. For example, if you need to access multiple Azure resources, you can grant different permissions to each of these identities.
Portal
Azure CLI
ARM template

Configure target resource
You might need to configure the target resource to allow access from your load testing resource. For example, if youread a secret or certificate from Azure Key Vault, or if youuse customer-managed keys for encryption, you must also add an access policy that includes the managed identity of your resource. Otherwise, your calls to Azure Key Vault are rejected, even if you use a valid token.
Similarly, if you want toset failure criteria on server metrics, you should specify a Metrics Reference Identity to fetch metrics for. You should configure the target resource such that the identity can read the metrics from the resource.
