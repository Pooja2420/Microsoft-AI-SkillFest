APPLIES TO:Azure CLI ml extensionv2 (current)
Themlextension to theAzure CLIis the enhanced interface for Azure Machine Learning. It enables you to train and deploy models from the command line, with features that accelerate scaling data science up and out while tracking the model lifecycle.

Prerequisites
To use the CLI, you must have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try thefree or paid version of Azure Machine Learningtoday.
To use the CLI commands in this document from yourlocal environment, you need theAzure CLI.
Installation
The new Machine Learning extensionrequires Azure CLI version>=2.38.0. Ensure this requirement is met:
>=2.38.0
az version
az version
If it isn't,upgrade your Azure CLI.
Check the Azure CLI extensions that are installed:
az extension list
az extension list
Remove any existing installation of themlextension and also the CLI v1azure-cli-mlextension:
ml
azure-cli-ml
az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml
az extension remove -n ml
az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml
az extension remove -n ml
Now, install themlextension:
ml
az extension add -n ml
az extension add -n ml
Run the help command to verify your installation and see available subcommands:
az ml -h
az ml -h
You can upgrade the extension to the latest version:
az extension update -n ml
az extension update -n ml
Installation on Linux
If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, the fastest way to install the necessary CLI version and the Machine Learning extension is:
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash 
az extension add -n ml -y
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash 
az extension add -n ml -y
For information on how to install on other Linux distributions, visitInstall the Azure CLI for Linux.
Set up
Sign in:
az login
az login
If you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions, you can set your active subscription:
az account set -s "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_OR_ID>"
az account set -s "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_OR_ID>"
Optionally, setup common variables in your shell for usage in subsequent commands:
GROUP="azureml-examples"

LOCATION="eastus"

WORKSPACE="main"
GROUP="azureml-examples"

LOCATION="eastus"

WORKSPACE="main"
Warning
This uses Bash syntax for setting variables. Adjust as needed for your shell. You can also replace the values in commands in the following examples inline rather than using variables.
If it doesn't already exist, you can create the Azure resource group:
az group create -n $GROUP -l $LOCATION
az group create -n $GROUP -l $LOCATION
And create a machine learning workspace:
az ml workspace create -n $WORKSPACE -g $GROUP -l $LOCATION
az ml workspace create -n $WORKSPACE -g $GROUP -l $LOCATION
Machine learning subcommands require the--workspace/-wand--resource-group/-gparameters. To avoid typing these repeatedly, configure defaults:
--workspace/-w
--resource-group/-g
az configure --defaults group=$GROUP workspace=$WORKSPACE location=$LOCATION
az configure --defaults group=$GROUP workspace=$WORKSPACE location=$LOCATION
Tip
Most code examples assume you have set a default workspace and resource group. You can override these on the command line.
You can show your current defaults using--list-defaults/-l:
--list-defaults/-l
az configure -l -o table
az configure -l -o table
Tip
Combining with--output/-oallows for more readable output formats.
--output/-o
Secure communications
ThemlCLI extension (sometimes called 'CLI v2') for Azure Machine Learning sends operational data (YAML parameters and metadata) over the public internet. All themlCLI extension commands communicate with the Azure Resource Manager. This communication is secured using HTTPS/TLS 1.2.

Data in a data store that is secured in a virtual network isn't_ sent over the public internet. For example, if your training data is located in the default storage account for the workspace, and the storage account is in a virtual network.
Note
With the previous extension (azure-cli-ml, sometimes called 'CLI v1'), only some of the commands communicate with the Azure Resource Manager. Specifically, commands that create, update, delete, list, or show Azure resources. Operations such as submitting a training job communicate directly with the Azure Machine Learning workspace. If your workspace issecured with a private endpoint, that is enough to secure commands provided by theazure-cli-mlextension.
azure-cli-ml

Public workspace
Private workspace
If your Azure Machine Learning workspace is public (that is, not behind a virtual network), then there's no extra configuration required. Communications are secured using HTTPS/TLS 1.2
If your Azure Machine Learning workspace uses a private endpoint and virtual network, choose one of the following configurations to use:
If you'reOKwith the CLI v2 communication over the public internet, use the following--public-network-accessparameter for theaz ml workspace updatecommand to enable public network access. For example, the following command updates a workspace for public network access:az ml workspace update --name myworkspace --public-network-access enabled
If you'reOKwith the CLI v2 communication over the public internet, use the following--public-network-accessparameter for theaz ml workspace updatecommand to enable public network access. For example, the following command updates a workspace for public network access:
--public-network-access
az ml workspace update
az ml workspace update --name myworkspace --public-network-access enabled
az ml workspace update --name myworkspace --public-network-access enabled
If you arenot OKwith the CLI v2 communication over the public internet, you can use an Azure Private Link to increase security of the communication. Use the following links to secure communications with Azure Resource Manager by using Azure Private Link.Secure your Azure Machine Learning workspace inside a virtual network using a private endpoint.Create a Private Link for managing Azure resources.Create a private endpointfor the Private Link created in the previous step.ImportantTo configure the private link for Azure Resource Manager, you must be thesubscription ownerfor the Azure subscription, and anownerorcontributorof the root management group.
