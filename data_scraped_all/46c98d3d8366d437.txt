Applies to this Azure Well-Architected Framework Reliability checklist recommendation:
This guide describes the recommendations for designing a reliable monitoring and alerting strategy. Implement this strategy to keep your operations teams informed of your environment's health status and ensure that you meet the established reliability targets for your workload.

Key design strategies
Before you create a monitoring and alerting strategy, perform the following tasks for your workload as part of your reliability planning:
Identifycritical and noncritical flows.

Performfailure mode analysis (FMA)for your flows.

Create a monitoring and alerting strategy to ensure that your workload operates reliably. A monitoring and alerting strategy provides awareness to your operations teams so they're notified of changes in your workload's condition and can quickly address issues. Build a robust and reliable monitoring strategy by creating ahealth modelfor your critical flows and the components that these critical flows comprise. The health model defines healthy, degraded, and unhealthy states. Design your operational posture to immediately catch changes in these states. When health states change from healthy to degraded or unhealthy, alerting mechanisms trigger theautomatic corrective measuresand notifies appropriate teams.
Implement the following recommendations to design a monitoring and alerting strategy that meets the requirements of your business.

Forward all diagnostic logs to a centralized data sink and analytics platform, like aLog Analytics workspace. If you have regional data sovereignty requirements, you must use local data sinks in the regions that are subject to those requirements.

Tradeoff: There are cost implications for storing and querying logs. Notice how your log analysis and retention affects your budget, and determine the best balance of utilization to meet your requirements. For more information, seeBest practices for cost optimization.
If your workloads are subject to one or more compliance frameworks, some of the component logs that handle sensitive information are also subject to those frameworks. Send the relevant component logs to a security information and event management (SIEM) system, likeMicrosoft Sentinel.

Configure alerts to trigger when values pass critical thresholds that correlate to a health model state change, like green to yellow or red.Threshold configuration is a practice of continuous improvement. As your workload evolves, the thresholds you define might change. In some cases,dynamic thresholdsare a good option for your monitoring strategy.

Consider using alerts when states improve, such as red to yellow or red to green, so that the operations teams can track these events for future reference.

Monitor applications
Create health probes orcheck functionsand run them regularly from outside the application. Ensure that you test from multiple locations that are geographically close to your customers.

Log data while the application runs in the production environment. You need sufficient information to diagnose the cause of issues in the production state.

Log events at service boundaries. Include a correlation ID that flows across service boundaries. If a transaction flows through multiple services and one of them fails, the correlation ID helps you track requests across your application and pinpoint why the transaction failed.

Use asynchronous logging. Synchronous logging operations sometimes block your application code, which causes requests to back up as logs are written. Use asynchronous logging to preserve availability during application logging.

Separate application logging from auditing. Audit records are commonly maintained for compliance or regulatory requirements and must be complete. To avoid dropped transactions, maintain audit logs separate from diagnostic logs.

Usetelemetry correlationto ensure that you can map transactions through the end-to-end application and critical system flows. This process is vital for performing root cause analysis (RCA) for failures. Collect platform-level metrics and logs, such as CPU percentage, network in, network out, and disk operations per second, from the application to inform a health model and to detect and predict issues. This approach can help distinguish between transient and nontransient faults.

Use white box monitoring to instrument the application with semantic logs and metrics. Collect application-level metrics and logs, such as memory consumption or request latency, from the application to inform a health model and to detect and predict issues.

Use black box monitoring to measure platform services and the resulting customer experience. Black box monitoring tests externally visible application behavior without knowledge of the internals of the system. This approach is common for measuring customer-centric service-level indicators (SLIs), service-level objectives (SLOs), and service-level agreements (SLAs).

Monitor data and storage
Monitor the availability metrics of your storage containers. When this metric drops below 100 percent, it indicates failing writes. Transient drops in availability might happen when your cloud provider manages the load. Track the availability trends to determine if there's an issue with your workload.In some cases, a drop in the availability metrics for a storage container indicates a bottleneck in the compute layer that's associated with the storage container.
