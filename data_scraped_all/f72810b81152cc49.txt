In this article
The Log Analytics agent, also known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA),is retiring in November 2024. As a result, the Defender for Servers and Defender for SQL on machines plans in Microsoft Defender for Cloud will be updated, and features that rely on the Log Analytics agent will be redesigned.
This article summarizes plans for agent retirement.
Prepare Defender for Servers
The Defender for Servers plan uses the Log Analytics agent in general availability (GA) and in AMA forsome features(in preview). Here's what's happening with these features going forward:
To simplify onboarding, all Defender for Servers security features and capabilities will be provided with a single agent (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint), complemented byagentless machine scanning, without any dependency on Log Analytics agent or AMA.
Defender for Servers features, which are based on AMA, are currently in preview and wonât be released in GA.â¯
Features in preview that rely on AMA remain supported until an alternate version of the feature is provided, which will rely on the Defender for Endpoint integration or the agentless machine scanning feature.
By enabling the Defender for Endpoint integration and agentless machine scanning feature before the deprecation takes place, your Defender for Servers deployment will be up to date and supported.
Feature functionality
The following table summarizes how Defender for Servers features will be provided. Most features are already generally available using Defender for Endpoint integration or agentless machine scanning. The rest of the features will either be available in GA by the time the MMA is retired, or will be deprecated.
Log analytics agent autoprovisioning experience - deprecation plan
As part of the MMA agent retirement, the auto provisioning capability that provides the installation and configuration of the agent for MDC customers, will be deprecated as well in 2 stages:
By the end of September 2024- auto provisioning of MMA will be disabled for customers that are no longer using the capability, as well as for newly created subscriptions:âExisting subscriptionsthat switch off MMA auto provisioning after end of September will no longer be able to enable the capability afterwards.â
By the end of September 2024- auto provisioning of MMA will be disabled for customers that are no longer using the capability, as well as for newly created subscriptions:â
Existing subscriptionsthat switch off MMA auto provisioning after end of September will no longer be able to enable the capability afterwards.â
Onnewly created subscriptionsauto provisioning can no longer be enabled and is automatically turned off.â
End of November 2024- the capability will be disabled on subscriptions that have not yet switched it off. From that point forward, it can no longer be possible to enable the capability on existing subscriptions.
The 500-MB benefit for data ingestion
To preserve the 500 MB of free data ingestion allowance for thesupported data types, you need to migrate from MMA to AMA.
Note
The benefit is granted to every AMA machine that is part of a subscription with Defender for Servers plan 2 enabled.

Changes to legacy Defender for Servers Plan 2 onboarding via Log Analytics agent
The legacy approach to onboard servers to Defender for Servers Plan 2 based on the Log Analytics agent and using Log analytics workspaces is set for retirement as well:
The onboarding experience foronboarding new non-Azure machinesto Defender for Servers using Log Analytics agents and workspaces is removed from theInventoryandGetting startedblades in the Defender for Cloud portal.

System update and patches recommendations experience - changes and migration guidance
System updates and patches are crucial for keeping the security and health of your machines. Updates often contain security patches for vulnerabilities that, if left unfixed, are exploitable by attackers.
System updates recommendations were previously provided by the Defender for Cloud Foundational CSPM and the Defender for Servers plans using the Log Analytics agent. This experience has been replaced by security recommendations that are gathered usingAzure Update Managerand constructed out of 2 new recommendations:
Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates
Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates
System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Azure Update Manager)

Once done, Update Manager can fetch the latest updates to the machines, and you can view the latest machine compliance status.
Note
Enabling periodic assessments for Arc enabled machines that Defender for Servers Plan 2 is not enabled on their related Subscription or Connector, is subject toAzure Update Manager pricing.Arc enabled machines that Defender for Servers Plan 2 is enabled on their related Subscription or Connectors, or any Azure VM, are eligible for this capability with no additional cost.
Endpoint protection recommendations experience - changes and migration guidance
Endpoint discovery and recommendations were previously provided by the Defender for Cloud Foundational CSPM and the Defender for Servers plans using the Log Analytics agent in GA, or in preview via the AMA. These experience have been replaced by security recommendations that are gathered using agentless machine scanning.
Endpoint protection recommendations are constructed in two stages. The first stage isdiscoveryof an endpoint detection and response solution. The second isâ¯assessmentof the solutionâs configuration. The following tables provide details of the current and new experiences for each stage.
Learn how tomanage the new endpoint detection and response recommendations (agentless).
The following table summarizes the timetable for recommendations being deprecated and replaced.
Thenew recommendationsexperience based on agentless machine scanning support both Windows and Linux OS across multicloud machines.
Current recommendations provided by the Log Analytics Agent or the AMA will be deprecated over time.
Some of these existing recommendations will be replaced by new recommendations based on agentless machine scanning.
Recommendations currently in GA remain in place until the Log Analytics agent retires.
Recommendations that are currently in preview will be replaced when the new recommendation is available in preview.
Recommendations that are currently in GA will continue to affect secure score.â¯
Current and upcoming new recommendations are located under the same Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark control, ensuring that thereâs no duplicate impact on secure score.
Ensure thatagentless machine scanning is enabledas part of Defender for Servers Plan 2 or Defender CSPM.
If suitable for your environment, for best experience we recommend that you remove deprecated recommendations when the replacement GA recommendation becomes available. To do that, disable the recommendation in thebuilt-in Defender for Cloud initiative in Azure Policy.
File Integrity Monitoring experience - changes and migration guidance
Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2 now offers a new File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) solution powered by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) integration. Once FIM powered by MDE is public, the FIM powered by AMA experience in the Defender for Cloud portal will be removed. In November, FIM powered by MMA will be deprecated.
If you currently use FIM over AMA:
Onboarding new subscriptions or servers to FIM based on AMA and the change tracking extension, as well as viewing changes, will no longer be available through the Defender for Cloud portal beginning May 30.

Baseline experience
The baselines misconfiguration feature on VMs is designed to ensure that your VMs adhere to security best practices and organizational policies. Baselines misconfiguration evaluates the configuration of your VMs against the predefined security baselines, and identifies any deviations, or misconfigurations that could pose a risk to your environment.
Machine information is collected for assessment using the Log Analytics agent (also known as the Microsoft Monitoring agent (MMA)). The MMA is set to be deprecated in November 2024, and the following changes will occur:
Machine information will be collected using theAzure Policy guest configuration.
Machine information will be collected using theAzure Policy guest configuration.
The following Azure policies are enabled with Azure Policy guest configuration:"Windows machines should meet requirements of the Azure compute security baseline""Linux machines should meet requirements for the Azure compute security baseline"NoteIf you remove these policies you won't be able to access the benefits of the Azure Policy guest configuration extension.

Important
Be aware that additional features provided by Azure Policy guest configuration that exist outside of the Defender for Cloud portal aren't included with Defender for Cloud, and are subject to Azure Policy guest configurations pricing policies. For exampleremediationandcustom policies. For more information, see theAzure Policy guest configuration pricing page.
Recommendations that are provided by the MCSB that aren't part of Windows and Linux compute security baselines, will continue to be part of free foundational CSPM.
Install Azure Policy guest configuration
In order to continue receiving the baseline experience, you need to enable the Defender for Servers Plan 2 and install the Azure Policy guest configuration. This will ensure that you continue to receive the same recommendations and hardening guidance that you have been receiving through the baseline experience.
Depending on your environment, you may need to take the following steps:

Once you have completed the necessary steps to install the Azure Policy guest configuration, you will automatically gain access to the baseline features based on the Azure Policy guest configuration. This will ensure that you continue to receive the same recommendations and hardening guidance that you have been receiving through the baseline experience.
Changes to recommendations
With the deprecation of the MMA, the following MMA based recommendations are set to be deprecated:
Machines should be configured securely
Auto provisioning of the Log Analytics agent should be enabled on subscriptions
The deprecated recommendations will be replaced by the following Azure Policy guest configuration base recommendations:
Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Windows machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)
Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Linux machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)
Guest Configuration extension should be installed on machines
Duplicate recommendations
When you enable Defender for Cloud on an Azure subscription, theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB), including compute security baselines that assess machine OS compliance, is enabled as a default compliance standard. Free foundational cloud security posture management (CSPM) in Defender for Cloud makes security recommendations based on the MCSB.
If a machine is running both the MMA and the Azure Policy guest configuration, you will see duplicate recommendations. The duplication of recommendations occurs because both methods are running at the same time and producing the same recommendations. These duplicates will affect your Compliance and Secure Score.
As a work-around, you can disable the MMA recommendations, "Machines should be configured securely", and "Auto provisioning of the Log Analytics agent should be enabled on subscriptions", by navigating to the Regulatory compliance page in Defender for Cloud.

Once you have located the recommendation, you should select the relevant machines and exempt them.

Some of the baseline configuration rules powered by the Azure Policy guest configuration tool are more current and offer broader coverage. As a result, transition to Baselines feature power by Azure Policy guest configuration can affect your compliance status since they include checks that might not have been performed previously.
Query recommendations
With the retirement of the MMA, Defender for Cloud no longer queries recommendations through the Log Analytic workspace information. Instead, Defender for Cloud now uses Azure Resource Graph for API, and portal queries, to query recommendation information.
Here are 2 sample queries you can use:
