When you no longer need a data disk that's attached to a virtual machine, you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the virtual machine, but doesn't remove it from storage.
Warning
If you detach a disk it is not automatically deleted. If you have subscribed to Premium storage, you will continue to incur storage charges for the disk. For more information, seePricing and Billing when using Premium Storage.
If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.
Prerequisites
Detach a data disk using PowerShell
You canhotremove a data disk using PowerShell, but make sure nothing is actively using the disk before detaching it from the VM.
In this example, we remove the disk namedmyDiskfrom the VMmyVMin themyResourceGroupresource group. First you remove the disk using theRemove-AzVMDataDiskcmdlet. Then, you update the state of the virtual machine, using theUpdate-AzVMcmdlet, to complete the process of removing the data disk.
$VirtualMachine = Get-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Name "myVM"
Remove-AzVMDataDisk `
  -VM $VirtualMachine `
  -Name "myDisk"
Update-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -VM $VirtualMachine
$VirtualMachine = Get-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -Name "myVM"
Remove-AzVMDataDisk `
  -VM $VirtualMachine `
  -Name "myDisk"
Update-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -VM $VirtualMachine
The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.
Lower latency
In select regions, the disk detach latency has been reduced, so you'll see an improvement of up to 15%. This is useful if you have planned/unplanned failovers between VMs, you're scaling your workload, or are running a high scale stateful workload such as Azure Kubernetes Service. However, this improvement is limited to the explicit disk detach command,Remove-AzVMDataDisk. You won't see the performance improvement if you call a command that may implicitly perform a detach, likeUpdate-AzVM. You don't need to take any action other than calling the explicit detach command to see this improvement.
Remove-AzVMDataDisk
Update-AzVM
Lower latency is currently available in every public region except for:
Canada Central
Central US
East US
East US 2
South Central US
West US 2
Germany North
India West
North Europe
