This article describes how to create Backup vaults and delete them.
A Backup vault is a storage entity in Azure that houses backup data for certain newer workloads that Azure Backup supports. You can use Backup vaults to hold backup data for various Azure services, such Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers and newer workloads that Azure Backup will support. Backup vaults make it easy to organize your backup data, while minimizing management overhead. Backup vaults are based on the Azure Resource Manager model of Azure, which provides theEnhanced capabilities to help secure backup data. With Backup vaults, Azure Backup provides security capabilities to protect cloud backups. The security features ensure you can secure your backups, and safely recover data, even if production and backup servers are compromised.Learn more

If you try to delete the vault without removing the dependencies, you'll encounter the following error messages:
Cannot delete the Backup vault as there are existing backup instances or backup policies in the vault. Delete all backup instances and backup policies that are present in the vault and then try deleting the vault.
