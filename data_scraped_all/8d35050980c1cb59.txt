Defender for APIs in Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers full lifecycle protection, detection, and response coverage for APIs.
Defender for APIs helps you to gain visibility into business-critical APIs. You can investigate and improve your API security posture, prioritize vulnerability fixes, and quickly detect active real-time threats.
This article describes how to enable and onboard the Defender for APIs plan in the Defender for Cloud portal. Alternately, you canenable Defender for APIs within an API Management instancein the Azure portal.

You must select a plan that grants entitlement appropriate for the API traffic volume in your subscription to receive the most optimal pricing. By default, subscriptions are opted into "Plan 1", which can lead to unexpected overages if your subscription has API traffic higher than theone million API calls entitlement.

Enable the Defender for APIs plan
When selecting a plan, consider these points:
Defender for APIs protects only those APIs that are onboarded to Defender for APIs. This means you can activate the plan at the subscription level, and complete the second step of onboarding by fixing the onboarding recommendation.
Defender for APIs has five pricing plans, each with a different entitlement limit and monthly fee. The billing is done at the subscription level.
Billing is applied to the entire subscription based on the total amount of API traffic monitored over the month for the subscription.
The API traffic counted towards the billing is reset to 0 at the start of each month (every billing cycle).
The overages are computed on API traffic exceeding the entitlement limit per plan selection during the month for your entire subscription.
To select the best plan for your subscription from the Microsoft Defender for Cloudpricing page, follow these steps and choose the plan that matches your subscriptionsâ API traffic requirements:
Sign into theportal, and in Defender for Cloud, selectEnvironment settings.

Select the optimal plan based on historical Azure API Management API traffic usage
You must select a plan that grants entitlement appropriate for the API traffic volume in your subscription to receive the most optimal pricing. By default, subscriptions are opted intoPlan 1, which can lead to unexpected overages if your subscription has API traffic higher than theone million API calls entitlement.
To estimate the monthly API traffic in Azure API Management:
Navigate to the Azure API Management portal and selectMetricsunder the Monitoring menu bar item.
Navigate to the Azure API Management portal and selectMetricsunder the Monitoring menu bar item.

Select the time range asLast 30 days.
Select the time range asLast 30 days.
Select and set the following parameters:Scope:Azure API Management Service NameMetric Namespace:API Management service standard metricsMetric =RequestsAggregation =Sum
Select and set the following parameters:
Scope:Azure API Management Service Name
Metric Namespace:API Management service standard metrics
Metric =Requests
Aggregation =Sum
After setting the above parameters, the query will automatically run, and the total number of requests for the past 30 days appears at the bottom of the screen. In the screenshot example, the query results in 414 total number of requests.NoteThese instructions are for calculating the usage per Azure API management service. To calculate the estimated traffic usage forallAPI management services within the Azure subscription, change theScopeparameter to each Azure API management service within the Azure subscription, re-run the query, and sum the query results.

If you don't have access to run the metrics query, reach out to your internal Azure API Management administrator or your Microsoft account manager.
Note
After enabling Defender for APIs, onboarded APIs take up to 50 minutes to appear in theRecommendationstab. Security insights are available in theWorkload protections>API securitydashboard within 40 minutes of onboarding.
