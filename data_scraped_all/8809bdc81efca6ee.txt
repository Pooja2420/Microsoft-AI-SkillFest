This article explains the limitations of Azure Communication Services APIs and possible resolutions.
Throttling patterns and architecture
When you reach service limitations, you receive an HTTP status code 429 (too many requests). In general, follow these best practices for throttling:
Reduce the number of operations per request.
Reduce the frequency of calls.
Avoid immediate retries because all requests accrue against your usage limits.
Find more general guidance on how to set up your service architecture to handle throttling and limitations in theAzure architecturedocumentation forthrottling patterns. To increase throttling limits, make a request toAzure Support.
Open theAzure portaland sign in.
SelectHelp+Support.
SelectCreate new support request.
In theDescribe your issuetext box, enterTechnical, and then selectGo.
From theSelect a servicedropdown menu, selectService and Subscription Limits (Quotas), and then selectNext.

Identity
createUserAndToken
exchangeTokens
Action to take
We recommend that you acquire identities and tokens before you create chat threads or start calls. For example, do this task when the webpage loads or the application starts.
For more information, seeAuthenticate to Azure Communication Services.
SMS
When you send or receive a high volume of messages, you might receive a429error. This error indicates that you're about to reach the service limitations. Your messages are queued and are sent after the number of requests is below the threshold.

Rate limits for SMS:
Action to take
If you have requirements that exceed the rate limits, submit a request toAzure Supportto enable higher throughput.
For more information on the SMS SDK and service, seeSMS SDK overviewor theSMS FAQ.
Email
You can send a limited number of email messages. If you exceed theemail rate limitsfor your subscription, your requests are rejected. You can attempt these requests again, after the Retry-After time passes. Take action before reaching the limit by requesting to raise your sending volume limits if needed.
The Azure Communication Services email service is designed to support high throughput. However, the service imposes initial rate limits to help customers onboard smoothly and avoid some of the issues that can occur when switching to a new email service.
We recommend gradually increasing your email volume using Azure Communication Services Email over a period of two to four weeks, while closely monitoring the delivery status of your emails. This gradual increase enables third-party email service providers to adapt to the change in IP for your domain's email traffic. The gradual change gives you time to protect your sender reputation and maintain the reliability of your email delivery.
Azure Communication Services email service supports high volume up to 1-2 million messages per hour. High throughput can be enabled based on several factors, including:
Customer peak traffic
Business needs
Ability to manage failure rates
Domain reputation
Failure Rate Requirements
To enable a high email quota, your email failure rate must be less than one percent (1%). If your failure rate is high, you must resolve the issues before requesting a quota increase.
Customers are expected to actively monitor their failure rates.
If the failure rate increases after a quota increase, Azure Communication Services will contact the customer for immediate action and a resolution timeline. In extreme cases, if the failure rate isn't managed within the specified timeline, Azure Communication Services may reduce or suspend service until the issue is resolved.
Azure Communication Services provides rich logs and analytics to help monitor and manage failure rates. For more information, see the following articles:
Improve sender reputation in Azure Communication Services email.
Email Insights.
Enable logs via Diagnostic Settings in Azure Monitor.
Handle Email events.
Manage domain suppression lists in Azure Communication Services using the management client libraries.
Note
To request higher limits, follow the instructions atQuota increase for email domains. Higher quotas are only available for verified custom domains, not Azure-managed domains.
Rate Limits for Email
Custom Domains
The following table lists limits forAzure managed domains.
Size limits for email
For all message size limits, consider that Base64 encoding increases the size of the message. You need to increase the size value to account for the message size increase that occurs after the message attachments and any other binary data are Base64 encoded. Base64 encoding increases the size of the message by about 33%, so the message size is about 33% larger than the message sizes before encoding. For example, if you specify a maximum message size value of approximately 10 MB, you can expect a realistic maximum message size value of approximately 7.5 MB.
Resource limits
Send attachments larger than 10 MB
To email file attachments up to 30 MB, make asupport request.
If you need to send email file attachments larger than 30 MB, use this alternative solution. Store the files in an Azure Blob Storage account and include a link to the files in your email. You can secure the files with a shared access signature (SAS). A SAS provides secure delegated access to resources in your storage account. By using a SAS, you have granular control over how clients can access your data.
Benefits of using a Blob Storage account:
You can handle large-scale files.
You can use a SAS or keys to precisely manage file access.
For more information, see:
Introduction to Azure Blob Storage
Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources by using shared access signatures
Action to take
To increase your email quota, follow the instructions inQuota increase for email domains.
Note
Email quota increase requests might take up to 72 hours for evaluation and approval, especially for requests that come in on Friday afternoon.
The quota increase requests for the number of recipients in email of SMTP is not supported at this time.
Chat
Azure Communication Services supports chat.

Rate limits for chat
Note
Read receipts and typing indicators aren't supported on chat threads with more than 20 participants.
Chat storage
Azure Communication Services stores chat messages according to the retention policy that you set when you create a chat thread.
Important
This feature of Azure Communication Services is currently in preview. Features in preview are publicly available and can be used by all new and existing Microsoft customers.
This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or capabilities might be constrained.
For more information, seeSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.
You can choose between indefinite message retention or automatic deletion between 30 and 90 days via the retention policy on theCreate Chat Thread API. Alternatively, you can choose not to set a retention policy on a chat thread.
If you have strict compliance needs, we recommend that you use theDelete Chat ThreadAPI to delete chat threads. Any threads created before the new retention policy aren't affected unless you specifically change the policy for that thread.
Note
If you accidentally delete messages, the system can't recover them. If you submit a support request for a deleted chat thread after the retention policy deletes that thread, it can't be retrieved. Information about that thread is no longer available. If needed, open a support ticket as quickly as possible within the 30-day window after you created a thread so that we can assist you.
Voice and video calling
Azure Communication Services supports voice and video calling.
PSTN call limitations
Note
There are no limits on inbound concurrent calls. You can also submit a request toAzure Supportto increase the limit for outbound concurrent calls. Our vetting team reviews all requests.
Call maximum limitations
Calling SDK streaming support
The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK supports the following streaming configurations:
The Calling SDK doesn't enforce these limits, but your users might experience performance degradation if you exceed these limits.
Calling SDK timeouts
The following timeouts apply to the Azure Communication Services Calling SDKs:
Virtual Rooms
The throttling policies of rooms service are determined by grouping requests throughresource id.
Action to take
For more information about the voice and video calling SDK and service, seeCalling SDK overvieworKnown issues in the SDKs and APIs. You can also submit a request toAzure Supportto increase some of the limits. Our vetting team reviews all requests.
Job Router
When you send or receive a high volume of requests, you might receive aThrottleLimitExceededExceptionerror. This error indicates that you're reaching the service limitations. Your requests fail until the token bucket that's used to handle requests is replenished after a certain time.
ThrottleLimitExceededException
Rate limits for Job Router
Action to take
If you need to send a volume of messages that exceeds the rate limits, email us at acs-ccap@microsoft.com.
Teams interoperability and Microsoft Graph
By using a Teams interoperability scenario, you likely use some Microsoft Graph APIs to createmeetings.
Each service offered through Microsoft Graph has different limitations. Service-specific limits are described onthis webpagein more detail.
Action to take
When you implement error handling, use the HTTP error code 429 to detect throttling. The failed response includes theRetry-Afterresponse header. Use theRetry-Afterdelay to back off requests. It's the fastest way to recover from throttling because Microsoft Graph continues to log resource use while a client is throttled.
