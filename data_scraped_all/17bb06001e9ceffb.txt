Specifically, Analytics provides you with insights about your Azure DevOps projects through the following tools:
Analytics widgets that you can add to your dashboards
In-context Analytics reports available from select Azure DevOps pages
Rollup bars and counts for Azure Boards backlogs
Custom reports you can create using Power BI
Custom reports you can create using OData queries
Support to develop and add your custom Analytics widgets you can add to dashboards

Data available in Analytics
Analytics is generally available for Azure DevOps Service and Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. It is in preview for Azure DevOps Server 2019. The service provides a concise data model over Azure DevOps.
Data available via the Analytics service depends on your version and platform.   For specifics, readData available in AnalyticsandData model for Analytics.
Analytics is enabled for all Azure DevOps Services projects and automatically populates itself with all available Azure DevOps data. Once populated, it updates itself as data changes occur. For more information, readData available in AnalyticsandPerformance and latency.

Dashboard widgets
You can createdashboardsandadd widgets to them. We provide severalwidgets based on Analytics. These widgets take advantage of the power of Analytics. Widgets provide the easiest way to get insights from your data.
For example, the Velocity widget shown in the following image provides insights into a team's historical performance over six iterations.

Here, the Velocity widget shows that this team has a history of closing stories late. It also shows a discrepancy between planned and completed work across all the sprints displayed. The team can drill into the data to determine the root causes. After implementing new practices, the team can use the Velocity widget to track their effectiveness.
Check outAdd an Analytics widget to a dashboardfor a step-by-step guide to get started with the Velocity widget.
If you want to develop your own widget based on Analytics, seeCreate an Analytics widget.
In-context reports and roll-up columns
Work tracking in-context reports are now based on Analytics data. These reports appear on theAnalyticstab of the product and portfolio backlogs and boards. Also, there are some pipelines and test in-context reports. For more information, see the following articles:
Cumulative flow
Team velocity
View/configure sprint burndown
Pipeline pass rate report
Test failures report
Also, you can add rollup columns to product and portfolio backlogs that provide progress bars, counts of work items, or sums of selected fields. For details, seeDisplay rollup progress or totals.
Analytic views
Analytics views is a web portal feature that supports filtering work tracking data for status and trend reports. With Analytics views, you can use default or custom views to generate reports in Power BI. Power BI provides a data connector for Analytics views.

Metadata & OData queries
Analytics is fully accessible via OData. From a web browser, you can query the Analytics metadata or data using an OData query. To learn how, seeConstruct OData queries for Analytics.
