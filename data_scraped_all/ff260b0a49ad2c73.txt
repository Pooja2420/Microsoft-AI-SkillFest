The tables in this article provide information on ExpressRoute geographical coverage and locations, ExpressRoute connectivity providers, and ExpressRoute System Integrators (SIs).
Note
Azure regions and ExpressRoute locations are two distinct and different concepts, understanding the difference between the two is critical to exploring Azure hybrid networking connectivity.
Azure regions
Azure regions are global datacenters where Azure compute, networking, and storage resources are hosted. When creating an Azure resource, you need to select the resource location, which determines the specific Azure datacenter (or availability zone) where the resource is deployed.
ExpressRoute locations
ExpressRoute locations, also known as peering locations or meet-me locations, are co-location facilities where Microsoft Enterprise Edge (MSEE) devices are situated. These locations serve as the entry points to Microsoft's network and are globally distributed, offering the ability to connect to Microsoft's network worldwide. ExpressRoute partners and ExpressRoute Direct user establish cross connections to Microsoft's network at these locations. Generally, the ExpressRoute location doesn't need to correspond with the Azure region. For instance, you can create an ExpressRoute circuit with the resource location inEast USfor theSeattlepeering location.
You have access to Azure services across all regions within a geopolitical region if you're connecting to at least one ExpressRoute location within the geopolitical region.

The following table provides a map of Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region.

Connectivity across geopolitical regions isn't supported on the standard ExpressRoute SKU. You'll need to enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on to support global connectivity. Connectivity to national cloud environments isn't supported. You can work with your connectivity provider if such a need arises.
ExpressRoute connectivity providers
The following table shows locations by service provider. If you want to view available providers by location, seeService providers by location.

National cloud environment
Azure national clouds are isolated from each other and from the Azure public cloud. ExpressRoute for one Azure cloud can't connect to the Azure regions in the others.
US Government cloud
China cloud

Connectivity through Exchange providers
If your connectivity provider isn't listed in previous sections, you can still create a connection.
Check with your connectivity provider to see if they're connected to any of the exchanges in the table above. You can check the following links to gather more information about services offered by exchange providers. Several connectivity providers are already connected to Ethernet exchanges.CologixCoreSiteDE-CIXEquinix Cloud ExchangeInterxionIX ReachMegaportMomentum TelecomNextDCPacketFabricTeraco
