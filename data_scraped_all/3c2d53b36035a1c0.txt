Azure Automation DSC for Linux has retired on 30 September 2023. For more information, see theannouncement.
This article covers how to unregister a node managed by Automation State Configuration, and safely
removes a PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration from managed nodes. For both
Windows and Linux nodes, you need tounregister the nodeandDelete a configuration from the node. For Linux nodes only, you can optionally delete the DSC
packages from the nodes as well. SeeRemove the DSC package from a Linux node.
Unregister a node
Note
Unregistering a node from the service only sets the Local Configuration Manager settings so the
node is no longer connecting to the service. This doesn't affect the configuration that's
currently applied to the node, and leaves the related files in place on the node. After you
unregister/delete the node, to re-register it, clear the existing configuration files. SeeDelete a configuration from the node.
If you no longer want to manage a node using DSC, you can unregister it from the Azure portal or
with Azure PowerShell using the following steps.

Delete a Linux configuration
To delete the node's configuration, remove the.mofconfiguration files stored in the/etc/opt/omi/conf/dsc/configuration/directory.
.mof
/etc/opt/omi/conf/dsc/configuration/
Re-register a node
You can re-register a node just as you registered the node initially, using any of the methods
described inEnable Azure Automation State Configuration
Remove the DSC package from a Linux node
This step is optional. Unregistering a Linux node from State Configuration (DSC) doesn't remove the
DSC and OMI packages from the machine. Use the following commands to remove the packages, all logs,
and related data.
To find the package names and other relevant details, see thePowerShell Desired State Configuration for LinuxGitHub repository.
RPM-based systems
rpm -e <package name>
rpm -e <package name>
dpkg-based systems
dpkg -P <package name>
dpkg -P <package name>
Next steps
If you want to re-register the node, or register a new one, seeRegister a VM to be managed by State Configuration.
If you want to add the configuration back and recompile, seeCompile DSC configurations in Azure Automation State Configuration.
