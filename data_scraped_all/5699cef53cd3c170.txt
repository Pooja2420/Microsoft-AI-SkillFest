This article provides guidance on how to use Microsoft Entra policies to manage personal access tokens (PATs) in Azure DevOps. It explains how to limit the creation, scope, and lifespan of new or renewed PATs, and how to handle the automatic revocation of leaked PATs. Each section details the default behavior of the respective policies, helping administrators effectively control and secure PAT usage within their organization.
Important
Existing PATs, created through both the UI and APIs, remain valid for the rest of their lifespan. Update your existing PATs to comply with the new restrictions to ensure successful renewal.
Prerequisites
Important
We recommend usingMicrosoft Entra tokens. For more information about our efforts to reduce PAT usage, seeour blog.

Restrict creation of global PATs
The Azure DevOps Administrator in Microsoft Entra can restrict users from creating global Personal Access Tokens (PATs), which apply to all accessible organizations rather than a single organization. When this policy is enabled, new PATs must be associated with specific Azure DevOps organizations. By default, this policy is set tooff.
Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}).

Restrict creation of full-scoped PATs
The Azure DevOps Administrator in Microsoft Entra can restrict users from creating full-scoped PATs. Enabling this policy requires new PATs to be limited to a specific, custom-defined set of scopes. By default, this policy is set tooff.

Add Microsoft Entra users or groups to the allowlist
Warning
We recommend using groups for your tenant policy allowlists. If you use a named user, a reference to their identity resides in the United States, Europe (EU), and Southeast Asia (Singapore).
Users or groups on the allowlist are exempt from the restrictions and enforcements of these policies when enabled. To add a user or group, selectAdd Microsoft Entra user or group, then selectAdd. Each policy has its own allowlist. If a user is on the allowlist for one policy, other activated policies still apply. Therefore, to exempt a user from all policies, add them to each allowlist.
Revoke leaked PATs automatically
TheAzure DevOps Administrator in Microsoft Entra IDcan manage the policy that automatically revokes leaked PATs. This policy applies to all PATs within organizations linked to your Microsoft Entra tenant. By default, this policy is set toon. If Azure DevOps PATs are checked into public GitHub repositories, they're automatically revoked.
Warning
Disabling this policy means any PATs checked into public GitHub repositories remain active, potentially compromising your Azure DevOps organization and data, and putting your applications and services at significant risk. Even with the policy disabled, you still receive an email notification if a PAT is leaked, but it isn't revoked automatically.
Turn off automatic revocation of leaked PATs
