To use an ExpressRoute circuit for both the classic and Resource Manager deployment models, you must move the circuit to the Resource Manager deployment model. The following sections help you move your circuit by using PowerShell.
Before you begin
The steps and examples in this article use Azure PowerShell Az modules. To install the Az modules locally on your computer, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn more about the new Az module, seeIntroducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module. PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. If you are not running the latest version, the values specified in the instructions may fail. To find the installed versions of PowerShell on your system, use theGet-Module -ListAvailable Azcmdlet.
Get-Module -ListAvailable Az
Verify that you have installed both the classic and Az Azure PowerShell modules locally on your computer. For more information, seeHow to install and configure Azure PowerShell.
Make sure that you have reviewed theprerequisites,routing requirements, andworkflowsbefore you begin configuration.
Review the information that is provided underMoving an ExpressRoute circuit from classic to Resource Manager. Make sure that you fully understand the limits and limitations.
Verify that the circuit is fully operational in the classic deployment model.
Ensure that you have a resource group that was created in the Resource Manager deployment model.
Move an ExpressRoute circuit
Step 1: Gather circuit details from the classic deployment model
Sign in to the Azure classic environment and gather the service key.
Sign in to your Azure account.Add-AzureAccount
Sign in to your Azure account.
Add-AzureAccount
Add-AzureAccount
Select the appropriate Azure subscription.Select-AzureSubscription "<Enter Subscription Name here>"
Select the appropriate Azure subscription.
Select-AzureSubscription "<Enter Subscription Name here>"
Select-AzureSubscription "<Enter Subscription Name here>"
Import the PowerShell modules for Azure and ExpressRoute.Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\Azure\Azure.psd1'
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\ExpressRoute\ExpressRoute.psd1'
Import the PowerShell modules for Azure and ExpressRoute.
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\Azure\Azure.psd1'
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\ExpressRoute\ExpressRoute.psd1'
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\Azure\Azure.psd1'
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\ExpressRoute\ExpressRoute.psd1'
Use the cmdlet below to get the service keys for all of your ExpressRoute circuits. After retrieving the keys, copy theservice keyof the circuit that you want to move to the Resource Manager deployment model.Get-AzureDedicatedCircuit

Step 2: Sign in and create a resource group
Sign in to the Resource Manager environment and create a new resource group.
Sign in to your Azure Resource Manager environment.Connect-AzAccount
Sign in to your Azure Resource Manager environment.

Select the appropriate Azure subscription.Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "<Enter Subscription Name here>" | Select-AzSubscription
Select the appropriate Azure subscription.
Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "<Enter Subscription Name here>" | Select-AzSubscription
Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "<Enter Subscription Name here>" | Select-AzSubscription
Modify the snippet below to create a new resource group if you don't already have a resource group.New-AzResourceGroup -Name "DemoRG" -Location "West US"
Modify the snippet below to create a new resource group if you don't already have a resource group.
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "DemoRG" -Location "West US"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "DemoRG" -Location "West US"
Step 3: Move the ExpressRoute circuit to the Resource Manager deployment model
You are now ready to move your ExpressRoute circuit from the classic deployment model to the Resource Manager deployment model. Before proceeding, review the information provided inMoving an ExpressRoute circuit from the classic to the Resource Manager deployment model.
To move your circuit, modify and run the following snippet:
Move-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG" -Location "West US" -ServiceKey "<Service-key>"
Move-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG" -Location "West US" -ServiceKey "<Service-key>"
In classic mode, an ExpressRoute circuit does not have the concept of being tied to a region. However, in Resource Manager, every resource needs to be mapped to an Azure region. The region specified in the Move-AzExpressRouteCircuit cmdlet can technically be any region. For organizational purposes, you may want to choose a region that closely represents your peering location.
Note
After moving your classic ExpressRoute circuit to the Resource Manager deployment model, it will have access to both the classic and Resource Manager deployment models by default.
The new name that is listed in the previous cmdlet will be used to address the resource. The circuit will essentially be renamed.
Modify circuit access
To enable ExpressRoute circuit access for both deployment models
You can enable access to the classic deployment model for ExpressRoute circuits that were created in the Resource Manager deployment model. Run the following cmdlets to enable access to both deployment models:
Get the circuit details.$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
Get the circuit details.
$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
Set "Allow Classic Operations" to TRUE.$ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $true
Set "Allow Classic Operations" to TRUE.
$ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $true
$ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $true
Update the circuit. After this operation has finished successfully, you will be able to view the circuit in the classic deployment model.Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
Update the circuit. After this operation has finished successfully, you will be able to view the circuit in the classic deployment model.
Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
Run the following cmdlet to get the details of the ExpressRoute circuit. You must be able to see the service key listed.get-azurededicatedcircuit
Run the following cmdlet to get the details of the ExpressRoute circuit. You must be able to see the service key listed.

You can now manage links to the ExpressRoute circuit using the classic deployment model commands for classic VNets, and the Resource Manager commands for Resource Manager VNets. The following articles help you manage links to the ExpressRoute circuit:Link your virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit in the Resource Manager deployment modelLink your virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit in the classic deployment model

To disable ExpressRoute circuit access to the classic deployment model
Run the following cmdlets to disable access to the classic deployment model.
Get details of the ExpressRoute circuit.$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
Get details of the ExpressRoute circuit.
$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
$ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
Set "Allow Classic Operations" to FALSE.$ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $false
Set "Allow Classic Operations" to FALSE.
$ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $false
$ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $false
Update the circuit. After this operation has finished successfully, you will not be able to view the circuit in the classic deployment model.Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
