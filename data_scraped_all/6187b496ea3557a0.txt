The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) that run in Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and in on-premises environments. Defender for Servers provides recommendations to improve the security posture of machines and protects machines against security threats.
This article helps you deploy a Defender for Servers plan.
