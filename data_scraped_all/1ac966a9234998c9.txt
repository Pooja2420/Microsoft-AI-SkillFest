Adashboardin the Azure portal is a focused and organized view of your cloud resources. This quickstart shows how to use Azure CLI to create a dashboard. The example dashboard shows the performance of a virtual machine (VM), along with some static information and links.
In addition to the prerequisites listed here, you need an Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Prerequisites
Use the Bash environment inAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell.

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, seeUse and manage extensions with the Azure CLI.Runaz versionto find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, runaz upgrade.

If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, choose the appropriate subscription in which to bill the resources.
Select a subscription by using theaz account setcommand:az account set --subscription aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e

Create a virtual machine
Important
The steps outlined in this quickstart are solely for education purposes and aren't intended for deployments to a production environment. For information about best practices for production virtual machines, see thesecurity best practices for VMs and operating systems.
The example dashboard requires a virtual machine. If you have a VM already, you can update your template to use that VM. Otherwise, you can create an example VM to use in this dashboard by using theaz vm createcommand:
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM1 --image win2016datacenter \
   --admin-username azureuser --admin-password 1StrongPassword$
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM1 --image win2016datacenter \
   --admin-username azureuser --admin-password 1StrongPassword$
Note
This is a new username and password (not the account you use to sign in to Azure). The password must be complex. For more information, seeusername requirementsandpassword requirements.
The deployment starts and typically takes a few minutes to complete.
Download the dashboard template
Since Azure dashboards are resources, they can be represented as JSON. For more information, seeThe structure of Azure dashboards.
Download the fileportal-dashboard-template-testvm.json.
Then, customize the downloaded template file by changing the following to your values:
<subscriptionID>: Your subscription
<subscriptionID>
<rgName>: Resource group, for examplemyResourceGroup
<rgName>
myResourceGroup
<vmName>: Virtual machine name, for examplemyVM1
<vmName>
myVM1
<dashboardTitle>: Dashboard title, for exampleSimple VM Dashboard
<dashboardTitle>
Simple VM Dashboard
<location>: Your Azure region, for examplecentralus
<location>
centralus
For more information, seeMicrosoft portal dashboards template reference.
Deploy the dashboard template
You can now deploy the template from within Azure CLI.
Run theaz portal dashboard createcommand to deploy the template:az portal dashboard create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
   --input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
Run theaz portal dashboard createcommand to deploy the template:
az portal dashboard create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
   --input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
az portal dashboard create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
   --input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
Check that the dashboard was created successfully by running theaz portal dashboard showcommand:az portal dashboard show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard'
Check that the dashboard was created successfully by running theaz portal dashboard showcommand:
az portal dashboard show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard'
az portal dashboard show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard'
To see all the dashboards for the current subscription, useaz portal dashboard list:
az portal dashboard list
az portal dashboard list
You can also see all the dashboards for a specific resource group:
az portal dashboard list --resource-group myResourceGroup
az portal dashboard list --resource-group myResourceGroup
To update a dashboard, use theaz portal dashboard updatecommand:
az portal dashboard update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
   --input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
az portal dashboard update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
   --input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
Review deployed resources
Verify that you can see data about your virtual machine in the Azure portal dashboard.
In the Azure portal menu, selectDashboard.
In the Azure portal menu, selectDashboard.

On the dashboard page, selectSimple VM Dashboard.
On the dashboard page, selectSimple VM Dashboard.

Review the dashboard, which should look similar to the one shown here. While some of the content is static, there are also charts that show the performance of the VM you created at the beginning.

Clean up resources
To remove the virtual machine and associated dashboard that you created, delete the resource group that contains them.
Caution
Deleting the resource group will delete all of the resources contained within it. If the resource group contains additional resources aside from your virtual machine and dashboard, those resources will also be deleted.
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
