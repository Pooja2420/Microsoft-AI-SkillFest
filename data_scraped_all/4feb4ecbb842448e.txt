Azure Network Watcher is a regional service that enables you to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network scenario level in, to, and from Azure. Scenario level monitoring enables you to diagnose problems at an end to end network level view. Network diagnostic and visualization tools available with Network Watcher help you understand, diagnose, and gain insights to your network in Azure.
Network Watcher is enabled in an Azure region through the creation of a Network Watcher instance in that region. This instance allows you to utilize Network Watcher capabilities in that particular region.
Note
By default, Network Watcher is automatically enabled. When you create or update a virtual network in your subscription, Network Watcher will be automatically enabled in your Virtual Network's region.
Automatically enabling Network Watcher doesn't affect your resources or associated charge.
If you previously chose toopt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement, you must manuallyenable Network Watcherin each region where you want to use Network Watcher capabilities. For more information, seeNetwork Watcher Azure regions.

Enable Network Watcher for your region
If you choose toopt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement, you must manually enable Network Watcher in each region where you want to use Network Watcher capabilities. To enable Network Watcher in a region, create a Network Watcher instance in that region using theAzure portal,PowerShell, theAzure CLI,REST API, or anAzure Resource Manager template (ARM template).
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
In the search box at the top of the portal, enternetwork watcher. SelectNetwork Watcherfrom the search results.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enternetwork watcher. SelectNetwork Watcherfrom the search results.

On theOverviewpage, select+ Create.
On theOverviewpage, select+ Create.
OnAdd network watcher, select your Azure subscription, then select the region that you want to enable Azure Network Watcher for.
OnAdd network watcher, select your Azure subscription, then select the region that you want to enable Azure Network Watcher for.
SelectAdd.
SelectAdd.

Note
When you create a Network Watcher instance using the Azure portal:
The name of the Network Watcher instance is automatically set toNetworkWatcher_region, whereregioncorresponds to the Azure region of the Network Watcher instance. For example, a Network Watcher enabled in the East US region is namedNetworkWatcher_eastus.
The Network Watcher instance is created in a resource group namedNetworkWatcherRG. The resource group is created if it doesn't already exist.
If you wish to customize the name of a Network Watcher instance and resource group, you can usePowerShellorREST APImethods. In each option, the resource group must exist before you create a Network Watcher in it.
Create a Network Watcher instance usingNew-AzNetworkWatchercmdlet:
# Create a resource group for the Network Watcher instance (if it doesn't already exist).
New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'NetworkWatcherRG' -Location 'eastus'

# Create an instance of Network Watcher in East US region.
New-AzNetworkWatcher -Name 'NetworkWatcher_eastus' -ResourceGroupName 'NetworkWatcherRG' -Location 'eastus'
# Create a resource group for the Network Watcher instance (if it doesn't already exist).
New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'NetworkWatcherRG' -Location 'eastus'

# Create an instance of Network Watcher in East US region.
New-AzNetworkWatcher -Name 'NetworkWatcher_eastus' -ResourceGroupName 'NetworkWatcherRG' -Location 'eastus'
Note
When you create a Network Watcher instance using PowerShell, you can customize the name of a Network Watcher instance and resource group. However, the resource group must exist before you create a Network Watcher instance in it.
Create a Network Watcher instance usingaz network watcher configurecommand:
# Create a resource group for the Network Watcher instance (if it doesn't already exist).
az group create --name 'NetworkWatcherRG' --location 'eastus'

# Create an instance of Network Watcher in East US region.
az network watcher configure --resource-group 'NetworkWatcherRG' --locations 'eastus' --enabled
# Create a resource group for the Network Watcher instance (if it doesn't already exist).
az group create --name 'NetworkWatcherRG' --location 'eastus'

# Create an instance of Network Watcher in East US region.
az network watcher configure --resource-group 'NetworkWatcherRG' --locations 'eastus' --enabled
Note
When you create a Network Watcher instance using the Azure CLI:
The name of the Network Watcher instance is automatically set toregion-watcher, whereregioncorresponds to the Azure region of the Network Watcher instance. For example, a Network Watcher enabled in the East US region is namedeastus-watcher.
You can customize the name of the Network Watcher resource group. However, the resource group must exist before you create a Network Watcher instance in it.
If you wish to customize the name of the Network Watcher instance, you can usePowerShellorREST APImethods.
Disable Network Watcher for your region
You can disable Network Watcher for a region by deleting the Network Watcher instance in that region. You can delete a Network Watcher instance using theAzure portal,PowerShell, theAzure CLI, orREST API.
Warning
Deleting a Network Watcher instance deletes all Network Watcher running operations, historical data, and alerts with no option to revert. For example, if you deleteNetworkWatcher_eastusinstance, all flow logs, connection monitors and packet captures in East US region will be deleted.

Remove-AzNetworkWatcher -Location 'eastus'
# Disable Network Watcher in the East US region by deleting its East US instance.
Remove-AzNetworkWatcher -Location 'eastus'
Useaz network watcher configureto delete an instance of Network Watcher:
# Disable Network Watcher in the East US region.
az network watcher configure --locations 'eastus' --enabled 'false'

az network watcher configure --locations 'eastus' --enabled 'false'
Opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement
You can opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.
Caution
Opting-out of Network Watcher automatic enablement is a permanent change. Once you opt out, you cannot opt in without contactingAzure support.
