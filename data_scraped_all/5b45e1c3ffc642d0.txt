This article helps you view Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost in Microsoft Cost management. You use the following views to analyze your Kubernetes costs, which are available at the subscription scope.
Kubernetes clustersâ Shows aggregated costs of clusters in a subscription.
Kubernetes namespacesâ Shows aggregated costs of namespaces for all clusters in a subscription.
Kubernetes assetsâ Shows costs of assets running within a cluster.
Visibility into a Kubernetes cluster cost helps you identify opportunities for optimization. It also enables cost allocation to different teams running their applications on shared clusters in different namespaces.
Prerequisites
You must enable AKS cost analysis on the cluster to view its costs. If you have multiple clusters running in a subscription, you must enable AKS cost analysis on every cluster. For more information about how to enable cost analysis for clusters, seeAzure Kubernetes Service cost analysis.
Kubernetes cost views are available only for the following subscription agreement types:Enterprise AgreementMicrosoft Customer AgreementOther agreement types aren't supported.

View from the Cost Management page
To view AKS costs from the Cost Management page:
Sign in toAzure portaland search forCost analysis.
Verify that you are at the correct scope. If necessary, selectchangeto select the correct subscription scope that hosts your Kubernetes clusters.
Select theAll viewstab, then under Customizable views, select a view underKubernetes views.
Kubernetes clusters view
The Kubernetes clusters view shows the costs of all clusters in a subscription. With this view, you can drill down into namespaces or assets for a cluster. Select theellipsis(â¦) to see the other views.

Kubernetes namespaces view
The Kubernetes namespaces view shows the costs of namespaces for the cluster along with Idle and System charges. Service charges, which represent the charges for Uptime SLA, are also shown.

Kubernetes assets view
The Kubernetes assets view shows the costs of assets in a cluster categorized under one of the service categories: Compute, Networking, and Storage. The uptime SLA charges are under the Service category.

View amortized costs
By default, all Kubernetes views show actual costs. You can view amortized costs by selectingCustomizeat the top of the view and then selectAmortize reservation and savings plan purchases.
