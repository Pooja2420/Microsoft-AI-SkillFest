When creating an ExpressRoute virtual network gateway, you must select agateway SKU. Higher-level SKUs allocate more CPUs and network bandwidth, enabling the gateway to support higher throughput and more reliable connections to the virtual network.
Prerequisites
Review thegateway migrationarticle before starting.
Ensure you have an existingExpressRoute virtual network gatewayin your Azure subscription.
Tip
You can now deploy two ExpressRoute gateways within the same virtual network. To do this, create a second ExpressRoute gateway with its admin state set todisabled. Once the second gateway is deployed, initiate thePreparestep in the migration tool. This step will establish the connection without redeploying the gateway, as it is already in place. Finally, run theMigratestep, which will change the new gateway's admin state toenabled, completing the migration process. This method minimizes the migration or maintenance window, significantly reducing downtime when transitioning from a non-zonal to a zone-redundant gateway.
Steps to migrate to a new gateway in Azure portal
Follow these steps to migrate to a new gateway using the Azure portal:
Navigate to yourVirtual Network Gatewayresource in theAzure portal.
Navigate to yourVirtual Network Gatewayresource in theAzure portal.
In the left-hand menu underSettings, selectGateway SKU Migration.
In the left-hand menu underSettings, selectGateway SKU Migration.
SelectValidateto check if the gateway is ready for migration. A list of prerequisites will be displayed. If any prerequisites are unmet, validation fails, and migration can't proceed.

Once validation succeeds, proceed to thePreparestage. A new virtual network gateway is created. UnderVirtual Network Gateway Details, provide the following information:SettingvalueGateway nameEnter a name for the new gateway.Gateway SKUSelect the SKU for the new gateway.Public IP addressSelectAdd new, provide a name for the new public IP, choose an availability zone, and selectOK.NoteDuring this process, your existing virtual network gateway is locked, preventing the creation or modification of connections.

After the new gateway is created, proceed to theMigratestage. Select the new gateway (for example,myERGateway_migrated) to transfer settings from the old gateway to the new one. All network traffic and data path connections transfer without interruptions. SelectMigrate Trafficto start the process. This step can take up to 5 minutes.

Once traffic migration is complete, proceed to theCommitstage. Finalize the migration by deleting the old gateway. SelectCommit Migrationto complete this step without downtime.

Important
Before committing, verify that the new virtual network gateway has a working ExpressRoute connection and confirm traffic is flowing through the new connection.
Expect a possible interruption of up to 3 minutes during migration.
Once committed, the connection name can't be changed. To rename the connection, it must be deleted and recreated. Contact Azure support for assistance if needed.
