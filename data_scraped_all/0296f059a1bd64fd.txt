This article shows you how to create ExpressRoute Direct using the Azure portal. ExpressRoute Direct allows you to connect directly to Microsoft's global network at strategically distributed peering locations worldwide. For more information, seeAbout ExpressRoute Direct.
Before you begin
Before using ExpressRoute Direct, you must enroll your subscription. To enroll, register theAllow ExpressRoute Directfeature to your subscription:
Sign in to the Azure portal and select the subscription you wish to enroll.

Complete the fields on theConfigurationpage.Peering Location: The peering location where you connect to the ExpressRoute Direct resource. For more information about peering locations, reviewExpressRoute Locations.Bandwidth: The port pair bandwidth that you want to reserve. ExpressRoute Direct supports both 10 Gb and 100-Gb bandwidth options. If your desired bandwidth isn't available at the specified peering location,open a Support Request in the Azure portal.Encapsulation: ExpressRoute Direct supports both QinQ and Dot1Q encapsulation.If QinQ is selected, each ExpressRoute circuit is dynamically assigned an S-Tag and is unique throughout the ExpressRoute Direct resource.Each C-Tag on the circuit must be unique on the circuit, but not across the ExpressRoute Direct.If Dot1Q encapsulation is selected, you must manage the uniqueness of the C-Tag (VLAN) across the entire ExpressRoute Direct resource.ImportantExpressRoute Direct can only be one encapsulation type. Encapsulation can't be changed after ExpressRoute Direct creation.

Create a circuit
By default, you can create 10 circuits in the subscription where the ExpressRoute Direct resource is. You can increase this number by contacting support. You're responsible for tracking both Provisioned and Utilized Bandwidth. Provisioned bandwidth is the sum of bandwidth of all circuits on the ExpressRoute Direct resource. Utilized bandwidth is the physical usage of the underlying physical interfaces.
There are more circuit bandwidths that can be utilized on ExpressRoute Direct only to support the scenarios outlined. These bandwidths are: 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps.
SkuTiercan be Local, Standard, or Premium.

SkuFamilymust be MeteredData only. Unlimited isn't supported on ExpressRoute Direct.

The following steps help you create an ExpressRoute circuit from the ExpressRoute Direct workflow. If you prefer, you can also create a circuit using the regular circuit workflow, although there's no advantage in using the regular circuit workflow steps for this configuration. For more information, seeCreate and modify an ExpressRoute circuit.
From the ExpressRoute Direct resource, selectCircuitsunderSettingsin the left side menu, and then select+ Add.
