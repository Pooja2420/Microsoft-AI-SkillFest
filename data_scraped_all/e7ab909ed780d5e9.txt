Feature benefits
The SQL Server IaaS Agent extension unlocks a number of feature benefits for managing your SQL Server VM, letting you pick and choose which benefit suits your business needs. When you first register with the extension, the functionality is limited to a few features that don't rely on the SQL IaaS Agent. Once you enable a feature that requires it, the agent is installed to the SQL Server VM.
The following table details the benefits available through the SQL IaaS Agent extension, and whether or not the agent is required:
Permissions models
By default, the SQL IaaS Agent extension uses the least privilege mode permission model. The least privilege permission model grants the minimum permissions required for each feature that you enable. Each feature that you use is assigned a custom role in SQL Server, and the custom role is only granted permissions that are required to perform actions related to the feature.
The following table defines the SQL Server permissions and custom roles used by each feature of the extension:
db_ddladmin
master
db_backupoperator
msdb
SqlIaaSExtension_AutoBackup
sysadmin

NT SERVICE\AzureWLBackupPluginSvc
SqlIaaSExtension_CredentialMgmt
SqlIaaSExtension_ThrottlingAssessment
SqlIaaSExtension_Assessment
SqlIaaSExtension_SqlInstanceSetting
SqlIaaSExtension_StorageConfig
SqlIaaSExtension_StatusReporting
SQL Server VMs deployed prior to October 2022 use the oldersysadminmodel where the SQL IaaS Agent extension takessysadminrights by default. For SQL Server VMsprovisioned before October 2022, you can enable the least privilege permissions model manually.
sysadmin
sysadmin
Note
The option to enable least privilege mode isonly availablefor SQL Server VMs provisionedbefore October 2022. If this option is not visible in your environment, it's because your SQL Server VM already has least privilege mode enabled by default.
To enable the least privilege permissions model, go to yourSQL virtual machines resource, chooseSecurity ConfigurationunderSecurityand then check the box next toEnable least privilege mode:

Installation
When you register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension, binaries are copied to the VM. Once you enable a feature that relies on it, the SQL IaaS Agent extension is installed to the VM and has access to SQL Server. By default, the agent follows the model of least privilege, and only has permissions within SQL Server that are associated with the features that you enable - unless you manually installed SQL Server to the VM yourself, or deployed a SQL Server image from the marketplace prior to October 2022, in which case the agent has sysadmin rights within SQL Server.
Deploying a SQL Server VM Azure Marketplace image through the Azure portal automatically registers the SQL Server VM with the extension. However, if you choose to self-install SQL Server on an Azure virtual machine, or provision an Azure virtual machine from a custom VHD, then you must register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension to unlock feature benefits. By default, self-installed Azure VMs with SQL Server 2016 or later are automatically registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension when detected by theCEIP service. SQL Server VMs not detected by the CEIP should be manually registered.
When you register with the SQL IaaS Agent extension, binaries are copied to the virtual machine, but the agent isn't installed by default. The agent will only be installed when you enable one of theSQL IaaS Agent extension featuresthat require it, and the following two services will then run on the virtual machine:
Microsoft SQL Server IaaS agentis the main service for the SQL IaaS Agent extension and should run under theLocal Systemaccount.
Microsoft SQL Server IaaS Query Serviceis a helper service that helps the extension run queries within SQL Server and should run under theNT ServiceaccountNT Service\SqlIaaSExtensionQuery.
NT Service\SqlIaaSExtensionQuery
There are three ways to register with the extension:
Automatically for all current and future VMs in a subscription
Manually for a single VM
Manually for multiple VMs in bulk
Registering your SQL Server VM with the SQL Server IaaS Agent extension creates theSQL virtual machineresourcewithin your subscription, which is aseparateresource from the virtual machine resource. Deleting the extension from your SQL Server VM removes theSQL virtual machineresourcefrom your subscription but doesn't drop the underlying virtual machine.
Multiple instance support
The SQL IaaS Agent extension supports the following environments:
One default instance.
If there are multiple instances, only the default instance is supported and managed by the extension in the Azure portal. Environments with multiple named instances without a default instance aren't supported.
One named instance, if it's the only installed instance.
Named instance support
If you want to manage a single named instance in the Azure portal, install SQL Server with a nondefault name to an Azure virtual machine and thenregister it with the SQL IaaS Agent extension.
If you want to manage a single named instance in a SQL Server image from Azure Marketplace, you must first uninstall the existing SQL Server instance, install SQL Server with a named instance, and then register it with the SQL IaaS Agent extension.
To use a single named instance with SQL Server on Azure VMs, follow these steps:
Deploy a SQL Server VM from Azure Marketplace.
Delete the SQL IaaS Agent extension from the SQL Server VM.
Connect to the virtual machine and uninstall SQL Server completely.
Restart the virtual machine.
Connect to the virtual machine and then use the setup media (typically located inC:\SQLServerFull) to install anamed SQL Server instance.
C:\SQLServerFull
Restart the virtual machine.
Register the VM with the SQL IaaS Agent Extension.
Failover Clustered Instance support
Registering your SQL Server Failover Clustered Instance (FCI) is supported with limited functionality. Due to the limited functionality, SQL Server FCIs registered with the extension don't support features that require the agent, such as automated backup, patching, Microsoft Entra authentication and advanced portal management.
If your SQL Server VM has already been registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension and you've enabled any features that require the agent, you'll need todelete the extension from the SQL Server VMand register it again after your FCI is installed.
Verify status of extension
Use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI to check the status of the extension.
Azure portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Verify the extension is installed in the Azure portal.
Go to yourVirtual machineresource in the Azure portal (not theSQL virtual machinesresource, but the resource for your VM). SelectExtensionsunderSettings.  You should see theSqlIaasExtensionextension listed, as in the following example:

You can also use theGet-AzVMSqlServerExtensionAzure PowerShell cmdlet:
Get-AzVMSqlServerExtension -VMName "vmname" -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname"
Get-AzVMSqlServerExtension -VMName "vmname" -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname"
The previous command confirms that the agent is installed and provides general status information. You can get specific status information about automated backup and patching by using the following commands:
$sqlext = Get-AzVMSqlServerExtension -VMName "vmname" -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname"
 $sqlext.AutoPatchingSettings
 $sqlext.AutoBackupSettings
$sqlext = Get-AzVMSqlServerExtension -VMName "vmname" -ResourceGroupName "resourcegroupname"
 $sqlext.AutoPatchingSettings
 $sqlext.AutoBackupSettings
It's not currently possible to check the status of the extension by using the Azure CLI.
Management modes
Before March 2023, the SQL IaaS Agent extension relied on management modes to define the security model, and unlock feature benefits. In March 2023, the extension architecture was updated to remove management modes entirely, instead relying on the principle of least privilege to give customers control over how they want to use the extension on a feature-by-feature basis.
Starting in March 2023, when you first register with the extension, binaries are saved to your virtual machine to provide you with basic functionality such as license management. Once you enable any feature that relies on the agent, the binaries are used to install the SQL IaaS Agent to your virtual machine, andpermissionsare assigned to the SQL IaaS Agent service as needed by each feature that you enable.
Limitations
The SQL IaaS Agent extension only supports:
SQL Server VMs deployed through the Azure Resource Manager. SQL Server VMs deployed through the classic model aren't supported.
SQL Server VMs deployed to the public cloud, Azure Government cloud, and 21Vianet (Azure in China). Deployments to other private or government clouds aren't supported.
TCP/IP must be enabled in SQL Server Configuration Manager and for the VM for the extension to work with your SQL Server on Azure VMs.
SQL Server FCIs with limited functionality. SQL Server FCIs registered with the extension don't support features that require the agent, such as automated backup, patching, and advanced portal management.
VMs with a default instance, or a single named instance when no default instance is present.
If the VM has multiple named instances, then one of the instances must be the default instance to work with the SQL IaaS Agent extension.
SQL Server instance images only. The SQL IaaS Agent extension doesn't support Reporting Services or Analysis services, such as the following images: SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server, SQL Server Analysis Services.
