In this quickstart, you create and activate an Azure Key Vault Managed HSM (Hardware Security Module) with PowerShell. Managed HSM is a fully managed, highly available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service that enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys for your cloud applications, usingFIPS 140-2 Level 3validated HSMs. For more information on Managed HSM, you may review theOverview.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
If you choose to use Azure PowerShell locally:Install the latest version of the Az PowerShell module.Connect to your Azure account using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet.
Install the latest version of the Az PowerShell module.
Connect to your Azure account using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet.
If you choose to use Azure Cloud Shell:SeeOverview of Azure Cloud Shellfor more information.
SeeOverview of Azure Cloud Shellfor more information.
Create a resource group
A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Use the Azure PowerShellNew-AzResourceGroupcmdlet to create a resource group namedmyResourceGroupin thenorwayeastlocation.
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "norwayeast"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "norwayeast"
Get your principal ID
To create a Managed HSM, you need your Microsoft Entra principal ID.  To obtain your ID, use the Azure PowerShellGet-AzADUsercmdlet, passing your email address to the "UserPrincipalName" parameter:
Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName "<your@email.address>"
Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName "<your@email.address>"
Your principal ID is returned in the format, "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx".
Create a Managed HSM
Creating a Managed HSM is a two-step process:
Provision a Managed HSM resource.
Activate your Managed HSM by downloading an artifact called thesecurity domain.
Provision a Managed HSM
Use the Azure PowerShellNew-AzKeyVaultManagedHsmcmdlet to create a new Managed HSM. You need to provide some information:
Managed HSM name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)ImportantEach Managed HSM must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-managed-hsm-name> with the name of your Managed HSM in the following examples.
Managed HSM name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)
Important
Each Managed HSM must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-managed-hsm-name> with the name of your Managed HSM in the following examples.
Resource group name:myResourceGroup.
Resource group name:myResourceGroup.
The location:Norway East.
The location:Norway East.
Your principal ID: Pass the Microsoft Entra principal ID that you obtained in the last section to the "Administrator" parameter.
Your principal ID: Pass the Microsoft Entra principal ID that you obtained in the last section to the "Administrator" parameter.
New-AzKeyVaultManagedHsm -Name "your-unique-managed-hsm-name" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "norwayeast" -Administrator "your-principal-ID" -SoftDeleteRetentionInDays "# of days to retain the managed hsm after softdelete"
New-AzKeyVaultManagedHsm -Name "your-unique-managed-hsm-name" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "norwayeast" -Administrator "your-principal-ID" -SoftDeleteRetentionInDays "# of days to retain the managed hsm after softdelete"
Note
The create command can take a few minutes. Once it returns successfully you are ready to activate your HSM.
The output of this cmdlet shows properties of the newly created Managed HSM. Take note of these two properties:
Name: The name you provided for the Managed HSM.
HsmUri: In the example, the HsmUri is https://<your-unique-managed-hsm-name>.managedhsm.azure.net/. Applications that use your vault through its REST API must use this URI.
At this point, your Azure account is the only one authorized to perform any operations on this new HSM.
Activate your Managed HSM
All data plane commands are disabled until the HSM is activated. You will not be able to create keys or assign roles. Only the designated administrators that were assigned during the create command can activate the HSM. To activate the HSM, you must download theSecurity Domain.
To activate your HSM, you will need:
To provide a minimum of three RSA key-pairs (up to a maximum of 10)
To specify the minimum number of keys required to decrypt the security domain (called aquorum)
To activate the HSM, you send at least three (maximum 10) RSA public keys to the HSM. The HSM encrypts the security domain with these keys and sends it back. Once this security domain download is successfully completed, your HSM is ready to use. You also need to specify quorum, which is the minimum number of private keys required to decrypt the security domain.
The following example shows how to useopenssl(available for Windowshere) to generate three self-signed certificates.
openssl
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_0.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_0.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_1.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_1.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_2.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_2.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_0.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_0.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_1.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_1.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_2.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_2.cer
Note
Even if the certificate has "expired," it can still be used to restore the security domain.
Important
Create and store the RSA key pairs and security domain file generated in this step securely.
Use the Azure PowerShellExport-AzKeyVaultSecurityDomaincmdlet to download the security domain and activate your Managed HSM. The following example uses three RSA key pairs (only public keys are needed for this command) and sets the quorum to two.
Export-AzKeyVaultSecurityDomain -Name "<your-unique-managed-hsm-name>" -Certificates "cert_0.cer", "cert_1.cer", "cert_2.cer" -OutputPath "MHSMsd.ps.json" -Quorum 2
Export-AzKeyVaultSecurityDomain -Name "<your-unique-managed-hsm-name>" -Certificates "cert_0.cer", "cert_1.cer", "cert_2.cer" -OutputPath "MHSMsd.ps.json" -Quorum 2
Please store the security domain file and the RSA key pairs securely. You will need them for disaster recovery or for creating another Managed HSM that shares same security domain so the two can share keys.
After successfully downloading the security domain, your HSM will be in an active state and ready for you to use.
Clean up resources
Other quickstarts and tutorials in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with other quickstarts and tutorials, you may want to leave these resources in place.
When no longer needed, you can use the Azure PowerShellRemove-AzResourceGroupcmdlet to remove the resource group and all related resources.
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup"
Warning
Deleting the resource group puts the Managed HSM into a soft-deleted state. The Managed HSM will continue to be billed until it is purged. SeeManaged HSM soft-delete and purge protection
