Protect your resource hierarchy

Your resources, resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tenant compose
your resource hierarchy. Settings at the root management group, such as Azure custom roles or
policy assignments, can affect every resource in your resource hierarchy. It's important to
protect the resource hierarchy from changes that could negatively affect all resources.
Management groups have hierarchy settings that enable the tenant administrator to control these
behaviors. This article covers each of the available hierarchy settings and how to set them.
Azure RBAC permissions for hierarchy settings
Configuring hierarchy settings requires the following resource provider operations on
the root management group:
Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/settings/write
Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/settings/write
Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/settings/read
Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/settings/read
These operations represent Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions.
They only allow a user to read and update the hierarchy settings. They don't
provide any other access to the management group hierarchy or to resources in the hierarchy.
Both of
these operations are available in the Azure built-in role Hierarchy Settings Administrator.
Setting: Define the default management group
By default, a new subscription that you add in a tenant becomes a member of the root management
group. If you assign policy assignments, Azure RBAC, and other governance
constructs to the root management group, they immediately affect these new
subscriptions. For this reason, many organizations don't apply these constructs at the root
management group, even though that's the desired place to assign them. In other cases, an organization wants a more
restrictive set of controls for new subscriptions but doesn't want to assign them to all
subscriptions. This setting supports both use cases.
By allowing the default management group for new subscriptions to be defined, you can apply organization-wide
governance constructs at the root management group. You can define a separate management group
with policy assignments or Azure role assignments that are more suited to a new subscription.

Define the default management group by using the REST API
To define the default management group by using the REST API, you must call theHierarchy Settingsendpoint. Use
the following REST API URI and body format. Replace{rootMgID}with the ID of your root management
group. Replace{defaultGroupID}with the ID of the management group that will become the default management
group.
{rootMgID}
{defaultGroupID}
REST API URI:PUT https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{rootMgID}/settings/default?api-version=2020-05-01
REST API URI:

}
{
    "properties": {
        "defaultManagementGroup": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{defaultGroupID}"
    }
}
To set the default management group back to the root management group, use the same endpoint and setdefaultManagementGroupto a value of/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{rootMgID}.
defaultManagementGroup
/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{rootMgID}
Setting: Require authorization
Any user, by default, can create new management groups in a tenant. Admins of a tenant might want
to provide these permissions only to specific users, to maintain consistency and conformity in the
management group hierarchy. To create child management groups, a user requires theMicrosoft.Management/managementGroups/writeoperation on the root management group.
Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/write

Require authorization by using the REST API
To require authorization by using the REST API, call theHierarchy Settingsendpoint. Use
the following REST API URI and body format. This value is a Boolean, so provide eithertrueorfalsefor the value. A value oftrueenables this method of protecting your management group
hierarchy.
true
false

Azure PowerShell sample
Azure PowerShell doesn't have anAzcommand to define the default management group or to require
authorization. As a workaround, you can use the REST API with the following Azure PowerShell sample:
Az
$root_management_group_id = "Enter the ID of root management group"
$default_management_group_id = "Enter the ID of default management group (or use the same ID of the root management group)"

$body = '{
     "properties": {
          "defaultManagementGroup": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/' + $default_management_group_id + '",
          "requireAuthorizationForGroupCreation": true
     }
}'

$token = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
$headers = @{"Authorization"= "Bearer $token"; "Content-Type"= "application/json"}
$uri = "https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/$root_management_group_id/settings/default?api-version=2020-05-01"

Invoke-RestMethod -Method PUT -Uri $uri -Headers $headers -Body $body
$root_management_group_id = "Enter the ID of root management group"
$default_management_group_id = "Enter the ID of default management group (or use the same ID of the root management group)"

$body = '{
     "properties": {
          "defaultManagementGroup": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/' + $default_management_group_id + '",
          "requireAuthorizationForGroupCreation": true
     }
}'

$token = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
$headers = @{"Authorization"= "Bearer $token"; "Content-Type"= "application/json"}
$uri = "https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/$root_management_group_id/settings/default?api-version=2020-05-01"

Invoke-RestMethod -Method PUT -Uri $uri -Headers $headers -Body $body
