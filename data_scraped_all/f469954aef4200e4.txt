This article describes the requirements and considerations you need to be aware of before usinglarge volumeson Azure NetApp Files.
Requirements and considerations
The following requirements and considerations apply to large volumes. For performance considerations ofregular volumes, seePerformance considerations for Azure NetApp Files.
A regular volume canât be converted to a large volume.

You must create a large volume at a size of 50 TiB or larger. The maximum size of a large volume is 1,024 TiB, though 2-PiB large volumes are available on request depending on regional dedicated capacity availability. To request 2-PiB large volumes, contact your account team.

You can't resize a large volume to less than 50 TiB.
A large volume cannot be resized to more than 30% of its lowest provisioned size. This limit is adjustable viaa support request. When requesting the resize, specify the desired size in TiB.

You can't create a large volume with application volume groups.
You can't create a large volume with application volume groups.
Currently, large volumes aren't suited for database (HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.) data and log volumes. For database workloads requiring more than a single volumeâs throughput limit, consider deploying multiple regular volumes. To optimize multiple volume deployments for databases, useapplication volume groups.

Throughput ceilings for all the Standard, Premium, and Ultra service levels with large volumes is 12,800 MiB/s. You're able to grow to 1 PiB with the throughput ceiling per the following table:CapacityLinear performance scaling per TiB up to maximum 12,800 MiB/sCapacity tierMinimum volume size(TiB)Maximum volume size (TiB)Minimum throughput for capacity tier (MiB/s)Maximum throughput for capacity tier (MiB/s)Standard (16 MiB/s per TiB)501,02480012,800Premium (64 MiB/s per TiB)501,0243,20012,800Ultra (128 MiB/s per TiB)501,0246,40012,800* 2-PiB large volumes are available on request depending on regional dedicated capacity availability.

About 64-bit file IDs
Whereas regular volumes use 32-bit file IDs, large volumes employ 64-bit file IDs. File IDs are unique identifiers that allow Azure NetApp Files to keep track of files in the file system. 64-bit IDs are utilized to increase the number of files allowed in a single volume, enabling a large volume able to hold more files than a regular volume.

Configure large volumes
Important
Before you can use large volumes, you must first requestan increase in regional capacity quota.
Once yourregional capacity quotahas increased, you can create volumes that are up to 1 PiB in size. When creating a volume, after you designate the volume quota, you must selectYesfor theLarge volumefield. Once created, you can manage your large volumes in the same manner as regular volumes.
Register the feature
If this is your first time using large volumes, register the feature with thelarge volumes sign-up form.
Check the status of the feature registration:
Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFLargeVolumes
Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFLargeVolumes
You can also useAzure CLI commandaz feature showto register the feature and display the registration status.
