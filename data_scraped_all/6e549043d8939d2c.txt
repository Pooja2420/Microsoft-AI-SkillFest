Azure AI services data loss prevention capabilities allow customers to configure the list of outbound URLs their Azure AI services resources are allowed to access. This creates another level of control for customers to prevent data loss. In this article, we'll cover the steps required to enable the data loss prevention feature for Azure AI services resources.
Prerequisites
Before you make a request, you need an Azure account and an Azure AI services subscription. If you already have an account, go ahead and skip to the next section. If you don't have an account, we have a guide to get you set up in minutes:Create an Azure AI services multi-service resource.
Enabling data loss prevention
There are two parts to enable data loss prevention. First, the resource propertyrestrictOutboundNetworkAccessmust be set totrue. When this is set to true, you also need to provide the list of approved URLs. The list of URLs is added to theallowedFqdnListproperty. TheallowedFqdnListproperty contains an array of comma-separated URLs.
restrictOutboundNetworkAccess
true
allowedFqdnList
allowedFqdnList
Note
TheallowedFqdnListproperty value supports a maximum of 1000 URLs.
allowedFqdnList
The property supports both IP addresses (IPv4 only) and fully qualified domain names (i.e.,www.microsoft.com) as values.
www.microsoft.com
It can take up to 15 minutes for the updated list to take effect.
