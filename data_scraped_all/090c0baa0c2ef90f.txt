This article provides instructions on how to recover or purge an Azure AI services resource that is already deleted.
Once you delete a resource, you can't create another one with the same name for 48 hours. To create a resource with the same name, you need to purge the deleted resource.
Note
The instructions in this article are applicable to both a multi-service resource and a single-service resource. A multi-service resource enables access to multiple Azure AI services using a single key and endpoint. On the other hand, a single-service resource enables access to just that specific Azure AI service for which the resource was created.

Charges for provisioned deployments on a deleted resource continue until the resource is purged. To prevent unnecessary charges, delete a resource's deployment before deleting the resource.

Recover a deleted resource
The following prerequisites must be met before you can recover a deleted resource:
The resource to be recovered must be deleted within the past 48 hours.
The resource to be recovered must not be purged already. A purged resource can't be recovered.
Before you attempt to recover a deleted resource, make sure that the resource group for that account exists. If the resource group was deleted, you must recreate it. Recovering a resource group isn't possible. For more information, seeâ¯Manage resource groups.
If the deleted resource used customer-managed keys with Azure Key Vault and the key vault is also deleted, then you must restore the key vault before you restore the Azure AI services resource. For more information, seeAzure Key Vault recovery management.
If the deleted resource used a customer-managed storage and storage account is also deleted, you must restore the storage account before you restore the Azure AI services resource. For instructions, seeRecover a deleted storage account.
To recover a deleted Azure AI services resource, use the following commands. Where applicable, replace:
{subscriptionID}with your Azure subscription ID
{subscriptionID}
{resourceGroup}with your resource group
{resourceGroup}
{resourceName}with your resource name
{resourceName}
{location}with the location of your resource
{location}
Azure portal
Rest API
PowerShell
Azure CLI
If you need to recover a deleted resource, navigate to the hub of the Azure AI services API type and select "Manage deleted resources" from the menu. For example, if you would like to recover an "Anomaly detector" resource, search for "Anomaly detector" in the search bar and select the service. Then selectManage deleted resources.
To locate the deleted resource you would like to recover, select the subscription in the dropdown list. Select one or more of the deleted resources and selectRecover.

Note
It can take a couple of minutes for your deleted resource to recover and show up in the list of the resources. Select theRefreshbutton in the menu to update the list of resources.
Use the followingPUTcommand:
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resourceName}?Api-Version=2021-04-30
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resourceName}?Api-Version=2021-04-30
In the request body, use the following JSON format:
{ 
  "location": "{location}", 
   "properties": { 
        "restore": true 
    } 
}
{ 
  "location": "{location}", 
   "properties": { 
        "restore": true 
    } 
}
Use the following command to restore the resource:
New-AzResource -Location {location} -Properties @{restore=$true} -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resourceName}   -ApiVersion 2021-04-30
New-AzResource -Location {location} -Properties @{restore=$true} -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resourceName}   -ApiVersion 2021-04-30
If you need to find the name of your deleted resources, you can get a list of deleted resource names with the following command:
Get-AzResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/deletedAccounts -ApiVersion 2021-04-30
Get-AzResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/deletedAccounts -ApiVersion 2021-04-30
az resource create --subscription {subscriptionID} -g {resourceGroup} -n {resourceName} --location {location} --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices --resource-type accounts --properties "{\"restore\": true}"
az resource create --subscription {subscriptionID} -g {resourceGroup} -n {resourceName} --location {location} --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices --resource-type accounts --properties "{\"restore\": true}"
Purge a deleted resource
Your subscription must haveMicrosoft.CognitiveServices/locations/resourceGroups/deletedAccounts/deletepermissions to purge resources, such asCognitive Services ContributororContributor.
Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/resourceGroups/deletedAccounts/delete
When usingContributorto purge a resource the role must be assigned at the subscription level. If the role assignment is only present at the resource or resource group level, you can't access the purge functionality.
Contributor
To purge a deleted Azure AI services resource, use the following commands. Where applicable, replace:
{subscriptionID}with your Azure subscription ID
{subscriptionID}
{resourceGroup}with your resource group
{resourceGroup}
{resourceName}with your resource name
{resourceName}
{location}with the location of your resource
{location}
Note
Once a resource is purged, it's permanently deleted and can't be restored. You lose all data and keys associated with the resource.
