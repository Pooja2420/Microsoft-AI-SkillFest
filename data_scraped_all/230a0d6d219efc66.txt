Inputs
notifyUsers-Notify usersstring. Required.
notifyUsers
string
Send a manual validation pending email to a comma separated list of specific users (or groups). You can send an email to a group using the[org name]\groupname syntax. If you can edit the pipeline, you have permission to add email addresses to notifyUsers. No additional permissions are required.
[org name]\group
This task input is required, but you can specify an empty string if you don't want to notify anyone, for example during a test run:notifyUsers: ''.
notifyUsers: ''
approvers-Approversstring.
approvers
string
Specify a comma separated list of users/groups/project teams to act on a manual validation. In absence of input, users with queue build permission will be able to take action.
allowApproversToApproveTheirOwnRuns-Allow approvers to approve their own runboolean. Default value:true.
allowApproversToApproveTheirOwnRuns
boolean
true
If this is true, approver will be able to approve their own run.
instructions-Instructionsstring.
instructions
string
Specifies the instructions that are shown to the user when resuming or rejecting the manual validation. Based on these instructions, the user will make an informed decision about this manual validation.
onTimeout-On timeoutstring. Allowed values:reject,resume. Default value:reject.
onTimeout
string
reject
resume
reject
Automatically rejects or resumes this manual validation after it is pending for the specified timeout, or 30 days, whichever is earlier.
Task control options
All tasks have control options in addition to their task inputs. For more information, seeControl options and common task properties.
Output variables
None.
Remarks
Use this task in a YAML pipeline to pause a run within a stage. This is typically executed to perform various manual steps or actions and then the run is resumed or rejected.
Important
This task is only supported in YAML pipelines and can only be used in anagentless jobof a YAML pipeline.
TheManual Validationtask allows you to pause a pipeline run within a stage, typically to perform some manual steps or actions, and then continue with the pipeline. For example, the user may need to manually validate certain deployment configurations before the pipeline starts a long running computational intensive job.
TheManual Validationtask configuration includes aninstructionsparameter that is used to provide related information or to specify the manual steps the user executes during the pause. You can configure the task to send email notifications to users and user groups when it is awaiting a review and specify the automatic response (reject or resume) after a configurable timeout occurs.
You can specify the timeout value for the task using the optionaltimeoutInMinutesparameter, available in thecommon task properties.
timeoutInMinutes
Note
For the task to run completely, thetimeoutInMinutesvalue of the job (default = 60 minutes) containing this task should be higher than thetimeoutInMinutesvalue of the task itself. Seedefault job timeout values.
timeoutInMinutes
default = 60 minutes
timeoutInMinutes
Tip
You can use variables to specify email addresses in thenotifyUsersparameter.
notifyUsers
When the Manual Validation task is activated during a pipeline, it displays
a message bar with a link that opens the Manual validation dialog, which contains the instructions. After carrying out the manual steps, the administrator or user can choose to resume the run or reject it. Users withQueue buildspermission on the pipeline can resume or reject the run.
Examples
jobs:
  - job: waitForValidation
    displayName: Wait for external validation
    pool: server
    timeoutInMinutes: 4320 # job times out in 3 days
    steps:
    - task: ManualValidation@1
      timeoutInMinutes: 1440 # task times out in 1 day
      inputs:
        notifyUsers: |
          test@test.com,
          example@example.com
        instructions: 'Please validate the build configuration and resume'
        onTimeout: 'resume'
