Kudu is the engine behind some features inAzure App Servicethat are related to source-control-based deployment and other deployment methods, like Dropbox and OneDrive sync.
Access Kudu for your app
Anytime you create an app, App Service creates a companion app for it that's secured by HTTPS. This Kudu app is accessible at these URLs:
App not in the Isolated tier:https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net
https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net
Internet-facing app in the Isolated tier (App Service Environment):https://<app-name>.scm.<ase-name>.p.azurewebsites.net
https://<app-name>.scm.<ase-name>.p.azurewebsites.net
Internal app in the Isolated tier (App Service Environment for internal load balancing):https://<app-name>.scm.<ase-name>.appserviceenvironment.net
https://<app-name>.scm.<ase-name>.appserviceenvironment.net

RBAC permissions required to access Kudu
To access Kudu in the browser by using Microsoft Entra authentication, you need to be assigned an appropriate built-in or custom role over the scope of the application. The assigned role must include permission for theMicrosoft.Web/sites/publish/Actionresource provider operation. The following table shows example built-in roles that include this permission.
Microsoft.Web/sites/publish/Action
1Privileged administrator roles grant much more permission than is needed to access Kudu. If need to create a new role assignment, consider if a job function role with less access can be used instead.
See therole-based access control overviewto learn more about creating role assignments.
