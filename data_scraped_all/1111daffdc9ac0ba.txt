When you monitor your Azure Logic Apps resources inMicrosoft Azure Security Center, you canreview whether your logic apps are following the default policies. Azure shows the health status for an Azure Logic Apps resource after you enable logging and correctly set up the logs' destination. This article explains how to configure diagnostic logging and make sure that all your logic apps are healthy resources.
Tip
To find the current status for the Azure Logic Apps service, review theAzure status page, which lists the status for different products and services in each available region.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription,create a free Azure account.

Enable diagnostic logging
Before you can view the resource health status for your logic apps, you must firstset up diagnostic logging. If you already have a Log Analytics workspace, you can enable logging either when you create your logic app or on existing logic apps.
Tip
The default recommendation is to enable diagnostic logs for Azure Logic Apps. However, you control this setting for your logic apps. When you enable diagnostic logs for your logic apps, you can use the information to help analyze security incidents.
Check diagnostic logging setting
If you're not sure whether your logic apps have diagnostic logging enabled, you can check in Defender for Cloud:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the search bar, enter and selectDefender for Cloud.
On the workload protection dashboard menu, underGeneral, selectRecommendations.
In the table of security suggestions, find and selectEnable auditing and logging>Diagnostic logs in Logic Apps should be enabledin the table of security controls.
On the recommendation page, expand theRemediation stepssection and review the options. You can enable Azure Logic Apps diagnostics by selecting theQuick Fix!button, or by following the manual remediation instructions.
View logic apps' health status
After you'veenabled diagnostic logging, you can see the health status of your logic apps in Defender for Cloud.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

If diagnostic logging is already enabled, there might be an issue with the destination for your logs. Reviewhow to fix issues with different diagnostic logging destinations.
Fix diagnostic logging for logic apps
If yourlogic apps are listed as unhealthy in Defender for Cloud, open your logic app in Code View in the Azure portal or through the Azure CLI. Then, check the destination configuration for your diagnostic logs:Azure Log Analytics,Azure Event Hubs, oran Azure Storage account.
Log Analytics and Event Hubs destinations
If you use Log Analytics or Event Hubs as the destination for your Azure Logic Apps diagnostic logs, check the following settings.
To confirm that you enabled diagnostic logs, check that the diagnostic settingslogs.enabledfield is set totrue.
logs.enabled
true
To confirm that you haven't set a storage account as the destination instead, check that thestorageAccountIdfield is set tofalse.
storageAccountId
false
For example:
"allOf": [
    {
        "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs.enabled",
        "equals": "true"
    },
    {
        "anyOf": [
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.enabled",
                "notEquals": "true"
            },
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/storageAccountId",
                "exists": false
            }
        ]
    }
]
"allOf": [
    {
        "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs.enabled",
        "equals": "true"
    },
    {
        "anyOf": [
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.enabled",
                "notEquals": "true"
            },
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/storageAccountId",
                "exists": false
            }
        ]
    }
]
Storage account destination
If you use a storage account as the destination for your Azure Logic Apps diagnostic logs, check the following settings.
To confirm that you enabled diagnostic logs, check that the diagnostics settingslogs.enabledfield is set totrue.
logs.enabled
true
To confirm that you enabled a retention policy for your diagnostic logs, check that theretentionPolicy.enabledfield is set totrue.
retentionPolicy.enabled
true
To confirm you set a retention time of 0-365 days, check theretentionPolicy.daysfield is set to a number inclusively between 0 and 365.
retentionPolicy.days
"allOf": [
    {
        "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.enabled",
        "equals": "true"
    },
    {
        "anyOf": [
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.days",
                "equals": "0"
            },
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.days",
                "equals": "[parameters('requiredRetentionDays')]"
            }
          ]
    },
    {
        "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs.enabled",
        "equals": "true"
    }
]
"allOf": [
    {
        "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.enabled",
        "equals": "true"
    },
    {
        "anyOf": [
            {

                "equals": "0"
            },
            {
                "field": "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/logs[*].retentionPolicy.days",
