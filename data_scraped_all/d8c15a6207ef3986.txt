When teams collaborate on Azure Machine Learning, they might face varying requirements to configure and organize resources. Machine learning teams might look for flexibility in how to organize workspaces for collaboration, or how to size compute clusters for the requirements of their use cases. In these scenarios, productivity could benefit if application teams can manage their own infrastructure.
As a platform administrator, you can use policies to lay out guardrails for teams to manage their own resources.Azure Policyhelps audit and govern resource state. This article explains how you can use audit controls and governance practices for Azure Machine Learning.
Policies for Azure Machine Learning
Azure Policyis a governance tool that allows you to ensure that Azure resources are compliant with your policies.
Azure Policy provides a set of policies that you can use for common scenarios with Azure Machine Learning. You can assign these policy definitions to your existing subscription or use them as the basis to create your owncustom definitions.
The following table lists the built-in policies you can assign with Azure Machine Learning. For a list of all Azure built-in policies, seeBuilt-in policies.
Policies can be set at different scopes, such as at the subscription or resource group level. For more information, see theAzure Policy documentation.
Assigning built-in policies
To view the built-in policy definitions related to Azure Machine Learning, use the following steps:
Go toAzure Policyin theAzure portal.
SelectDefinitions.
ForType, selectBuilt-in. ForCategory, selectMachine Learning.
From here, you can select policy definitions to view them. While viewing a definition, you can use theAssignlink to assign the policy to a specific scope, and configure the parameters for the policy. For more information, seeCreate a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources using Azure portal.
You can also assign policies by usingAzure PowerShell,Azure CLI, ortemplates.
Conditional access policies
To control who can access your Azure Machine Learning workspace, useMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access. To use Conditional Access for Azure Machine Learning workspaces,assign the Conditional Access policyto the app namedAzure Machine Learning. The app ID is0736f41a-0425-bdb5-1563eff02385.
Enable self-service using landing zones
Landing zones are an architectural pattern that accounts for scale, governance, security, and productivity when setting up Azure environments. A data landing zone is an administator-configured environment that an application team uses to host a data and analytics workload.
The purpose of the landing zone is to ensure that all infrastructure configuration work is done when a team starts in the Azure environment. For instance, security controls are set up in compliance with organizational standards and network connectivity is set up.
When you use the landing zones pattern, machine learning teams can deploy and manage their own resources on a self-service basis. By using Azure policy as an administrator, you can audit and manage Azure resources for compliance.
Azure Machine Learning integrates withdata landing zonesin theCloud Adoption Framework data management and analytics scenario. This reference implementation provides an optimized environment to migrate machine learning workloads onto Azure Machine Learning and includes preconfigured policies.
Configure built-in policies
Compute instance should have idle shutdown
This policy controls whether an Azure Machine Learning compute instance should have idle shutdown enabled. Idle shutdown automatically stops the compute instance when it's idle for a specified period of time. This policy is useful for cost savings and to ensure that resources aren't being used unnecessarily.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAudit,Deny, orDisabled. If set toAudit, you can create a compute instance without idle shutdown enabled and a warning event is created in the activity log.
Compute instances should be recreated to get software updates
Controls whether Azure Machine Learning compute instances should be audited to make sure they're running the latest available software updates. This policy is useful to ensure that compute instances are running the latest software updates to maintain security and performance. For more information, seeVulnerability management for Azure Machine Learning.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAuditorDisabled. If set toAudit, a warning event is created in the activity log when a compute isn't running the latest software updates.
Compute cluster and instance should be in a virtual network
Controls auditing of compute cluster and instance resources behind a virtual network.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAuditorDisabled. If set toAudit, you can create a compute that isn't configured behind a virtual network and a warning event is created in the activity log.
Computes should have local authentication methods disabled.
Controls whether an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster or instance should disable local authentication (SSH).
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAudit,Deny, orDisabled. If set toAudit, you can create a compute with SSH enabled and a warning event is created in the activity log.
If the policy is set toDeny, then you can't create a compute unless SSH is disabled. Attempting to create a compute with SSH enabled results in an error. The error is also logged in the activity log. The policy identifier is returned as part of this error.
Workspaces should be encrypted with customer-managed key
Controls whether a workspace should be encrypted with a customer-managed key, or with a Microsoft-managed key to encrypt metrics and metadata. For more information on using customer-managed key, see theAzure Cosmos DBsection of the data encryption article.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAuditorDeny. If set toAudit, you can create a workspace without a customer-managed key and a warning event is created in the activity log.
If the policy is set toDeny, then you can't create a workspace unless it specifies a customer-managed key. Attempting to create a workspace without a customer-managed key results in an error similar toResource 'clustername' was disallowed by policyand creates an error in the activity log. The policy identifier is also returned as part of this error.
Resource 'clustername' was disallowed by policy
Configure workspaces to disable public network access
Controls whether a workspace should disable network access from the public internet.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAudit,Deny, orDisabled. If set toAudit, you can create a workspace with public access and a warning event is created in the activity log.
If the policy is set toDeny, then you can't create a workspace that allows network access from the public internet.
Workspaces should enable V1LegacyMode to support network isolation backward compatibility
Controls whether a workspace should enable V1LegacyMode to support network isolation backward compatibility. This policy is useful if you want to keep Azure Machine Learning control plane data inside your private networks. For more information, seeNetwork isolation change with our new API platform.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAuditorDeny, orDisabled. If set toAudit, you can create a workspace without enabling V1LegacyMode and a warning event is created in the activity log.
If the policy is set toDeny, then you can't create a workspace unless it enables V1LegacyMode.
Workspaces should use private link
Controls whether a workspace should use Azure Private Link to communicate with Azure Virtual Network. For more information on using private link, seeConfigure a private endpoint for an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAuditorDeny. If set toAudit, you can create a workspace without using private link and a warning event is created in the activity log.
If the policy is set toDeny, then you can't create a workspace unless it uses a private link. Attempting to create a workspace without a private link results in an error. The error is also logged in the activity log. The policy identifier is returned as part of this error.
Workspaces should use user-assigned managed identity
Controls whether a workspace is created using a system-assigned managed identity (default) or a user-assigned managed identity. The managed identity for the workspace is used to access associated resources such as Azure Storage, Azure Container Registry, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Application Insights. For more information, seeSet up authentication between Azure Machine Learning and other services.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAudit,Deny, orDisabled. If set toAudit, you can create a workspace without specifying a user-assigned managed identity. A system-assigned identity is used, and a warning event is created in the activity log.
If the policy is set toDeny, then you can't create a workspace unless you provide a user-assigned identity during the creation process. Attempting to create a workspace without providing a user-assigned identity results in an error. The error is also logged to the activity log. The policy identifier is returned as part of this error.
Configure computes to modify/disable local authentication
This policy modifies any Azure Machine Learning compute cluster or instance creation request to disable local authentication (SSH).
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toModifyorDisabled. If setModify, any creation of a compute cluster or instance within the scope where the policy applies automatically has local authentication disabled.
Configure workspace to use private DNS zones
This policy configures a workspace to use a private DNS zone, overriding the default DNS resolution for a private endpoint.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toDeployIfNotExists. Set theprivateDnsZoneIdto the Azure Resource Manager ID of the private DNS zone to use.
Configure workspaces to disable public network access
Configures a workspace to disable network access from the public internet. Disabling public network access helps protect the workspaces against data leakage risks. You can instead access your workspace by creating private endpoints. For more information, seeConfigure a private endpoint for an Azure Machine Learning workspace.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toModifyorDisabled. If set toModify, any creation of a workspace within the scope where the policy applies automatically has public network access disabled.
Configure workspaces with private endpoints
Configures a workspace to create a private endpoint within the specified subnet of an Azure Virtual Network.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toDeployIfNotExists. Set theprivateEndpointSubnetIDto the Azure Resource Manager ID of the subnet.
Configure diagnostic workspaces to send logs to log analytics workspaces
Configures the diagnostic settings for an Azure Machine Learning workspace to send logs to a Log Analytics workspace.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toDeployIfNotExistsorDisabled. If set toDeployIfNotExists, the policy creates a diagnostic setting to send logs to a Log Analytics workspace if it doesn't already exist.
Resource logs in workspaces should be enabled
Audits whether resource logs are enabled for an Azure Machine Learning workspace. Resource logs provide detailed information about operations performed on resources in the workspace.
To configure this policy, set the effect parameter toAuditIfNotExistsorDisabled. If set toAuditIfNotExists, the policy audits if resource logs aren't enabled for the workspace.
Create custom definitions
When you need to create custom policies for your organization, you can use theAzure Policy definition structureto create your own definitions. You can use theAzure Policy Visual Studio Code extensionto author and test your policies.
To discover the policy aliases you can use in your definition, use the following Azure CLI command to list the aliases for Azure Machine Learning:
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.MachineLearningServices --expand "resourceTypes/aliases" --query "resourceTypes[].aliases[].name"
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.MachineLearningServices --expand "resourceTypes/aliases" --query "resourceTypes[].aliases[].name"
To discover the allowed values for a specific alias, visit theAzure Machine Learning REST APIreference.
