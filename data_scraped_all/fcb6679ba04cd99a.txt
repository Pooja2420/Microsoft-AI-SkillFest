You can use Azure DNS to host your DNS domain and manage your DNS records. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
Suppose you buy the domaincontoso.comfrom a domain name registrar and then create a zone with the namecontoso.comin Azure DNS. Since you're the owner of the domain, your registrar offers you the option to configure the name server (NS) records for your domain. The registrar stores the NS records in the.comparent zone. Internet users around the world are then directed to your domain in your Azure DNS zone when they try to resolve DNS records incontoso.com.
contoso.com
contoso.com
.com
contoso.com
Overview
To host your domain in Azure:
Create the DNS zone.
Create resource recordsin the DNS zone.
Retrieve the list of Azure nameservers for your DNS zone.
Delegate the domain to Azure's nameservers at your registrar.
For example:

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a DNS zone.
Retrieve a list of name servers.
Delegate the domain.
Verify the delegation is working.
If you donât have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.
A domain name that you can host in Azure DNS. You must have full control of this domain. Full control includes the ability to set the name server (NS) records for the domain.
Note
In this tutorial,contoso.xyzis used as an example domain name. Replacecontoso.xyzwith your own domain name.
contoso.xyz
contoso.xyz
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create a DNS zone
In the Azure portal, enterdns zonein the search box at the top of the portal, and then selectDNS zonesfrom the search results.

Retrieve name servers
Before you can delegate your DNS zone to Azure DNS, you need to know the name servers for your zone. Azure DNS assigns name servers from a pool each time a zone is created.
In the Azure portal, enterDNS zonesin the search box at the top of the portal and then selectDNS zonesfrom the search results.
InDNS zones, select the name of your zone. For example:contoso.xyz.
On theOverviewpage, retrieve the name servers. In this example, the DNS zonecontoso.xyzhas been assigned name serversns1-37.azure-dns.com,ns2-37.azure-dns.net,ns3-37.azure-dns.org, andns4-37.azure-dns.info:
ns1-37.azure-dns.com
ns2-37.azure-dns.net
ns3-37.azure-dns.org
ns4-37.azure-dns.info

Azure DNS automatically creates authoritative NS records in your zone for the assigned name servers.
Delegate the domain
After the DNS zone is created, you must update the parent domain with the Azure DNS name servers by registering the domain with a domain registrar. Each registrar has its own DNS management tools to assign the name server records for a domain. In the example used here, the parent domain isxyz.
In the registrar's DNS management page, create or edit the NS records to assign the Azure DNS name servers.
When you delegate a domain to Azure DNS, you must use the name servers that Azure DNS provides. Use all four name servers, regardless of the name of your domain. Domain delegation doesn't require a name server to use the same top-level domain as your domain.
Important
When you copy each name server address, make sure you copy the trailing period at the end of the address. The trailing period indicates the end of a fully qualified domain name. Some registrars append the period if the NS name doesn't have it at the end. To be compliant with the DNS RFC, include the trailing period.
Delegations that use name servers in your own zone, sometimes calledvanity name servers, aren't currently supported in Azure DNS.
Verify the delegation
After you complete the delegation, you can verify that it's working by using a tool such asnslookupto query the Start of Authority (SOA) record for your zone. The SOA record is automatically created when the zone is created. You may need to wait at least 10 minutes after you complete the delegation, before you can successfully verify that it's working. It can take a while for changes to propagate through the DNS system.
You don't have to specify the Azure DNS name servers. If the delegation is set up correctly, the normal DNS resolution process finds the name servers automatically.
From a command prompt, enter a nslookup command similar to the following example:nslookup -type=SOA contoso.xyz
From a command prompt, enter a nslookup command similar to the following example:
nslookup -type=SOA contoso.xyz
nslookup -type=SOA contoso.xyz
Verify that your response looks similar to the following nslookup output:contoso.xyz
        primary name server = ns1-37.azure-dns.com
        responsible mail addr = azuredns-hostmaster.microsoft.com
        serial = 1
        refresh = 3600 (1 hour)
        retry = 300 (5 mins)
        expire = 604800 (7 days)
        default TTL = 300 (5 mins)
