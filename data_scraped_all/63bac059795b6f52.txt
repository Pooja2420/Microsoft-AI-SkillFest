There are two competing aspects of log collection and retention that are critical to a successful threat detection program. On the one hand, you want to maximize the number of log sources that you collect, so that you have the most comprehensive security coverage possible. On the other hand, you need to minimize the costs incurred by the ingestion of all that data.
These competing needs require a log management strategy that balances data accessibility, query performance, and storage costs.
This article discusses categories of data and the retention states used to store and access your data. It also describes the log plans Microsoft Sentinel offers you to build a log management and retention strategy.
Important
Microsoft Sentinel is generally available within Microsoft's unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal.
Categories of ingested data
Microsoft recommends classifying data ingested into Microsoft Sentinel into two general categories:
Primary security datais data that contains critical security value. This data is used for real-time proactive monitoring, scheduled alerts, and analytics to detect security threats. The data needs to be readily available to all Microsoft Sentinel experiences in near real time.

Secondary security datais supplemental data, often in high-volume, verbose logs. This data is of limited security value, but it can provide added richness and context to detections and investigations, helping to draw the full picture of a security incident. It doesn't need to be readily available, but should be accessible on-demand as needed and in appropriate doses.

Primary security data
This category consists of logs that hold critical security value for your organization. Primary security data can be described by the following use cases for security operations:
Frequent monitoring.Threat detection (analytics) rulesare run on this data at frequent intervals or in near real time.

On-demand hunting. Complex queries are run on this data to execute interactive, high-performance hunting for security threats.

Correlation. Data from these sources is correlated with data from other primary security data sources to detect threats and build attack stories.

Regular reporting. Data from these sources is readily available for compiling into regular reports of the organization's security health, for both security and general decision makers.

Behavior analytics. Data from these sources is used to build baseline behavior profiles for your users and devices, enabling you to identify outlying behaviors as suspicious.

Some examples of primary data sources include logs from antivirus or enterprise detection and response (EDR) systems, authentication logs, audit trails from cloud platforms, threat intelligence feeds, and alerts from external systems.
Logs containing primary security data should be stored using theAnalytics logsplan described later in this article.
Secondary security data
This category encompasses logs whose individual security value is limited but are essential for providing a comprehensive view of a security incident or breach. Typically, these logs are high-volume and can be verbose. The security operations use cases for this data include the following:
Threat intelligence. Primary data can be checked against lists of Indicators of Compromise (IoC) or Indicators of Attack (IoA) to quickly and easily detect threats.

Ad-hoc hunting/investigations. Data can be queried interactively for 30 days, facilitating crucial analysis for threat hunting and investigations.

Some examples of secondary data log sources are cloud storage access logs, NetFlow logs, TLS/SSL certificate logs, firewall logs, proxy logs, and IoT logs. To learn more about how each of these sources brings value to security detections without being needed all the time, seeLog sources to use for Auxiliary Logs ingestion.
Logs containing secondary security data should be stored using theAuxiliary logsplan described later in this article.
(The existingBasic logsplan also serves this purpose, but it costs more and is not recommended for new instances.)
Log management plans
Microsoft Sentinel provides two different log storage plans, or types, to accommodate these categories of ingested data.
TheAnalytics logsplan is designed to store primary security data and make it easily and constantly accessible at high performance.

TheAuxiliary logsplan is designed to store secondary security data at very low cost for long periods of time, while still allowing for limited accessibility.

Each of these plans preserves data in two different states:
Theinteractive retentionstate is the initial state into which the data is ingested. This state allows different levels of access to the data, depending on the plan, and costs for this state vary widely, depending on the plan.

Thelong-term retentionstate preserves older data in its original tables for up to 12 years, atextremely low cost, regardless of the plan.

The following diagram summarizes and compares these two log management plans.

Analytics logs plan
TheAnalytics logsplan keeps data in theinteractive retentionstate for90 daysby default, extensible for up to two years. This interactive state, while expensive, allows you to query your data in unlimited fashion, with high performance, at no charge per query.
When the interactive retention period ends, data goes into thelong-term retentionstate, while remaining in its original table. The long-term retention period is not defined by default, but you can define it to last up to 12 years. This retention state preserves your data at extremely low cost, for regulatory compliance or internal policy purposes. You can access the data in this state only by using asearch joborrestoreto pull out limited sets of data into a new table in interactive retention, where you can bring the full query capabilities to bear on it.
Auxiliary logs plan
TheAuxiliary logsplan keeps data in theinteractive retentionstate for30 days. In the Auxiliary plan, this state has very low retention costs as compared to the Analytics plan. However, the query capabilities are limited: queries are charged per gigabyte of data scanned and are limited to a single table, and performance is significantly lower. While this data remains in the interactive retention state, you can runsummary ruleson this data to create tables of aggregate, summary data in the Analytics logs plan, so that you have the full query capabilities on this aggregate data.
When the interactive retention period ends, data goes into thelong-term retentionstate, remaining in its original table. Long-term retention in the auxiliary logs plan is similar to long-term retention in the analytics logs plan, except that the only option to access the data is with asearch job.Restoreis not supported for the auxiliary logs plan.
