This article describes how to configure communication with Azure Automation and Azure Monitor by using the Log Analytics gateway when computers that are directly connected or that are monitored by Operations Manager have no internet access.
The Log Analytics gateway is an HTTP forward proxy that supports HTTP tunneling using the HTTP CONNECT command. This gateway sends data to Azure Automation and a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor on behalf of the computers that can't directly connect to the internet. The gateway is only for log agent related connectivity and doesn't support Azure Automation features like runbook, DSC, and others.
Note
The Log Analytics gateway has been updated to work with the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) and will be supported beyond the deprecation date of legacy agent (MMA/OMS) on August 31, 2024.
The Log Analytics gateway supports:
Reporting up to the same Log Analytics workspaces configured on each agent behind it and that are configured with Azure Automation Hybrid Runbook Workers.
Windows computers on which either theAzure Monitor Agentor the legacy Microsoft Monitoring Agent is directly connected to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor. Both the source and the gateway server must be running the same agent. You can't stream events from a server running Azure Monitor agent through a server running the gateway with the Log Analytics agent.
Linux computers on which either theAzure Monitor Agentor the legacy Log Analytics agent for Linux is directly connected to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor.
System Center Operations Manager 2012 SP1 with UR7, Operations Manager 2012 R2 with UR3, or a management group in Operations Manager 2016 or later that is integrated with Log Analytics.
Some IT security policies don't allow internet connection for network computers. These unconnected computers could be point of sale (POS) devices or servers supporting IT services, for example. To connect these devices to Azure Automation or a Log Analytics workspace so you can manage and monitor them, configure them to communicate directly with the Log Analytics gateway. The Log Analytics gateway can receive configuration information and forward data on their behalf. If the computers are configured with the Log Analytics agent to directly connect to a Log Analytics workspace, the computers instead communicate with the Log Analytics gateway.
The Log Analytics gateway transfers data from the agents to the service directly. It doesn't analyze any of the data in transit and the gateway doesn't cache data when it loses connectivity with the service. When the gateway is unable to communicate with service, the agent continues to run and queues the collected data on the disk of the monitored computer. When the connection is restored, the agent sends the cached data collected to Azure Monitor.
When an Operations Manager management group is integrated with Log Analytics, the management servers can be configured to connect to the Log Analytics gateway to receive configuration information and send collected data, depending on the solution you have enabled. Operations Manager agents send some data to the management server. For example, agents might send Operations Manager alerts, configuration assessment data, instance space data, and capacity data. Other high-volume data, such as Internet Information Services (IIS) logs, performance data, and security events, is sent directly to the Log Analytics gateway.
If one or more Operations Manager Gateway servers are deployed to monitor untrusted systems in a perimeter network or an isolated network, those servers can't communicate with a Log Analytics gateway. Operations Manager Gateway servers can report only to a management server. When an Operations Manager management group is configured to communicate with the Log Analytics gateway, the proxy configuration information is automatically distributed to every agent-managed computer that is configured to collect log data for Azure Monitor, even if the setting is empty.
To provide high availability for directly connected or Operations Management groups that communicate with a Log Analytics workspace through the gateway, use network load balancing (NLB) to redirect and distribute traffic across multiple gateway servers. That way, if one gateway server goes down, the traffic is redirected to another available node.
The computer that runs the Log Analytics gateway requires the agent to identify the service endpoints that the gateway needs to communicate with. The agent also needs to direct the gateway to report to the same workspaces that the agents or Operations Manager management group behind the gateway are configured with. This configuration allows the gateway and the agent to communicate with their assigned workspace.
A gateway can be multihomed to up to 10 workspaces using the Azure Monitor Agent anddata collection rules. Using the legacy Microsoft Monitor Agent, you can only multihome up to four workspaces as that is the total number of workspaces the legacy Windows agent supports.
Each agent must have network connectivity to the gateway so that agents can automatically transfer data to and from the gateway. Avoid installing the gateway on a domain controller. Linux computers that are behind a gateway server can't use thewrapper script installationmethod to install the Log Analytics agent for Linux. The agent must be downloaded manually, copied to the computer, and installed manually because the gateway only supports communicating with the Azure services mentioned earlier.
The following diagram shows data flowing from direct agents, through the gateway, to Azure Automation and Log Analytics. The agent proxy configuration must match the port that the Log Analytics gateway is configured with.

The following diagram shows data flow from an Operations Manager management group to Log Analytics.

Set up your system
Computers designated to run the Log Analytics gateway must have the following configuration:

Supported encryption protocols
The Log Analytics gateway supports only Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. It doesn't support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). To ensure the security of data in transit to Log Analytics, configure the gateway to use at least TLS 1.3. Although they currently allow for backward compatibility, avoid using older versions because they're vulnerable.
Note
The gateway is a forwarding proxy that doesn't store any data. Once the agent establishes connection with Azure Monitor, it follows the same encryption flow with or without the gateway. The data is encrypted between the client and the endpoint. Since the gateway is just a tunnel, it doesn't have the ability the inspect what is being sent.
Supported number of agent connections
The following table shows approximately how many agents can communicate with a gateway server. Support is based on agents that upload about 200 KB of data every 6 seconds. For each agent tested, data volume is about 2.7 GB per day.

Install the Log Analytics gateway using the command line
The downloaded file for the gateway is a Windows Installer package that supports silent installation from the command line or other automated method. If you aren't familiar with the standard command-line options for Windows Installer, seeCommand-line options.
The following table highlights the parameters supported by setup.
To silently install the gateway and configure it with a specific proxy address, port number, type the following:
Msiexec.exe /I "oms gateway.msi" /qn PORTNUMBER=8080 PROXY="10.80.2.200" HASPROXY=1 LicenseAccepted=1
Msiexec.exe /I "oms gateway.msi" /qn PORTNUMBER=8080 PROXY="10.80.2.200" HASPROXY=1 LicenseAccepted=1
Using the /qn command-line option hides setup, /qb shows setup during silent install.
If you need to provide credentials to authenticate with the proxy, type the following:
Msiexec.exe /I "oms gateway.msi" /qn PORTNUMBER=8080 PROXY="10.80.2.200" HASPROXY=1 HASAUTH=1 USERNAME="<username>" PASSWORD="<password>" LicenseAccepted=1
Msiexec.exe /I "oms gateway.msi" /qn PORTNUMBER=8080 PROXY="10.80.2.200" HASPROXY=1 HASAUTH=1 USERNAME="<username>" PASSWORD="<password>" LicenseAccepted=1
After installation, you can confirm the settings are accepted (excluding the username and password) using the following PowerShell cmdlets:
Get-OMSGatewayConfigâ Returns the TCP Port the gateway is configured to listen on.
Get-OMSGatewayRelayProxyâ Returns the IP address of the proxy server you configured it to communicate with.
Configure network load balancing
You can configure the gateway for high availability using network load balancing (NLB) using either MicrosoftNetwork Load Balancing (NLB),Azure Load Balancer, or hardware-based load balancers. The load balancer manages traffic by redirecting the requested connections from the Log Analytics agents or Operations Manager management servers across its nodes. If one Gateway server goes down, the traffic gets redirected to other nodes.
Microsoft Network Load Balancing
To learn how to design and deploy a Windows Server 2016 network load balancing cluster, seeNetwork load balancing. The following steps describe how to configure a Microsoft network load balancing cluster.
Sign onto the Windows server that is a member of the NLB cluster with an administrative account.

Azure Load Balancer
To learn how to design and deploy an Azure Load Balancer, seeWhat is Azure Load Balancer?. To deploy a basic load balancer, follow the steps outlined in thisquickstartexcluding the steps outlined in the sectionCreate back-end servers.
Note
Configuring the Azure Load Balancer using theBasic SKU, requires that Azure virtual machines belong to an Availability Set. To learn more about availability sets, seeManage the availability of Windows virtual machines in Azure. To add existing virtual machines to an availability set, refer toSet Azure Resource Manager VM Availability Set.
After the load balancer is created, a backend pool needs to be created, which distributes traffic to one or more gateway servers. Follow the steps described in the quickstart article sectionCreate resources for the load balancer.
Note
When configuring the health probe, it should be configured to use the TCP port of the gateway server. The health probe dynamically adds or removes the gateway servers from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks.
Configure the Azure Monitor agent to communicate using Log Analytics gateway
To configure the Azure Monitor agent (installed on the gateway server) to use the gateway to upload data for Windows or Linux:
Follow the instructions toconfigure proxy settings on the agentand provide the IP address and port number corresponding to the gateway server. If you have deployed multiple gateway servers behind a load balancer, the agent proxy configuration is the virtual IP address of the load balancer instead.

Configure the Log Analytics agent and Operations Manager management group
In this section, you learn how to configure directly connected legacy Log Analytics agents, an Operations Manager management group, or Azure Automation Hybrid Runbook Workers with the Log Analytics gateway to communicate with Azure Automation or Log Analytics.
Configure a standalone Log Analytics agent
When configuring the legacy Log Analytics agent, replace the proxy server value with the IP address of the Log Analytics gateway server and its port number. If you have deployed multiple gateway servers behind a load balancer, the Log Analytics agent proxy configuration is the virtual IP address of the load balancer.
Note
To install the Log Analytics agent on the gateway and Windows computers that directly connect to Log Analytics, seeConnect Windows computers to the Log Analytics service in Azure. To connect Linux computers, seeConnect Linux computers to Azure Monitor.
After you install the agent on the gateway server, configure it to report to the workspace or workspace agents that communicate with the gateway. If the Log Analytics Windows agent isn't installed on the gateway, event 300 is written to the OMS Gateway event log, indicating that the agent needs to be installed. If the agent is installed but not configured to report to the same workspace as the agents that communicate through it, event 105 is written to the same log, indicating that the agent on the gateway needs to be configured to report to the same workspace as the agents that communicate with the gateway.
After you complete configuration, restart theOMS Gatewayservice to apply the changes. Otherwise, the gateway rejects agents that attempt to communicate with Log Analytics and reports event 105 in the OMS Gateway event log. This also happens when you add or remove a workspace from the agent configuration on the gateway server.
For information related to the Automation Hybrid Runbook Worker, seeAutomate resources in your datacenter or cloud by using Hybrid Runbook Worker.
Configure Operations Manager, where all agents use the same proxy server
The Operations Manager proxy configuration is automatically applied to all agents that report to Operations Manager, even if the setting is empty.
To use OMS Gateway to support Operations Manager, you must have:
Microsoft Monitoring Agent (version 8.0.10900.0 or later) installed on the OMS Gateway server and configured with the same Log Analytics workspaces that your management group is configured to report to.
Internet connectivity. Alternatively, OMS Gateway must be connected to a proxy server that is connected to the internet.
Note
If you specify no value for the gateway, blank values are pushed to all agents.
If your Operations Manager management group is registering with a Log Analytics workspace for the first time, you won't see the option to specify the proxy configuration for the management group in the Operations console. This option is available only if the management group has been registered with the service.
To configure integration, update the system proxy configuration by using Netsh on the system where you're running the Operations console and on all management servers in the management group. Follow these steps:
Open an elevated command prompt:SelectStartand entercmd.Right-clickCommand Promptand selectRun as administrator.
Open an elevated command prompt:
SelectStartand entercmd.
SelectStartand entercmd.
Right-clickCommand Promptand selectRun as administrator.

Enter the following command:netsh winhttp set proxy <proxy>:<port>
Enter the following command:
netsh winhttp set proxy <proxy>:<port>
netsh winhttp set proxy <proxy>:<port>
After completing the integration with Log Analytics, remove the change by runningnetsh winhttp reset proxy. Then, in the Operations console, use theConfigure proxy serveroption to specify the Log Analytics gateway server.
netsh winhttp reset proxy

Configure Operations Manager, where specific agents use a proxy server
For large or complex environments, you might want only specific servers (or groups) to use the Log Analytics gateway server. For these servers, you can't update the Operations Manager agent directly because this value is overwritten by the global value for the management group. Instead, override the rule used to push these values.
Note
Use this configuration technique if you want to allow for multiple Log Analytics gateway servers in your environment. For example, you can require specific Log Analytics gateway servers to be specified on a regional basis.
