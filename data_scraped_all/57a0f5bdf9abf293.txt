This article shows you how to migrate an active DNS name toAzure App Servicewithout any downtime.
When you migrate a live site and its DNS domain name to App Service, that DNS name is already serving live traffic. You can avoid downtime in DNS resolution during the migration by preemptively binding the active DNS name to your App Service app.
If you're not concerned about downtime in DNS resolution, seeMap an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service.
Prerequisites
To complete the steps,make sure that your App Service app isn't in the Free tier.
1. Get a domain verification ID
When you preemptively bind a custom domain, you accomplish both of the following before making any changes to
your existing DNS records:
Verify domain ownership by adding a domain verification ID with your domain provider.
Enable the domain name in your App Service app.
When you later migrate your custom DNS name from the old site to the App Service app, there will be no downtime in DNS resolution.
In theAzure portal, open the management pane of the App Service app.

In the left pane of your app page, selectCustom domains.
In the left pane of your app page, selectCustom domains.
From theCustom domainspane, copy the ID in theCustom Domain Verification IDbox. You use this ID in later steps.

2. Create the DNS records
Sign in to the website of your domain provider.You can use Azure DNS to manage DNS records for your domain and configure a custom DNS name for Azure App Service. For more information, seeTutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS.

Find the page for managing DNS records.Every domain provider has its own DNS records interface, so consult the provider's documentation. Look for areas of the site labeledDomain Name,DNS, orName Server Management.Often, you can find the DNS records page by viewing your account information and then looking for a link likeMy domains. Go to that page, and then look for a link that's named something likeZone file,DNS Records, orAdvanced configuration.The following screenshot is an example of a DNS records page:

Note
For certain providers, such as GoDaddy, changes to DNS records don't become effective until you select a separateSave Changeslink.
Add aTXT recordfor domain verification. The host name for theTXT recorddepends on the type of DNS record that you want to map. See the following table (@typically represents the root domain):
TXT record
TXT record
@
\@
_asuid_
www
_asuid.www_
\*
_asuid_
Note
Wildcard*records don't validate subdomains with an existingCNAME record. You might need to explicitly create aTXT recordfor each subdomain.

3. Enable the domain for your app
On theCustom domainspane, selectAdd custom domain.

ForTLS/SSL type, select the binding type you want.SettingDescriptionCustom domainThe domain name for which you're adding the TLS/SSL binding.Private Certificate ThumbprintThe certificate to bind.TLS/SSL TypeSNI SSL: Multiple Server Name Indication (SNI) SSL bindings might be added. This option allows multiple TLS/SSL certificates to secure multiple domains on the same IP address. Most modern browsers (including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera) support SNI (for more information, seeServer Name Indication).IP SSL: Only one IP SSL binding can be added. This option allows only one TLS/SSL certificate to secure a dedicated public IP address. After you configure the binding, follow the steps inRemap records for IP-based SSL.IP-based SSL is supported only in Standard tier or above.
ForTLS/SSL type, select the binding type you want.
Type the fully qualified domain name that you want to migrate and that corresponds to theTXT recordthat you created. For example:contoso.com,www.contoso.com, or*.contoso.com.

SelectValidate. Although the dialog shows two records that you need for your app's custom domain to function, the validation passes with just the domain verification ID (theTXT record).

If theDomain validationsection shows green check marks, then you configured the domain verification ID correctly. SelectAdd. If it shows any red X marks, fix the errors on your domain provider's website.

You should see the custom domain in the list. You might also see a red X withNo binding.Because you selectedAdd certificate later, you see a red X withNo binding. It remains until youadd a private certificate for the domainandconfigure the binding.NoteUnless you configure a certificate binding for your custom domain, any HTTPS request from a browser to the domain receives an error or warning, depending on the browser.

4. Remap the active DNS name
Remap your active DNS record to point to App Service. Until this step is complete, it still points to your old site.
A recordonly: Get the App Service app's external IP address. On theCustom domainspane, copy the app's IP address.

DNS queries should start resolving to your App Service app immediately after DNS propagation happens.
Frequently asked questions
Can I add an App Service managed certificate when migrating a live domain?
How do I migrate a domain from another app?
Can I add an App Service managed certificate when migrating a live domain?
You can add an App Service managed certificate to a migrated live domain, but only after youremap the active DNS name. To add the App Service managed certificate, seeCreate a free managed certificate.
How do I migrate a domain from another app?
You can migrate an active custom domain in Azure between subscriptions or within the same subscription. However, to achieve a migration without downtime, the source app and the target app must be assigned the same custom domain at a certain time. Therefore, you need to make sure that the two apps aren't deployed to the same deployment unit (internally known as a webspace). A domain name can be assigned to only one app in each deployment unit.
You can find the deployment unit for your app by looking at the domain name of the FTP/S URL<deployment-unit>.ftp.azurewebsites.windows.net. Make sure the deployment unit is different between the source app and the target app. The deployment unit of an app is determined by theApp Service planit's in. Azure randomly selects it when you create the plan and it can't be changed. When you create two appsin the same resource groupandthe same region, Azure puts them in the same deployment unit. However, there's no way to make sure that the opposite is true. In other words, the only way to create a plan in a different deployment unit is to keep creating a plan in a new resource group or region until you get a different deployment unit.
<deployment-unit>.ftp.azurewebsites.windows.net
