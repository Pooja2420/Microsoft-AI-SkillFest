Azure Pipelines provides a YAML pipeline editor that you can use to author and edit your pipelines. The YAML editor is based on theMonaco Editor. The editor provides tools like Intellisense support and a task assistant to provide guidance while you edit a pipeline.
This article shows you how to edit your pipelines using the YAML Pipeline editor, but you can also edit pipelines by modifying theazure-pipelines.ymlfile directly in your pipeline's repository using a text editor of your choice, or by using a tool like Visual Studio Code and theAzure Pipelines for VS Codeextension.
Edit a YAML pipeline
To access the YAML pipeline editor, do the following steps.

Validate
Validate your changes to catch syntax errors in your pipeline that prevent it from starting. ChooseMore actions>Validate.

Azure Pipelines validates your pipelines each time you save. ChooseValidate and saveto validate your pipeline before saving. If there are any errors, you canCancelorSave anyway. To save your pipeline without validating, chooseSave without validating.

Azure Pipelines detects incorrect variable definitions defined at the pipeline, stage, and job level and detects incorrect YAML conditions defined at the pipeline, stage, and job level.
Download full YAML
You canpreview the fully parsed YAML documentwithout committing or running the pipeline. ChooseMore actions>Download full YAML.

Download full YAMLRunsthe Azure DevOps REST API for Azure Pipelines and initiates a download of the rendered YAML from the editor.
Manage pipeline variables
You can manage pipeline variables both from within your YAML pipeline and from the pipeline settings UI.
To manage pipeline variables, do the following steps.

Configure the default agent pool

View and edit templates
Note
This feature is available starting in Azure DevOps Server 2022.1.
Templatesare a commonly used feature in YAML pipelines. They're an easy way to share pipeline snippets and are a powerful mechanism for verifying and enforcingsecurity and governancein your pipeline.
Previously, the editor didn't support templates, so authors of YAML pipelines couldn't get intellisense assistance. Now Azure Pipelines supports a YAML editor, for which we're previewing support. To enable this preview,go to preview featuresin your Azure DevOps organization, and enableYAML templates editor.
Important
This feature has the following limitations.
If the template has required parameters that aren't provided as inputs in the main YAML file, then the validation fails and prompts you to provide those inputs.

You can't create a new template from the editor. You can only use or edit existing templates.

As you edit your main Azure Pipelines YAML file, you can eitherincludeorextenda template. As you enter the name of your template, you may be prompted to validate your template. Once validated, the YAML editor understands the schema of the template, including the input parameters.

Post validation, you can go into the template by choosingView template, which opens the template in a new browser tab. You can make changes to the template using all the features of the YAML editor.
