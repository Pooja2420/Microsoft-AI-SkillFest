View the circuits and properties
View all the circuits
You can view all the circuits that you created by searching forExpressRoute circuitsin the search box at the top of the portal.

All Expressroute circuits created in the subscription appear here.
View the properties
You can view the properties of the circuit by selecting it. On the Overview page for your circuit, you find theService Key. Provide the service key to your service provider to complete the provisioning process. The service key is unique to your circuit.

Send the service key to your connectivity provider for provisioning
On this page,Provider statusgives you the current state of provisioning on the service-provider side.Circuit statusprovides you with the state on the Microsoft side. For more information about circuit provisioning states, see theWorkflowsarticle.
When you create a new ExpressRoute circuit, the circuit is in the following state:
Provider status:Not provisionedCircuit status:Enabled
The circuit changes to the following state when the connectivity provider is currently enabling it for you:
Provider status:ProvisioningCircuit status:Enabled
To use the ExpressRoute circuit, it must be in the following state:
Provider status:ProvisionedCircuit status:Enabled
Periodically check the status and the state of the circuit key
You can view the properties of a circuit that you're interested in by selecting it. Check theProvider statusand ensure that it has moved toProvisionedbefore you continue.
Create your routing configuration
For step-by-step instructions, refer to theExpressRoute circuit routing configurationarticle to create and modify circuit peerings.
Important
These instructions only apply to circuits that are created with service providers that offer layer 2 connectivity services. If you're using a service provider that offers managed layer 3 services (typically an IP VPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider configures and manages routing for you.
Link a virtual network to an ExpressRoute circuit
Next, link a virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit. Use theLinking virtual networks to ExpressRoute circuitsarticle when you work with the Resource Manager deployment model.
Getting the status of an ExpressRoute circuit
You can view the status of a circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page.
Modifying an ExpressRoute circuit
You can modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity. You can modify the bandwidth, SKU, billing model and allow classic operations on theConfigurationpage. For information on limits and limitations, see theExpressRoute FAQ.
You can do the following tasks with no downtime:
Enable or disable an ExpressRoute Premium add-on for your ExpressRoute circuit.ImportantChanging the SKU fromStandard/PremiumtoLocalis not supported in Azure portal. To downgrade the SKU toLocal, you can useAzure PowerShellorAzure CLI.
