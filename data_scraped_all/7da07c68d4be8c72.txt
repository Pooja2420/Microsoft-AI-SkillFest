This checklist presents a set of recommendations about cost optimization for your workload to help you achieve a high return on investment (ROI) based on the business value that your workload delivers. Cost optimization balances actual costs versus perceived value, team efficiency, focus, and effort, while meeting the defined functional and nonfunctional requirements of your workload.
Every workload has direct and indirect costs, and every workload is designed to deliver value. If you don't incorporate the recommendations in this article and consider the tradeoffs, your design might not make the best use of your time and money. Carefully consider the points covered in the following checklist to instill confidence in your design's success.
Cost optimization is a continuous process in which you optimize workload costs and align your workload with the broader governance discipline of cost management. What's important today might not be important tomorrow. Technology choices or options and features that your platform offers today might be different. Learn from production and nonproduction environments, be aware of platform changes, and apply your findings to your workload and your workload's dependencies.
