In this article, you'll learn about the different ways in which you can connect Azure Data Explorer as a data source to Power BI. Once connected, you can proceed to build Power BI reports.
Prerequisites
A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity. An Azure subscription isn't required.
An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database.Create a cluster and database.
Power BI Desktop.
Connectivity modes
Power BI supportsImportandDirectQueryconnectivity modes. When building Power BI reports or dashboards, choose your connectivity mode depending on your scenario, scale, and performance requirements. UsingImportmode copies your data to Power BI. In contrast, usingDirectQuerymode queries your data directly from your Azure Data Explorer cluster.
UseImportmode when:
Your dataset is small and you don't need near real-time data.
You performaggregation in Kusto.
UseDirectQuerymode when:
Your dataset is large or you need near real-time data.
For more information on connectivity modes, seeImport and Direct Query connectivity modes.
Use data in Power BI
You can connect Azure Data Explorer as a data source to Power BI in the following ways:
Starting in Azure Data Explorer web UI and then pasting the data in Power BI Desktop.
Starting directly in Power BI Desktop and then adding the Azure Data Explorer connector.
In the following steps, we'll be using the StormEvents table from ourhelp clusterto demonstrate how to use Azure Data explorer data in Power BI.
Web UI
Connector
In the Azure Data Explorer web UI, on the left menu, selectQuery, and then select the database with your data.

Create a query and select it. For example, the following query from theSamples>StormEventstable, returns storm events that caused the most crop damage:StormEvents
| sort by DamageCrops desc
| take 1000
