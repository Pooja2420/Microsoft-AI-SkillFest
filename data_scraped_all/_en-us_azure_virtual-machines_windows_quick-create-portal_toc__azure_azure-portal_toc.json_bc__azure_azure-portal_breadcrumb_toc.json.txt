Azure virtual machines (VMs) can be created through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface to create VMs and their associated resources. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure portal to deploy a virtual machine (VM) in Azure that runs Windows Server 2022 Datacenter. To see your VM in action, you then RDP to the VM and install the IIS web server.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.

Connect to virtual machine
Create a remote desktop connection to the virtual machine. These directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as thisRemote Desktop Clientfrom the Mac App Store.
On the overview page for your virtual machine, select theConnect>RDP.
On the overview page for your virtual machine, select theConnect>RDP.

In theConnect with RDPtab, keep the default options to connect by IP address, over port 3389, and clickDownload RDP file.

Install web server
To see your VM in action, install the IIS web server. Open a PowerShell prompt on the VM and run the following command:
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
When done, close the RDP connection to the VM.
View the IIS welcome page
In the portal, select the VM and in the overview of the VM, hover over the IP address to showCopy to clipboard. Copy the IP address and paste it into a browser tab. The default IIS welcome page will open, and should look like this:

Clean up resources
Delete resources
When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources.
On the Overview page for the VM, select theResource grouplink.
At the top of the page for the resource group, selectDelete resource group.
A page will open warning you that you are about to delete resources. Type the name of the resource group and selectDeleteto finish deleting the resources and the resource group.
Auto-shutdown
If the VM is still needed, Azure provides an Auto-shutdown feature for virtual machines to help manage costs and ensure you are not billed for unused resources.
On theOperationssection for the VM, select theAuto-shutdownoption.
A page will open where you can configure the auto-shutdown time. Select theOnoption to enable and then set a time that works for you.
Once you have set the time, selectSaveat the top to enable your Auto-shutdown configuration.
Note
Remember to configure the time zone correctly to match your requirements, as (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time is the default setting in the Time zone dropdown.
For more information seeAuto-shutdown.
Next steps
In this quickstart, you deployed a simple virtual machine, opened a network port for web traffic, and installed a basic web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Windows VMs.
