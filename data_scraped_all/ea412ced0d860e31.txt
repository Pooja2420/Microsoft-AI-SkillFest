If you're a managed security service provider (MSSP) and you're usingAzure Lighthouseto offer security operations center (SOC) services to your customers, you can manage your customers' Microsoft Sentinel resources directly from your own Azure tenant, without having to connect to the customer's tenant. The Microsoft Sentinel technical playbook for MSSPs is a great source for best practices. For more information, download the technical playbook here athttps://aka.ms/mssentinelmssp.
Prerequisites
Onboard Azure Lighthouse
Verify registration of Microsoft Sentinel resource providers
To manage multiple tenants properly, your MSSP tenant must have the Microsoft Sentinel resource providers registered on at least one subscription, and each of your customers' tenants must have the resource providers registered.
If you have registered Microsoft Sentinel in your tenant, and your customers in theirs, you're ready to get started and can continue withAccess Microsoft Sentinel in managed tenants.
To verify registration:
SelectSubscriptionsfrom the Azure portal, and then select a relevant subscription from the menu.

UnderDirectory + subscription, select the delegated directories (directory = tenant), and the subscriptions where your customer's Microsoft Sentinel workspaces are located.

Open Microsoft Sentinel, where you'll see all the workspaces in the selected subscriptions and can work with them seamlessly, just like any workspace in your own tenant.

Note
You will not be able to deploy connectors in Microsoft Sentinel from within a managed workspace configured with Azure Lighthouse alone. To deploy a connector in this manner, you must also configure GDAP. For detailed information on this topic, see (The Microsoft Sentinel technical playbook for MSSPs)(https://aka.ms/mssentinelmssp).
