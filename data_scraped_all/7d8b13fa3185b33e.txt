Before you start, be sure to read the general guidance on how to migrate from Gen1 to Gen2 inAzure Data Lake Storage migration guidelines and patterns.
Your account might not qualify for portal-based migration based on certain constraints. When theMigrate databutton is not enabled in the Azure portal for your Gen1 account, if you have a support plan, you canfile a support request. You can also get answers from community experts inMicrosoft Q&A.
Note
For easier reading, this article uses the termGen1to refer to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, and the termGen2to refer to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Step 1: Create a storage account with Gen2 capabilities
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 isn't a dedicated storage account or service type. It's a set of capabilities that you can obtain by enabling theHierarchical namespacefeature of an Azure storage account. To create an account that has Gen2 capabilities, seeCreate a storage account to use with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
As you create the account, make sure to configure settings with the following values.
Note
The migration tool in the Azure portal doesn't move account settings. Therefore, after you've created the account, you'll have to manually configure settings such as encryption, network firewalls, data protection.
Important
Ensure that you use a fresh, newly created storage account that has no history of use.Don'tmigrate to a previously used account or use an account in which containers have been deleted to make the account empty.
Step 2: Verify Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role assignments
For Gen2, ensure that theStorage Blob Data Ownerrole has been assigned to your Microsoft Entra user identity in the scope of the storage account, parent resource group, or subscription.
For Gen1, ensure that theOwnerrole has been assigned to your Microsoft Entra identity in the scope of the Gen1 account, parent resource group, or subscription.
Step 3: Migrate Azure Data Lake Analytics workloads
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 doesn't support Azure Data Lake Analytics. Azure Data Lake Analyticswill be retiredon February 29, 2024. If you attempt to use the Azure portal to migrate an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 account that is used for Azure Data Lake Analytics, it's possible that you'll break your Azure Data Lake Analytics workloads. You must firstmigrate your Azure Data Lake Analytics workloads to Azure Synapse Analyticsor another supported compute platform before attempting to migrate your Gen1 account.
For more information, seeManage Azure Data Lake Analytics using the Azure portal.
Step 4: Prepare the Gen1 account
File or directory names with only spaces or tabs, ending with a., containing a:, or with multiple consecutive forward slashes (//) aren't compatible with Gen2. You need to rename these files or directories before you migrate.

For the better performance, consider delaying the migration for at least ten days from the time of the last delete operation. In a Gen1 account, deleted files becomesoftdeleted files, and the Garbage Collector won't remove them permanently until seven days and will take a few extra days to process the cleanup. The time it takes for cleanup will depend on the number of files. All files, including soft deleted files, are processed during migration. If you wait until the Garbage Collector has permanently removed deleted files, your wait time can improve.
Step 5: Perform the migration
Before you begin, review the two migration options below, and decide whether to only copy data from Gen1 to Gen2 (recommended) or perform a complete migration.
Option 1: Copy data only (recommended).In this option, data is copied from Gen1 to Gen2. As the data is being copied, the Gen1 account becomes read-only. After the data is copied, both the Gen1 and Gen2 accounts will be accessible. However, you must update the applications and compute workloads to use the new Gen2 endpoint.
Option 2: Perform a complete migration.In this option, data is copied from Gen1 to Gen2. After the data is copied, all the traffic from the Gen1 account will be redirected to the Gen2-enabled account. Redirected requests use theGen1 compatibility layerto translate Gen1 API calls to Gen2 equivalents. During the migration, the Gen1 account becomes read-only. After the migration is complete, the Gen1 account won't be accessible.
Whichever option you choose, after you've migrated and verified that all your workloads work as expected, you can delete the Gen1 account.

You can stop the migration at any time before the URI is redirected by selecting theStop migrationbutton.

Step 6: Verify that the migration completed
If the migration completes successfully, then a container namedgen1will be created in the Gen2-enabled account, and all data from the Gen1 account will be copied to this newgen1container. In order to find the data on a path that existed on Gen1, you must add the prefixgen1/to the same path to access it on Gen2. For example, a path that was named 'FolderRoot/FolderChild/FileName.csv' on Gen1 will be available at 'gen1/FolderRoot/FolderChild/FileName.csv' on Gen2. Container names can't be renamed on Gen2, so thisgen1container on Gen2 can't be renamed post migration. However, the data can be copied to a new container in Gen2 if needed.
If the migration doesn't complete successfully, a message appears which states that the migration is stalled due to incompatibilities. If you would like assistance with the next step, then please contactMicrosoft Support. This message can appear if the Gen2-enabled account was previously used or when files and directories in the Gen1 account use incompatible naming conventions.
Before contacting support, ensure that you're using a fresh, newly created storage account that has no history of use. Avoid migrating to a previously used account or an account in which containers have been deleted to make the account empty. In your Gen1 account, ensure that you rename any file or directory names that contain only spaces or tabs, end with a., contain a:, or contain multiple forward slashes (//).

Search for URI references that contain the stringadl://in code files, or in Databricks notebooks, Apache Hive HQL files or any other file used as part of your workloads. Replace these references with theGen2 formatted URIof your new storage account. For example: the Gen1 URI:adl://mydatalakestore.azuredatalakestore.net/mydirectory/myfilemight becomeabfss://myfilesystem@mydatalakestore.dfs.core.windows.net/mydirectory/myfile.

Gen1 compatibility layer
This layer attempts to provide application compatibility between Gen1 and Gen2 as a convenience during the migration, so that applications can continue using Gen1 APIs to interact with data in the Gen2-enabled account. This layer has limited functionality and it's advised to validate the workloads with test accounts if you use this approach as part of migration. The compatibility layer runs on the server, so there's nothing to install.
Important
Microsoft does not recommend this capability as a replacement for migrating your workloads and applications. Support for the Gen1 compatibility layer will end when Gen1is retired on Feb. 29, 2024.
To encounter the least number of issues with the compatibility layer, make sure that your Gen1 SDKs use the following versions (or higher).
The following functionality isn't supported in the compatibility layer.

Frequently asked questions
Data and metadata are migrated in parallel. The total time required to complete a migration is equal to whichever of these two processes complete last.
The following table shows the approximate speed of each migration processing task.
Note
These time estimates are approximate and can vary. For example, copying a large number of small files can slow performance.
1The additional metadata processing time applies only if you choose theCopy data to a new Gen2 accountoption. This processing time does not apply if you choose theComplete migration to a new gen2 accountoption.
This example assumes300 TBof data and200 milliondata and metadata items.
This example assumes that2 TBof data and56 thousanddata and metadata items.
There's no cost to use the portal-based migration tool, however you'll be billed for usage of Azure Data Lake Gen1 and Gen2 services. During the data migration, you'll be billed for the data storage and transactions of the Gen1 account.
Post migration, if you chose the option that copies only data, then you'll be billed for the data storage and transactions for both Azure Data Lake Gen1 and Gen2 accounts. To avoid being billed for the Gen1 account, delete the Gen1 account after you've updated your applications to point to Gen2. If you chose to perform a complete migration, you'll be billed only for the data storage and transactions of the Gen2-enabled account.
Make sure all your Azure Data lake Analytics accounts aremigrated to Azure Synapse Analyticsor another supported compute platform. Once Azure Data Lake Analytics accounts are migrated, retry the consent. If you see the issue further and you have a support plan, you canfile a support request. You can also get answers from community experts inMicrosoft Q&A.
If you usedOption 1: Copy data from Gen1 to Gen2mentioned above, then both the Gen1 and Gen2 accounts are available for reads and writes post migration. However, if you usedOption 2: Perform a complete migration, then going back to the Gen1 account isn't supported. In Option 2, after the migration completes, the data in your Gen1 account won't be accessible and will be deleted after 30 days. You can continue to view the Gen1 account in the Azure portal, and when you're ready, you can delete the Gen1 account.
Once the migration is complete, both in "Copy data" and "Complete migration" options, you can go ahead and change the redundancy option to GRS as long as you don't plan to use the application compatibility layer. The application compatibility won't work on accounts that use GRS redundancy.
When we copy the data over to your Gen2-enabled account, we automatically create a container named 'Gen1'. In Gen2 container names can't be renamed and hence post migration data can be copied to new container in Gen2 as needed.
When you copy the data over to your Gen2-enabled account, two factors that can affect performance are the number of files and the amount of metadata you have. For example, many small files can affect the performance of the migration.
WebHDFS File System APIs of Gen1 will be supported on Gen2 but with certain deviations, and only limited functionality is supported via the compatibility layer. Customers should plan to leverage Gen2-specific APIs for better performance and features.
