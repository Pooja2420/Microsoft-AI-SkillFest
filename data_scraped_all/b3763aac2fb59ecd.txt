This article describes how to enable the collection of diagnostic resource logs, including Traffic Manager Probe Health Results, for a Traffic Manager profile.
Azure Traffic Manager resource logs can provide insight into the behavior of the Traffic Manager profile resource. For example, you can use the profile's log data to determine why individual probes have timed out against an endpoint.

Enable resource logging
Retrieve the Traffic Manager profile:To enable resource logging, you need the ID of a Traffic Manager profile. Retrieve the Traffic Manager profile that you want to enable resource logging for withGet-AzTrafficManagerProfile. The output includes the Traffic Manager profile's ID information.Get-AzTrafficManagerProfile -Name <TrafficManagerprofilename> -ResourceGroupName <resourcegroupname>
