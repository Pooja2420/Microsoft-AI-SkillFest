In this article, learn about network topologies and constraints in Oracle Database@Azure.
After you purchase an offer through Azure Marketplace and provision the Oracle Exadata infrastructure, the next step is to create your virtual machine cluster to host your instance of Oracle Exadata Database@Azure. The Oracle database clusters are connected to your Azure virtual network via a virtual network interface card (virtual NIC) from your delegated subnet (delegated toOracle.Database/networkAttachment).
Oracle.Database/networkAttachment
Supported topologies
The following table describes the network topologies that are supported by each configuration of network features for Oracle Database@Azure:
* You can overcome this limitation by using a site-to-site VPN.
Constraints
The following table describes required configurations of supported network features:
Note
If you want to configure a route table (UDR route) to control the routing of packets through a network virtual appliance or firewall destined to an Oracle Database@Azure instance from a source in the same VNet or a peered VNet, the UDR prefix must be more specific or equal to the delegated subnet size of the Oracle Database@Azure instance. If the UDR prefix is less specific than the delegated subnet size, it isn't effective.
For example, if your delegated subnet isx.x.x.x/24, you must configure your UDR tox.x.x.x/24(equal) orx.x.x.x/32(more specific). If you configure the UDR route to bex.x.x.x/16, undefined behaviors such as asymmetric routing can cause a network drop at the firewall.
x.x.x.x/24
x.x.x.x/24
x.x.x.x/32
x.x.x.x/16
