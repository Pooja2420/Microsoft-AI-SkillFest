Mainframe file replication and sync on Azure
Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
When you migrate an on-premises mainframe or midrange application to Azure, transferring the data is a primary consideration. Several modernization scenarios require replicating files to Azure quickly or maintaining synchronization between on-premises files and Azure files.
This article describes several processes for transferring files to Azure, converting and transforming file data, and storing the data on-premises and in Azure.
Architecture
The following diagram shows some of the options for replicating and syncing on-premises files to Azure:

Dataflow
Transfer files to Azure:The easiest way to transfer files on-premises or to Azure is by usingFile Transfer Protocol (FTP). You can host an FTP server on an Azure virtual machine (VM). A simple FTP job control language (JCL) sends files to Azure in binary format, which is essential to preserving mainframe and midrange computation and binary data types. You can store transmitted files in on-premises disks, Azure VM file storage, or Azure Blob Storage.You can also upload on-premises files to Blob Storage by using tools likeAzCopy.The Azure Data Factoryâ¯FTP/SFTP connector can also be used to transfer data from the mainframe system to Blob Storage. This method requires an intermediate VM on which a self-hosted integration runtime (SHIR) is installed.You can also find third-party tools inAzure Marketplaceto transfer files from mainframes to Azure.

Orchestrate, convert, and transform data:Azure can't read IBM Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) code page files in Azure VM disks or Blob Storage. To make these files compatible with Azure, Host Integration Server (HIS) converts them from EBCDIC to American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format.Copybooks define the data structure of COBOL, PL/I, and assembly language files. HIS converts these files to ASCII based on the copybook layouts.Before transferring data to Azure data stores, you might need to transform the data or use it for analytics. Data Factory can manage these extract-transform-load (ETL) and extract-load-transform (ELT) activities and store the data directly in Azure Data Lake Storage.For big data integrations, Azure Databricks and Azure Synapse Analytics can perform all transformation activities fast and effectively by using the Apache Spark engine to perform in-memory computations.
