This article explains how reservation permissions work and how users can view and manage Azure reservations in the Azure portal and with Azure PowerShell.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Who can manage a reservation by default
By default, the following users can view and manage reservations:
The person who buys a reservation and the account administrator of the billing subscription used to buy the reservation are added to the reservation order.
Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer Agreement billing administrators.
Users with elevated access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups
A Reservation administrator for reservations in their Microsoft Entra tenant (directory)
A Reservation reader has read-only access to reservations in their Microsoft Entra tenant (directory)
The reservation lifecycle is independent of an Azure subscription, so the reservation isn't a resource under the Azure subscription. Instead, it's a tenant-level resource with its own Azure RBAC permission separate from subscriptions. Reservations don't inherit permissions from subscriptions after the purchase.
View and manage reservations
If you're a billing administrator, use following steps to view and manage all reservations and reservation transactions in the Azure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portaland navigate toCost Management + Billing.If you're an EA admin, in the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then in the list of billing scopes, select one.If you're a Microsoft Customer Agreement billing profile owner, in the left menu, selectBilling profiles. In the list of billing profiles, select one.
If you're an EA admin, in the left menu, selectBilling scopesand then in the list of billing scopes, select one.
If you're a Microsoft Customer Agreement billing profile owner, in the left menu, selectBilling profiles. In the list of billing profiles, select one.
In the left menu, selectProducts + services>Reservations.
The complete list of reservations for your EA enrollment or billing profile is shown.
Billing administrators can take ownership of a reservation by selecting one or multiple reservations, selectingGrant accessand selectingGrant accessin the window that appears. For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, user should be in the same Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) as the reservation.
Add billing administrators
Add a user as billing administrator to an Enterprise Agreement or a Microsoft Customer Agreement in the Azure portal.
For an Enterprise Agreement, add users with theEnterprise Administratorrole to view and manage all reservation orders that apply to the Enterprise Agreement. Enterprise administrators can view and manage reservations inCost Management + Billing.Users with theEnterprise Administrator (read only)role can only view the reservation fromCost Management + Billing.Department admins and account owners can't view reservationsunlessthey're explicitly added to them using Access control (IAM). For more information, seeManaging Azure Enterprise roles.
Users with theEnterprise Administrator (read only)role can only view the reservation fromCost Management + Billing.
Department admins and account owners can't view reservationsunlessthey're explicitly added to them using Access control (IAM). For more information, seeManaging Azure Enterprise roles.
For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, users with the billing profile owner role or the billing profile contributor role can manage all reservation purchases made using the billing profile. Billing profile readers and invoice managers can view all reservations that are paid for with the billing profile. However, they can't make changes to reservations.
For more information, seeBilling profile roles and tasks.
View reservations with Azure RBAC access
If you purchased the reservation or you're added to a reservation, use the following steps to view and manage reservations in the Azure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
SelectAll Services>Reservationsto list reservations that you have access to.
Manage subscriptions and management groups with elevated access
You can elevate a user'saccess to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups.
After you have elevated access:
Navigate toAll Services>Reservationto see all reservations that are in the tenant.
To make modifications to the reservation, add yourself as an owner of the reservation order using Access control (IAM).
Grant access to individual reservations
Users who have owner access on the reservations and billing administrators can delegate access management for an individual reservation order in the Azure portal.
To allow other people to manage reservations, you have two options:
Delegate access management for an individual reservation order by assigning the Owner role to a user at the resource scope of the reservation order. If you want to give limited access, select a different role.For detailed steps, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.

Grant access with PowerShell
Users that have owner access for reservations orders, users with elevated access, andUser Access Administratorscan delegate access management for all reservation orders they have access to.
Access granted using PowerShell isn't shown in the Azure portal. Instead, you use theget-AzRoleAssignmentcommand in the following section to view assigned roles.
get-AzRoleAssignment
Assign the owner role for all reservations
Use the following Azure PowerShell script to give a user Azure RBAC access to all reservations orders in their Microsoft Entra tenant (directory).
Import-Module Az.Accounts
Import-Module Az.Resources
 
Connect-AzAccount -Tenant <TenantId>
 
$response = Invoke-AzRestMethod -Path /providers/Microsoft.Capacity/reservations?api-version=2020-06-01 -Method GET
 
$responseJSON = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-JSON
 
$reservationObjects = $responseJSON.value
 
foreach ($reservation in $reservationObjects)
{
  $reservationOrderId = $reservation.id.substring(0, 84)
  Write-Host "Assigning Owner role assignment to "$reservationOrderId
  New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope $reservationOrderId -ObjectId <ObjectId> -RoleDefinitionName Owner
}
Import-Module Az.Accounts
Import-Module Az.Resources
 
Connect-AzAccount -Tenant <TenantId>
 
$response = Invoke-AzRestMethod -Path /providers/Microsoft.Capacity/reservations?api-version=2020-06-01 -Method GET
 
$responseJSON = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-JSON
 
$reservationObjects = $responseJSON.value
 
foreach ($reservation in $reservationObjects)
{
  $reservationOrderId = $reservation.id.substring(0, 84)
  Write-Host "Assigning Owner role assignment to "$reservationOrderId
  New-AzRoleAssignment -Scope $reservationOrderId -ObjectId <ObjectId> -RoleDefinitionName Owner
}
When you use the PowerShell script to assign the ownership role and it runs successfully, a success message isnât returned.
