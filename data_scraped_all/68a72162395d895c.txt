Applies to:SQL Server on Azure VM
The SQL best practices assessment feature of the Azure portal identifies possible performance issues and evaluates that your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) is configured to follow best practices using therich rulesetprovided by theSQL Assessment API.
To learn more, watch this video onSQL best practices assessment:
Overview
Once the SQL best practices assessment feature is enabled, your SQL Server instance and databases are scanned to provide recommendations for things like indexes, deprecated features, enabled or missing trace flags, statistics, etc. Recommendations are surfaced to theSQL VM management pageof theAzure portal.
Assessment results are uploaded to yourLog Analytics workspaceusingAzure Monitor Agent (AMA). The AMA extension is installed to the SQL Server VM, if it isn't installed already, and AMA resources such asDCE,DCRare created and connected to the specified Log Analytics workspace.
Assessment run time depends on your environment (number of databases, objects, and so on), with a duration from a few minutes, up to an hour. Similarly, the size of the assessment result also depends on your environment. Assessment runs against your instance and all databases on that instance. In our testing, we observed that an assessment run can have up to 5-10% CPU impact on the machine. In these tests, the assessment was done while a TPC-C like application was running against the SQL Server.
Prerequisites
To use the SQL best practices assessment feature, you must have the following prerequisites:
Your SQL Server VM must be registered with theSQL Server IaaS extension.
ALog Analytics workspacein the same subscription as your SQL Server VM to upload assessment results to.
SQL Server 2012 or later.
Permissions
To enable SQL best practices assessments, you need the following permissions:
Virtual machine contributoron the underlying virtual machine resource.
Virtual machine contributoron the SQL virtual machines resource.
Log Analytics Contributoron the resource group that contains the Log Analytics workspace.
Readeron the resource group where the Azure Monitor Agent resources are created. Check the configuration option for the resource group when you enable the SQL best practices assessment feature.
Enable
You can enable SQL best practices assessments using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

SelectApplyto save your changes and deploy the Azure Monitor Agent to your SQL Server VM if it's not deployed already. An Azure portal notification tells you once the SQL best practices assessment feature is ready for your SQL Server VM.
To enable the SQL best practices assessments feature using the Azure CLI, use the following command example:
az sql vm update --enable-assessment true --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"
az sql vm update --enable-assessment true --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"
To disable the feature, use the following command:
# This will disable the feature including any set schedules
az sql vm update --enable-assessment false -g "myRg" -n "myVM"
# This will disable the feature including any set schedules
az sql vm update --enable-assessment false -g "myRg" -n "myVM"
Assess SQL Server VM
Assessments run:
On a schedule
On demand
Run scheduled assessment
You can configure assessment on a schedule using the Azure portal and the Azure CLI.
Azure portal
Azure CLI
If you set a schedule in the configuration pane, an assessment runs automatically at the specified date and time. ChooseConfigurationto modify your assessment schedule. Once you provide a new schedule, the previous schedule is overwritten.
To enable the feature and set a schedule for assessment runs using the Azure CLI, use the following command examples:
# Schedule is set to every 2 weeks starting on Sunday at 11 pm (VM OS time)
az sql vm update --assessment-weekly-interval 2 --assessment-day-of-week Sunday --assessment-start-time-local "23:00" --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"

# To schedule assessment for 2nd Sunday of each month at 11 pm (VM OS time)
az sql vm update --monthly-occurrence 2 --assessment-day-of-week Sunday --assessment-start-time-local "23:00" --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"
 
# To schedule assessment for the last Sunday of each month at 11 pm (VM OS time)
az sql vm update --monthly-occurrence -1 --assessment-day-of-week Sunday --assessment-start-time-local "23:00" --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"
# Schedule is set to every 2 weeks starting on Sunday at 11 pm (VM OS time)
az sql vm update --assessment-weekly-interval 2 --assessment-day-of-week Sunday --assessment-start-time-local "23:00" --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"

# To schedule assessment for 2nd Sunday of each month at 11 pm (VM OS time)
az sql vm update --monthly-occurrence 2 --assessment-day-of-week Sunday --assessment-start-time-local "23:00" --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"
 
# To schedule assessment for the last Sunday of each month at 11 pm (VM OS time)
az sql vm update --monthly-occurrence -1 --assessment-day-of-week Sunday --assessment-start-time-local "23:00" --workspace-name "myLAWorkspace" --workspace-rg "myLARg" -g "myRg" --agent-rg myRg2 -n "myVM"
To disable the schedule, run the following command:
# This will disable an existing schedule, however the feature will remain enabled. You can still run on-demand assessments.
az sql vm update --enable-assessment-schedule false -g "myRg" -n "myVM"
# This will disable an existing schedule, however the feature will remain enabled. You can still run on-demand assessments.
az sql vm update --enable-assessment-schedule false -g "myRg" -n "myVM"
Run on demand assessment
After the SQL best practices assessment feature is enabled for your SQL Server VM, it's possible to run an assessment on demand using the Azure portal, or the Azure CLI.
Azure portal
Azure CLI
To run an on-demand assessment by using the Azure portal, selectRun assessmentfrom the SQL best practices assessment pane of theSQL virtual machinesresource page in the Azure portal.
To run an on-demand assessment by using the Azure CLI, using the following command:
# This will start an on-demand assessment run. You can track progress of the run or view results on the SQL virtual machines resource via Azure Portal
az sql vm start-assessment -g "myRg" -n "myVM"
# This will start an on-demand assessment run. You can track progress of the run or view results on the SQL virtual machines resource via Azure Portal
az sql vm start-assessment -g "myRg" -n "myVM"
View results
TheAssessments resultssection of theSQL best practices assessmentspage shows a list of the most recent assessment runs. Each row displays the start time of a run and the status - scheduled, running, uploading results, completed, or failed. Each assessment run has two parts: evaluates your instance, and uploads the results to your Log Analytics workspace. The status field covers both parts. Assessment results are shown in Azure workbooks.
Access the assessment results Azure workbook in three ways:
Select theView latest successful assessment buttonon theSQL best practices assessmentspage.
Choose a completed run from theAssessment resultssection of theSQL best practices assessmentspage.
SelectView assessment resultsfrom theTop 10 recommendationssurfaced on theOverviewpage of your SQL VM resource page.
Once you have the workbook open, you can use the drop-down to select previous runs. You can view the results of a single run using theResultspage or review historical trends using theTrendspage.
Results page
TheResultspage organizes the recommendations using tabs for:
All: All recommendations from the current run
New: New recommendations (the delta from previous runs)
Resolved: Resolved recommendations from previous runs
Insights: Identifies the most recurring issues and the databases with the most issues.
The graph groups assessment results in different categories of severity - high, medium, low, and information. Select each category to see the list of recommendations, or search for key phrases in the search box. It's best to start with the most severe recommendations and go down the list.
The first grid shows you each recommendation and the number of instances in your environment that encountered that issue. When you select a row in the first grid, the second grid lists all the instances for that particular recommendation. If there's no selection in the first grid, the second grid shows all recommendations, which could potentially be a long list.  You can use the drop downs above the grid (Name, Severity, Tags, Check Id) to filter the results. You can also useExport to ExcelandOpen the last run query in the Logs viewoptions by selecting the small icons on the top right corner of each grid.
Thepassedsection of the graph identifies recommendations your system already follows.
View detailed information for each recommendation by selecting theMessagefield, such as a long description, and relevant online resources.
Trends page
There are three charts on theTrendspage to show changes over time: all issues, new issues, and resolved issues. The charts help you see your progress. Ideally, the number of recommendations should go down while the number of resolved issues goes up. The legend shows the average number of issues for each severity level. Hover over the bars to see the individual vales for each run.
If there are multiple runs in a single day, only the latest run is included in the graphs on theTrendspage.
Enable for all VMs in a subscription
You can use the Azure CLI to enable the SQL best practices assessment feature on all SQL Server VMs within a subscription. To do so, use the following example script:

}
Known issues
You may encounter some of the following known issues when using SQL best practices assessments.
Migrating to Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)
Previously, SQL best practices assessment feature used Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to upload assessments to Log Analytics workspace. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent has beenreplaced with the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA). To migrate existing SQL best practices assessments from MMA to AMA, you mustdeleteand thenregisteryour SQL Server VM with the extension again. Your existing results will still be available after assessments are enabled. If the MMA isn't being used by other services, you canremove it. Before you migrate, make sure Azure Monitor Log Analytics issupported in the regionwhere your SQL Server VM is deployed.
Failed to enable assessments
Refer to thedeployment historyof the resource group containing the SQL VM to view the error message associated with the failed action.
Failed to run an assessment
Check the status of the assessment run in the Azure portal. If the status is failed, select the status to view the error message. You can also sign into the VM and review detailed error messages for failed assessments in the extension log atC:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SqlIaaSAgent\2.0.X.Y, where 2.0.X.Y is the  version of the extension.
C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SqlIaaSAgent\2.0.X.Y
If you're having issues running an assessment:
Make sure your environment meets all theprerequisites.
Make sure the SQL IaaS Agent service is running on the VM and the SQL IaaS Agent extension is in a healthy state. If the SQL IaaS Agent extension is unhealthy,repair the extensionto address any issues, and upgrade it to the latest version without any SQL Server downtime.
If you see login failures forNT SERVICE\SqlIaaSExtensionQuery, make sure that account exists in SQL Server with theServer permission - CONTROL SERVERpermission.
NT SERVICE\SqlIaaSExtensionQuery
Server permission - CONTROL SERVER
Uploading result to Log Analytics workspace failed
This error indicates that the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) was unable to upload the results within the expected time frame.
If your results are failing to upload to the Log Analytics workspace, try the following:
Enable thesystem-assigned managed identityfor the virtual machine and then toenablethe best practices assessment feature once more.
If the issue persists, try the following:Validate the MMA extension isprovisioned correctly. Review theMMA troubleshooting guideforCustom logs.Add an outbound rule for port 443 in your Windows Firewall and Network Security Group (NSG).
Validate the MMA extension isprovisioned correctly. Review theMMA troubleshooting guideforCustom logs.
Add an outbound rule for port 443 in your Windows Firewall and Network Security Group (NSG).
Errors with incorrect TLS configuration using Log Analytics
The most common TLS error occurs when the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) extension can't establish an SSL handshake when connecting to the Log Analytics endpoint, which typically happens when TLS 1.0 is enforced by the registry or GPO at the OS level, but not updated for the .NET framework. If you've enforced TLS 1.0 or higher in Windows and disabled older SSL protocols, as described inSchannel-specific registry keys, you also need to make sure the .NET Framework isconfigured to use strong cryptography.
Unable to change the Log Analytics workspace after configuring SQL Assessment
After a VM is associated with a Log Analytics workspace, it can't be changed from the SQL virtual machine resource. This is to prevent Log Analytics from being used for other use cases. You can disconnect the VM by using the Log Analytics resource blade on the Virtual Machines page in the Azure portal.
Result expired due to Log Analytics workspace data retention
This indicates that results are no longer retained in the Log Analytics workspace, based on its retention policy. You canchange the retention periodfor the workspace.
