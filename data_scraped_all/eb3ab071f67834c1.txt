Azure AI Speech service offers advanced speech to text capabilities. This feature supports both real-time and batch transcription, providing versatile solutions for converting audio streams into text.
Core Features
The speech to text service offers the following core features:
Real-timetranscription: Instant transcription with intermediate results for live audio inputs.
Fast transcription: Fastest synchronous output for situations with predictable latency.
Batch transcription: Efficient processing for large volumes of prerecorded audio.
Custom speech: Models with enhanced accuracy for specific domains and conditions.
Real-time speech to text
Real-time speech to text transcribes audio as it's recognized from a microphone or file. It's ideal for applications requiring immediate transcription, such as:
Transcriptions, captions, or subtitles for live meetings: Real-time audio transcription for accessibility and record-keeping.
Diarization: Identifying and distinguishing between different speakers in the audio.
Pronunciation assessment: Evaluating and providing feedback on pronunciation accuracy.
Call center agents assist: Providing real-time transcription to assist customer service representatives.
Dictation: Transcribing spoken words into written text for documentation purposes.
Voice agents: Enabling interactive voice response systems to transcribe user queries and commands.
Real-time speech to text can be accessed via the Speech SDK, Speech CLI, and REST API, allowing integration into various applications and workflows.
Real-time speech to text is available via theSpeech SDK, theSpeech CLI, andSpeech to text REST API for short audio.
Fast transcription
Fast transcription API is used to transcribe audio files with returning results synchronously and faster than real-time audio. Use fast transcription in the scenarios that you need the transcript of an audio recording as quickly as possible with predictable latency, such as:
Quick audio or video transcription and subtitles: Quickly get a transcription of an entire video or audio file in one go.
Video translation: Immediately get new subtitles for a video if you have audio in different languages.
To get started with fast transcription, seeuse the fast transcription API.
Batch transcription API
Batch transcriptionis designed for transcribing large amounts of audio stored in files. This method processes audio asynchronously and is suited for:
Transcriptions, captions, or subtitles for prerecorded audio: Converting stored audio content into text.
Contact center post-call analytics: Analyzing recorded calls to extract valuable insights.
Diarization: Differentiating between speakers in recorded audio.
Batch transcription is available via:
Speech to text REST API: Facilitates batch processing with the flexibility of RESTful calls. To get started, seeHow to use batch transcriptionandBatch transcription samples.

Speech CLI: Supports both real-time and batch transcription, making it easy to manage transcription tasks. For Speech CLI help with batch transcriptions, run the following command:spx help batch transcription

Custom speech
Withcustom speech, you can evaluate and improve the accuracy of speech recognition for your applications and products. A custom speech model can be used forreal-time speech to text,speech translation, andbatch transcription.
Tip
Ahosted deployment endpointisn't required to use custom speech with theBatch transcription API. You can conserve resources if thecustom speech modelis only used for batch transcription. For more information, seeSpeech service pricing.
Out of the box, speech recognition utilizes a Universal Language Model as a base model that is trained with Microsoft-owned data and reflects commonly used spoken language. The base model is pretrained with dialects and phonetics representing various common domains. When you make a speech recognition request, the most recent base model for eachsupported languageis used by default. The base model works well in most speech recognition scenarios.
Custom speech allows you to tailor the speech recognition model to better suit your application's specific needs. This can be particularly useful for:
Improving recognition of domain-specific vocabulary: Train the model with text data relevant to your field.
Enhancing accuracy for specific audio conditions: Use audio data with reference transcriptions to refine the model.
For more information about custom speech, see thecustom speech overviewand thespeech to text REST APIdocumentation.
For details about customization options per language and locale, see thelanguage and voice support for the Speech servicedocumentation.
