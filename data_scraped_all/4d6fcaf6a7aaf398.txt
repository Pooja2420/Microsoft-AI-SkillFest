Thedatetimedata type represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day.
Values range from 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 0001 Anno Domini (Common Era) through 11:59:59 P.M., December 31, 9999 A.D. (C.E.) in the Gregorian calendar.
datetime
Time values are measured in 100-nanosecond units called ticks, and a particular date is the number of ticks since 12:00 midnight,
January 1, 0001 A.D. (C.E.) in the GregorianCalendar calendar (excluding ticks that would be added by leap seconds).
For example, a ticks value of 31241376000000000 represents the date, Friday, January 01, 0100 12:00:00 midnight.
This is sometimes called "a moment in linear time".
Thedatetimeanddatedata types are equivalent.
