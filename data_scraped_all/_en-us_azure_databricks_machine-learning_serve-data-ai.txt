Mosaic AI provides a unified platform for all parts of AI development, including serving data for AI applications.
Feature management
Databricks feature managementcreates a centralized repository that manages machine learning features throughout their lifecycle. It ensures features are consistent and easily accessible for both training and inference, promoting reuse and collaboration among data scientists and engineers.
Features governed through the Unity Catalog inherit the permissions of the data they were trained on and their lineage can be tracked back to the original data source for transparency and repeatability.
Vector Search
Mosaic AI Vector Searchis a vector index optimized for storing and retrieving embeddings. Embeddings are crucial for applications that require similarity searches, such as RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), recommendation systems, and image recognition.
