View and Download FHIR Metrics Data
You can view the metrics under Monitoring | Metrics from the portal. The metrics include Number of Requests, Average Latency, Number of Errors, Data Size, request units (RUs) Used, Number of requests that exceeded capacity, and Availability (in %). The Total Request Metrics provides the number of requests reaching the FHIR service. This means requests such as FHIR bundles are considered as single request for logging.
The following screenshot shows RUs used for a sample environment with few activities in the last seven days. You can download the data in JSON format.
