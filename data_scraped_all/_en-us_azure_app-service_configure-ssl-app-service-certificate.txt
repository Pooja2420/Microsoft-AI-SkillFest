This article shows how to create an App Service certificate and perform management tasks like renewing, synchronizing, and deleting certificates. Once you have an App Service certificate, you can then import it into an App Service app. An App Service certificate is a private certificate that's managed by Azure. It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options.
If you purchase an App Service certificate from Azure, Azure manages the following tasks:
Handles the purchase process from GoDaddy.
Performs domain verification of the certificate.
Maintains the certificate inAzure Key Vault.
Managescertificate renewal.
Synchronizes the certificate automatically with the imported copies in App Service apps.
Note
After you upload a certificate to an app, the certificate is stored in a deployment unit that's bound to the App Service plan's resource group, region, and operating system combination, internally called awebspace. That way, the certificate is accessible to other apps in the same resource group and region combination. Certificates uploaded or imported to App Service are shared with App Services in the same deployment unit.
Prerequisites
Create an App Service app. The app'sApp Service planmust be in the Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier. SeeScale up an appto update the tier.
Note
Currently, App Service certificates aren't supported in Azure national clouds.
Buy and configure an App Service certificate
Go to theCreate App Service certificate pageto start the purchase.NoteApp Service Certificates purchased from Azure are issued by GoDaddy. For some domains, you must explicitly allow GoDaddy as a certificate issuer by creating aCAA domain recordwith the value0 issue godaddy.com.

To configure the certificate, use the following table. When you're done, selectReview + Create, and then selectCreate.SettingDescriptionSubscriptionThe Azure subscription to associate with the certificate.Resource GroupThe resource group that will contain the certificate. You can either create a new resource group or select the same resource group as your App Service app.SKUDetermines the type of certificate to create, either a standard certificate or awildcard certificate.Naked domain hostnameSpecify the root domain. The issued certificate provides security forboththe root domain and thewwwsubdomain. In the issued certificate, theCommon Namefield specifies the root domain, and theSubject Alternative Namefield specifies thewwwdomain. To provide security for only a subdomain, specify the fully qualified domain name for the subdomain, for example,mysubdomain.contoso.com.Certificate nameThe friendly name for your App Service certificate.Enable auto renewalSelect whether to automatically renew the certificate before expiration. Each renewal extends the certificate expiration by one year. The cost is charged to your subscription.

Key Vaultis an Azure service that helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services. For App Service certificates, we recommend that you use Key Vault. After you finish the certificate purchase process, you must complete a few more steps before you start using the certificate.
On theApp Service Certificates page, select the certificate. On the certificate menu, selectCertificate Configuration>Step 1: Store.

If you create a new vault, set up the vault based on the following table, and make sure to use the same subscription and resource group as your App Service app.SettingDescriptionResource groupRecommended: The same resource group as your App Service certificate.Key vault nameA unique name that uses only alphanumeric characters and dashes.RegionThe same location as your App Service app.Pricing tierFor information, seeAzure Key Vault pricing details.Days to retain deleted vaultsThe number of days, after deletion, that objects remain recoverable. (SeeAzure Key Vault soft-delete overview.) Set a value between 7 and 90.Purge protectionEnabling this option forces all deleted objects to remain in soft-deleted state for the entire duration of the retention period.
If you create a new vault, set up the vault based on the following table, and make sure to use the same subscription and resource group as your App Service app.

Important
With the Standard certificate, you get a certificate for the requested top-level domainandthewwwsubdomain, for example,contoso.comandwww.contoso.com. However, App Service Verification and Manual Verification both use HTML page verification, which doesn't support thewwwsubdomain when you issue, rekey, or renew a certificate. For the Standard certificate, use Domain Verification and Mail Verification to include thewwwsubdomain with the requested top-level domain in the certificate.

Once your certificate is domain-verified,you're ready to import it into an App Service app.
Renew an App Service certificate
By default, App Service certificates have a one-year validity period. Before the expiration date, you can automatically or manually renew App Service certificates in one-year increments. The renewal process effectively gives you a new App Service certificate with the expiration date extended to one year from the existing certificate's expiration date.
Note
Starting September 23 2021, if you haven't verified the domain in the last 395 days, App Service certificates require domain verification during a renew, auto-renew, or rekey process. The new certificate order remains in "pending issuance" mode during the renew, auto-renew, or rekey process until you complete the domain verification.
Unlike the free App Service managed certificate, purchased App Service certificates don't have automated domain re-verification. Failure to verify domain ownership results in failed renewals. For more information about how to verify your App Service certificate, reviewConfirm domain ownership.
The renewal process requires that the service principal for App Service has the required permissions on your key vault. These permissions are set up for you when you import an App Service certificate through the Azure portal. Make sure that you don't remove these permissions from your key vault.
To change the automatic renewal setting for your App Service certificate at any time, on theApp Service Certificates page, select the certificate.

Rekey an App Service certificate
If you think your certificate's private key is compromised, you can rekey your certificate. This action rotates the certificate with a new certificate issued from the certificate authority.
Note
Starting September 23 2021, if you haven't verified the domain in the last 395 days, App Service certificates require domain verification during a renew, auto-renew, or rekey process. The new certificate order remains in "pending issuance" mode during the renew, auto-renew, or rekey process until you complete the domain verification.

Export an App Service certificate
Because an App Service certificate is aKey Vault secret, you can export a copy as a PFX file, which you can use for other Azure services or outside of Azure.
Important
The exported certificate is an unmanaged artifact. App Service doesn't sync such artifacts when the App Service Certificate isrenewed. You must export and install the renewed certificate where necessary.

The downloaded PFX file is a raw PKCS12 file that contains both the public and private certificates and has an import password that's an empty string. You can locally install the file by leaving the password field empty. You can'tupload the file as-is into App Servicebecause the file isn'tpassword protected.
Use Azure Advisor for App Service certificate
App Service certificate is integrated withAzure Advisorto provide reliability recommendations for when your certificate requires domain verification. You must verify domain ownership for your certificate during renew, auto-renew, or rekey process if you haven't verified the domain in the last 395 days. To ensure you do not miss any certificate that requires verification or risk any certificate from expiring, you can utilize Azure Advisor to view and set up alerts for App Service certificate.
View Advisor recommendation
To view Advisor recommendation for App Service certificate:
Navigate to theAzure Advisor page.
