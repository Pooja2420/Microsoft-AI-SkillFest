Work items can live forever in your work tracking data store. You never have to delete them. However, you might want to set up a work item management process for one of the following actions:
Note
You can't archive work items or projects at this time.
For information about the Azure Artifacts Recycle Bin, seeDelete and recover packages.
To move a work item from one project to another, or to change the work item type, seeMove work items and change work item type.

Note
Users withStakeholderaccess for a public project have full access to all work tracking features just like users withBasicaccess. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.
Remove or delete multiple work items
You can act on individual work items or bulk modify several work items.
From the web portal, you can multi-select several work items from a backlog or query results page. You can also do a bulk update using the associated feature. To delete or restore several work items at the same time, seeModify work items in bulk.
You can also delete or destroy work items in batch with a REST API. For more information, seeWork Items - Delete.
Note
This feature is available starting in Azure DevOps Server 2022.1.

Remove work items
By changing theStateof a work item toRemoved, you effectively remove it from a backlog or board view: product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs, boards, and Taskboards. TheRemovedstate corresponds to theRemovedworkflow category state. If you define custom workflow states, any state you map to theRemovedworkflow category state act in a similar way. For more information, seeCustomize the workflow.

To cause removed items to not show up in queries, you must add a clause that filters on theStatefield.
Note
TheRemovedstate isn't supported with the Basic process. It is only supported with the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI process work item types. The Basic process is available when you add a project to Azure DevOps Services orAzure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1.

Delete work items
Deleted work items don't appear in your backlogs, boards, or queries. When you delete an item, it goes to theRecycle Bin. You can restore it from there if you change your mind. To delete a test case, test plan, or other test-related work item types, seeDelete test artifacts.
You can delete work items in one of the following ways:
The work item form
TheWork ItemspageMore Actionsmenu
The board cardcontext menu
A backlog or query results page

Note
Deleted test artifacts don't appear in theRecycle Binand can't be restored. When you delete a test artifact, all of its associated child items, such as child test suites, test points across all configurations, testers, test results history, and other associated history also get deleted. The underlying test case work item doesn't get deleted.

Delete or destroy work items from the command line
You can delete or destroy a work item with theaz boards work-item deletecommand. To get started, seeGet started with Azure DevOps CLI.
Note
You can restoredeletedwork items, but you can't restoredestroyedwork items.
az boards work-item delete --id
                           [--destroy]
                           [--org]
                           [--project]
                           [--yes]
az boards work-item delete --id
                           [--destroy]
                           [--org]
                           [--project]
                           [--yes]
id: Required. The ID of the work item.
destroy: Optional. Permanently delete this work item.
org: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization usingaz devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL. Required if not configured as default or picked up usinggit config. Example:--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/.
az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL
git config
--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/
project: Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project usingaz devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID. Required if not configured as default or picked up usinggit config.
az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID
git config
yes: Optional. Don't prompt for confirmation.
The following command permanently deletes the bug with the ID 864 and doesn't prompt you for confirmation.
az boards work-item delete --id 864 --destroy --yes
az boards work-item delete --id 864 --destroy --yes
Delete and restore processes
When you delete a work item, Azure DevOps does the following actions:
Generates a new revision of the work item
Updates theChanged By/Changed Datefields to support traceability
Preserves the work item completely, including all field assignments, attachments, tags, and links
Causes the work item to become nonqueryable and, as such, doesn't appear in any work tracking experience, query result, or report
Updates charts correctly. The CFD, velocity, burndown, and lightweight charts are updated to remove deleted work items
Removes work tracking extensions
Preserves trend data except for the latest value
Removes the work item from the data warehouse/cube similar to as if it was permanently removed
When you restore a work item, Azure DevOps does the following actions:
Causes a new revision of the work item to be made
Updates theChanged By/Changed Datefields to support traceability
Becomes queryable
All fields remain unchanged
History contains two new revisions, one for deletion, and one for restore
Reattaches work tracking extensions
Updates charts correctly. The CFD, velocity, burndown, and lightweight charts are updated to include the restored work items
Restores trend data
Adds the work item back to the data warehouse/cube
Sets the area or iteration path fields to the root node if the previous area path or iteration paths were deleted
Use a REST API to delete, restore, and destroy work items
To programmatically delete, restore, and destroy work items, see one of the following REST API resources:
Recycle bin REST API Reference
Work Items - Delete REST API Reference
