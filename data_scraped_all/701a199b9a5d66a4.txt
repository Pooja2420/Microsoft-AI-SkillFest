You can create a remote desktop connection to a virtual machine (VM) running Windows in Azure.
To connect to a Windows VM from a Mac, you will need to install an RDP client for Mac such asMicrosoft Remote Desktop.
Prerequisites
In order to connect to a Windows Virtual Machine via RDP you need TCP connectivity to the machine on the port where Remote Desktop service is listening (3389 by default). You can validate an appropriate port is open for RDP using the troubleshooter or by checking manually in your VM settings. To check if the TCP port is open (assuming default):On the page for the VM, selectNetworkingfrom the left menu.On theNetworkingpage, check to see if there is a rule which allows TCP on port 3389 from the IP address of the computer you are using to connect to the VM. If the rule exists, you can move to the next section.If there isn't a rule, add one by selectingAdd Inbound port rule.From theServicedropdown selectRDP.EditPriorityandSourceif necessaryForName, typePort_3389When finished, selectAddYou should now have an RDP rule in the table of inbound port rules.

Your VM must have a public IP address. To check if your VM has a public IP address, selectOverviewfrom the left menu and look at theNetworkingsection. If you see an IP address next toPublic IP address, then your VM has a public IP. To learn more about adding a public IP address to an existing VM, seeAssociate a public IP address to a virtual machine

Verify your VM is running. On the Overview tab, in the essentials section, verify the status of the VM is Running. To start the VM, selectStartat the top of the page.

Connect to the virtual machine
Follow these steps:
Go to theAzure portalto connect to a VM. Search for and selectVirtual machines.
Go to theAzure portalto connect to a VM. Search for and selectVirtual machines.
Select the virtual machine from the list.
Select the virtual machine from the list.
At the beginning of the virtual machine page, selectConnect.
At the beginning of the virtual machine page, selectConnect.
On theConnect to virtual machinepage, selectRDP, and then select the appropriateIP addressandPort number. In most cases, the default IP address and port should be used. SelectDownload RDP File. If the VM has a just-in-time policy set, you first need to select theRequest accessbutton to request access before you can download the RDP file. For more information about the just-in-time policy, seeManage virtual machine access using the just in time policy.

Open the downloaded RDP file and selectConnectwhen prompted. You will get a warning that the.rdpfile is from an unknown publisher. This is expected. In theRemote Desktop Connectionwindow, selectConnectto continue.

In theWindows Securitywindow, selectMore choicesand thenUse a different account. Enter the credentials for an account on the virtual machine and then selectOK.Local account: This is usually the local account user name and password that you specified when you created the virtual machine. In this case, the domain is the name of the virtual machine and it is entered asvmname\username.Domain joined VM: If the VM belongs to a domain, enter the user name in the formatDomain\Username. The account also needs to either be in the Administrators group or have been granted remote access privileges to the VM.Domain controller: If the VM is a domain controller, enter the user name and password of a domain administrator account for that domain.

SelectYesto verify the identity of the virtual machine and finish logging on.TipIf theConnectbutton in the portal is grayed-out and you are not connected to Azure via anExpress RouteorSite-to-Site VPNconnection, you will need to create and assign your VM a public IP address before you can use RDP. For more information, seePublic IP addresses in Azure.

Tip
If theConnectbutton in the portal is grayed-out and you are not connected to Azure via anExpress RouteorSite-to-Site VPNconnection, you will need to create and assign your VM a public IP address before you can use RDP. For more information, seePublic IP addresses in Azure.
Connect to the virtual machine using PowerShell
If you are using PowerShell and have the Azure PowerShell  module installed you may also connect using theGet-AzRemoteDesktopFilecmdlet, as shown below.
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile
This example will immediately launch the RDP connection, taking you through similar prompts as above.Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -Launch
This example will immediately launch the RDP connection, taking you through similar prompts as above.
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -Launch
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -Launch
You may also save the RDP file for future use.Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -LocalPath "C:\Path\to\folder"
You may also save the RDP file for future use.
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -LocalPath "C:\Path\to\folder"
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -LocalPath "C:\Path\to\folder"
