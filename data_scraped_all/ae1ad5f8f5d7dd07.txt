What is Conditional Access?
The modern security perimeter extends beyond an organization's network to include user and device identity. Organizations can use identity-driven signals as part of their access control decisions. You can useMicrosoft Entra Conditional Accessto bring signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies.
Conditional Access policies at their simplest are like if-then statements. If a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. For example, a data engineer wants to access Azure Data Explorer but is required to do multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access it.
In the following example, you'll learn how to configure a Conditional Access policy that enforces MFA for selected users using the Azure Data Explorer web UI. You can use the same steps to create other policies to meet your organization's security requirements.
Prerequisites
Using this feature requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license. To find the right license for your requirements, seeCompare available features of Microsoft Entra ID.
Note
Conditional Access policies are only applied to Azure Data Explorer's data administration operations and don't affect any resource administration operations.
