By default, all administrators can invite new users to their Azure DevOps organization. Disabling this policy prevents Team and Project Administrators from inviting new users. However, Project Collection Administrators (PCAs) can still add new users to the organization regardless of the policy status. Additionally, if a user is already a member of the organization, Project and Team Administrators can add that user to specific projects.
Prerequisites
Turn off policy
Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}).
Sign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}).
https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}
SelectOrganization settings.
SelectOrganization settings.

Under Security, selectPolicies, and then move the toggle tooff.

Now, only Project Collection Administrators can invite new users to Azure DevOps.
Note
Project and Team Administrators can directly add users to their projects through the permissions blade. However, if they attempt to add users through theAdd Usersbutton located in theOrganization settings>Userssection, it's not visible to them.
Adding a user directly throughProject settings>Permissionsdoesn't result in the user appearing automatically in theOrganization settings>Userslist. For the user to be reflected in the Users list, they must sign in to the system.
