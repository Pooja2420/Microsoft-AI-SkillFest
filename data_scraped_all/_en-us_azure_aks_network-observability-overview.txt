This article describes:
The types of monitoring data you can collect for this service.
Ways to analyze that data.
Note
If you're already familiar with this service and/or Azure Monitor and just want to know how to analyze monitoring data, see theAnalyzesection near the end of this article.
When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you need to monitor and get alerts for your system. The Azure Monitor service collects and aggregates metrics and logs from every component of your system. Azure Monitor provides you with a view of availability, performance, and resilience, and notifies you of issues. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, or client libraries to set up and view monitoring data.
For more information on Azure Monitor, see theAzure Monitor overview.
For more information on how to monitor Azure resources in general, seeMonitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor.
Important
Kubernetes is a complex distributed system with many moving parts. Monitoring at multiple levels is required. Although AKS is a managed Kubernetes service, the same rigor around monitoring at multiple levels is still required. This article provides high level information and best practices for monitoring an AKS cluster.
For detailed monitoring of the complete Kubernetes stack, seeMonitor Kubernetes clusters using Azure services and cloud native tools.
For collecting metric data from Kubernetes clusters, seeAzure Monitor managed service for Prometheus.
For collecting logs in Kubernetes clusters, seeAzure Monitor features for Kubernetes monitoring.
For data visualization, seeAzure WorkbooksandMonitor your Azure services in Grafana.
Insights
Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are calledinsights, and you can find them in theInsights Hubof Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.
Azure Monitor Container insights collect custom metrics for nodes, pods, containers, and persistent volumes. For more information, seeMetrics collected by Container insights.
Azure Monitor Application Insightsis used for application performance monitoring (APM). To enable Application Insights with code changes, seeEnable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry. To enable Application Insights without code changes, seeAKS autoinstrumentation. For more information on instrumentation, seedata collection basics.
Monitoring data
AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described inMonitoring data from Azure resources. SeeMonitoring AKS data referencefor detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS.Other Azure services and featurescollect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

Resource types
Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine isMicrosoft.Compute/virtualMachines. For a list of services and their associated resource types, seeResource providers.
Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also callednamespaces. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.
For more information about the resource types for AKS, seeAzure Kubernetes Service monitoring data reference.
Data storage
For Azure Monitor:
Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.
You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.
Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage,hosted partner systems, andnon-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs.
For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, seeAzure Monitor data platform.

Azure Monitor platform metrics
Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:
Individually defined for each namespace.
Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
Used to track the performance of a resource over time.
Collection:Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.
Routing:You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check theDS exportsetting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.
For more information, see theMetrics diagnostic setting.
To configure diagnostic settings for a service, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, seeSupported metrics in Azure Monitor.
For a list of available metrics for AKS, seeAzure Kubernetes Service monitoring data reference.
Metrics play an important role in cluster monitoring, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in the AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out of the box metrics server installed in kube-system namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all Kubernetes nodes served by Kubelet. You should also enable Azure Managed Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, such as object state of Deployments. For more information, seeCollect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster.
List of default Prometheus metrics
AKS also exposes metrics from critical Control Plane components such as API server, ETCD, Scheduler through Azure Managed Prometheus. This feature is currently in preview. For more information, seeMonitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) control plane metrics (preview). A subset of Control Plane metrics for the API server and ETCD are available for free throughAzure Monitor platform metrics. These metrics are collected by default and can be used for creating metrics-based alerts.

Non-Azure Monitor based metrics
This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
The following Azure services and features of Azure Monitor can be used for extra monitoring of your Kubernetes clusters. You can enable these features during AKS cluster creation from the Integrations tab in the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Terraform, Azure Policy, or onboard your cluster to them later. Each of these features might incur cost, so refer to the pricing information for each before you enabled them.
Monitor AKS control plane metrics (preview)
AKS also exposes metrics from critical Control Plane components such as API server, ETCD, Scheduler through Azure Managed Prometheus. This feature is currently in preview.

A subset of Control Plane metrics for the API server and ETCD are available for free throughAzure Monitor platform metrics. These metrics are collected by default and can be used for creating metrics-based alerts.

Azure Monitor resource logs
Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.
Collection:Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create adiagnostic settingand route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.
Routing:The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, seeAzure resource logsandResource log destinations.
For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, seeDiagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, seeSupported resource logs in Azure Monitor.
All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined inAzure Monitor resource log schema.
For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the log schemas for AKS, seeAzure Kubernetes Service monitoring data reference.
AKS control plane/resource logs
Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented asresource logsin Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to one or more locations. You typically send them to a Log Analytics workspace, which is where most of the data for Container insights is stored.
SeeCreate diagnostic settingsfor the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed inAKS monitoring data reference.
Important
There can be substantial cost when collecting resource logs for AKS, particularly forkube-auditlogs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:
Disable kube-audit logging when not required.
Enable collection fromkube-audit-admin, which excludes the get and list audit events.
Enable resource-specific logs as described here and configureAKSAudittable asbasic logs.
AKSAudit
SeeMonitor Kubernetes clusters using Azure services and cloud native toolsfor further recommendations andCost optimization and Azure Monitorfor further strategies to reduce your monitoring costs.
AKS supports eitherAzure diagnostics modeorresource-specific modefor resource logs. This mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to theAzureDiagnostics table, while resource-specific mode sends data toAKS Audit,AKS Audit Admin, andAKS Control Planeas shown in the table atResource logs.
Resource-specific mode is recommended for AKS for the following reasons:
Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables dedicated to AKS.
Supports configuration asbasic logsfor significant cost savings.
For more information on the difference between collection modes including how to change an existing setting, seeSelect the collection mode.
Note
It is also possible to configure Diagnostic settings through the CLI. In these cases, it is not guaranteed to work successfully as it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. Please make sure to check the diagnostic settings of the cluster to reflect after configuring it.

Important
When you selectLogsfrom the menu for an AKS cluster, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current cluster. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other clusters or data from other Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu. SeeLog query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analyticsfor details.
If thediagnostic setting for your clusteruses Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in theAzureDiagnosticstable. You can distinguish different logs with theCategorycolumn. For a description of each category, seeAKS reference resource logs.
To access a set of prebuilt queries in the Log Analytics workspace, see theLog Analytics queries interfaceand select resource typeKubernetes Services. For a list of common queries for Container insights, seeContainer insights queries.
AKS data plane/Container Insights logs
Container Insights collect various types of telemetry data from containers and Kubernetes clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see theAzure Monitor table reference. All these tables are available forlog queries.
Cost optimization settingsallow you to customize and control the metrics data collected through the container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection throughAzure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCR). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of container insights. Container insights Collected Data can be customized through the Azure portal, using the following options. Selecting any options other thanAll (Default)leads to the container insights experience becoming unavailable.
TheLogs and eventsgrouping captures the logs from theContainerLogorContainerLogV2,KubeEvents,KubePodInventorytables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enableAzure Monitor managed service Prometheus for Prometheusfrom your AKS cluster and to useAzure Managed Grafanafor data visualization. For more information, seeManage an Azure Monitor workspace.
Azure Monitor Container Insights provides a schema for container logs known as ContainerLogV2, which is the recommended option. This format includes the following fields to facilitate common queries for viewing data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:
ContainerName
PodName
PodNamespace
In addition, this schema is compatible withBasic Logsdata plan, which offers a low-cost alternative to standard analytics logs. The Basic log data plan lets you save on the cost of ingesting and storing high-volume verbose logs in your Log Analytics workspace for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing. It doesn't affect costs for analytics and alerts. For more information, seeManage tables in a Log Analytics workspace.
ContainerLogV2 is the recommended approach and is the default schema for customers onboarding container insights with Managed Identity Auth using ARM, Bicep, Terraform, Policy, and Azure portal. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's Data Collection Rule (DCR) or ConfigMap, seeEnable the ContainerLogV2 schema.
Azure activity log
The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.
Collection:Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.
Routing:You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, seeOverview of the Azure activity log.

Monitoring overview page in Azure portal
TheMonitoringtab on theOverviewpage for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in themetrics explorer.
TheMonitoringtab also includes links toManaged PrometheusandContainer Insightsfor the cluster. If you need to enable these tools, you can enable them here. You might also see a banner at the top of the screen recommending that you enable other features to improve monitoring of your cluster.
Tip
You can access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription by selectingAzure Monitoron the Azure portal home page.

Kusto queries
You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).
Important
When you selectLogsfrom the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu. SeeLog query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analyticsfor details.
For a list of common queries for any service, see theLog Analytics queries interface.
Alerts
Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, seeAzure Monitor alerts.
There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, seeSample log alert queries. TheAzure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).
The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, seeCommon alert schema.
Types of alerts
You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, seeChoose the right monitoring alert type.
The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:
Metric alertsevaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.
Log alertsallow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.
Activity log alertstrigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.
Some Azure services also supportsmart detection alerts,Prometheus alerts, orrecommended alert rules.
For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, seeMonitor multiple resources with one alert rule.
Recommended alert rules
For some Azure services, you canenable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules.
The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:
The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.
Note
Recommended alert rules are available for:
Virtual machines
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
Log Analytics workspaces
Prometheus metrics based alerts
When youenable collection of Prometheus metricsfor your cluster, you can download a collection ofrecommended Prometheus alert rules. This download includes the following rules:
SeeHow to create log alerts from Container InsightsandHow to query logs from Container Insights.Log alertscan measure two different things, which can be used to monitor in different scenarios:
Result count: Counts the number of rows returned by the query and can be used to work with events such as Windows event logs, Syslog, and application exceptions.
Calculation of a value: Makes a calculation based on a numeric column and can be used to include any number of resources. An example is CPU percentage.
Depending on the alerting scenario required, log queries need to be created comparing a DateTime to the present time by using thenowoperator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, seeCreate log alerts from Container insights.
now
AKS alert rules
The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are just examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in theAzure Kubernetes Service monitoring data reference.
Advisor recommendations
For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the serviceOverviewpage in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert inAdvisor recommendationsunderMonitoringin the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.
For more information on Azure Advisor, seeAzure Advisor overview.
Note
If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service,Azure Monitor application insightsmight offer more types of alerts.
Node Network Metrics
Node Network Metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights into your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance degradation.
Starting with Kubernetes version 1.29, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters with Azure Monitor enabled.
The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). These metrics can be easily visualized using the Managed Grafana dashboard, accessible under Azure Managed Prometheus > Kubernetes > Networking > Clusters.
Node-Level Metrics
The following metrics are aggregated per node. All metrics include labels:
