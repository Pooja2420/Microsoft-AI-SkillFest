In this quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus topic and then create subscriptions to that topic.
What are Service Bus topics and subscriptions?
Service Bus topics and subscriptions support apublish/subscribemessaging communication model. When you use topics and subscriptions, components of a distributed application don't communicate directly with each other; instead they exchange messages via a topic, which acts as an intermediary.

In contrast with Service Bus queues, in which each message is processed by a single consumer, topics and subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication, using a publish/subscribe pattern. It's possible to register multiple subscriptions to a topic. When a message is sent to a topic, it's then made available to each subscription to handle/process independently. A subscription to a topic resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of the messages that were sent to the topic. You can optionally register filter rules for a topic on subscriptions, which allows you to filter or restrict which messages to a topic are received by which topic subscriptions.
Service Bus topics and subscriptions enable you to scale to process a large number of messages across a large number of users and applications.
Create a namespace in the Azure portal
To begin using Service Bus messaging entities in Azure, you must first create a namespace with a name that is unique across Azure. A namespace provides a scoping container for Service Bus resources (queues, topics, etc.) within your application.
To create a namespace:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate to theAll servicespage.
Navigate to theAll servicespage.
On the left navigation bar, selectIntegrationfrom the list of categories, hover the mouse overService Bus, and then select+button on the Service Bus tile.

In theBasicstag of theCreate namespacepage, follow these steps:ForSubscription, choose an Azure subscription in which to create the namespace.ForResource group, choose an existing resource group, or create a new one.Enter aname for the namespace. The namespace name should adhere to the following naming conventions:The name must be unique across Azure. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available.The name length is at least 6 and at most 50 characters.The name can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens-.The name must start with a letter and end with a letter or number.The name doesn't end with-sbor-mgmt.ForLocation, choose the region in which your namespace should be hosted.ForPricing tier, select the pricing tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium) for the namespace. For this quickstart, selectStandard.If you selectPremiumtier, select whether you can enablegeo-replicationfor the namespace. The Geo-Replication feature ensures that the metadata and data of a namespace are continuously replicated from a primary region to one or more secondary regions.ImportantIf you want to usetopics and subscriptions, choose either Standard or Premium. Topics/subscriptions aren't supported in the Basic pricing tier.If you selected thePremiumpricing tier, specify the number ofmessaging units. The premium tier provides resource isolation at the CPU and memory level so that each workload runs in isolation. This resource container is called a messaging unit. A premium namespace has at least one messaging unit. You can select 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 messaging units for each Service Bus Premium namespace.

In this article, you created a Service Bus namespace, a topic in the namespace, and three subscriptions to the topic. To learn how to publish messages to the topic and subscribe for messages from a subscription, see one of the following quickstarts in thePublish and subscribe for messagessection.
