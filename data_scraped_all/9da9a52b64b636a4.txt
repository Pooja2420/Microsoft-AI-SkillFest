This article outlines the process to prepare your organization for AI adoption. You learn how to select the right AI solutions, prepare your data, and ground your approach in responsible AI principles. A well-planned AI strategy aligns with your business objectives and ensures that AI projects contribute to overall success.

Identify AI use cases
AI enhances individual efficiency and improves business processes. Generative AI fosters productivity and enhances customer experiences. Nongenerative AI, such as machine learning, is ideal for analyzing structured data and automating repetitive tasks. With this understanding, identify areas across your business where AI could add value.
Look for automation opportunities.Identify processes suitable for automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Focus on repetitive tasks, data-heavy operations, or areas with high error rates where AI can have a significant effect.

Gather customer feedback.Use customer feedback to uncover use cases that would have an impact on customer satisfaction when automated with AI.

Explore industry use cases.Research how similar organizations or industries use AI to solve problems or enhance operations. Use tools like theAI architecturesin the Azure Architecture Center for inspiration and to evaluate which approaches might suit your needs.

Set AI targets.For each identified use case, clearly define the goal (general purpose), objective (desired outcome), and success metric (quantifiable measure). These elements serve as benchmarks to guide your AI adoption and measure success. For more information, seeexample AI strategy.

Define an AI technology strategy
Select AI technologies that align closely with your organization's skills, available data, and budget. Microsoft offers software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). These services provide different levels of customization andshared responsibility. To guide your decision, use the following AI decision tree and guidance.

Buy AI with software services (SaaS)
Microsoft provides SaaS generative AI solutions known as Copilots, designed to enhance productivity with minimal technical expertise required. See the following table for more information.
Build AI workloads with Azure platforms (PaaS)
Azure provides multiple PaaS options tailored to your AI goals, skill set, and data needs. These platforms cater to various levels of technical expertise. Review thepricing pagesand use theAzure pricing calculatorfor cost estimates.
Bring AI models with infrastructure services (IaaS)
For greater customization and control, use Azure's IaaS solutions such asAzure Virtual Machines through CycleCloudandAzure Kubernetes Service. These solutions enable training and deployment of custom AI models. Refer to the relevantpricing pagesand theAzure pricing calculator.
Define an AI data strategy
Create a data strategy tailored to your AI use cases. Identify acceptable data sources, workload types (internal vs. external), and implement guidelines ensuring the responsible use of AI. Follow these steps:
Establish data governance.Restrict internet-facing ("Online") workloads to public data only. Allow internal ("Corporate") workloads to use business data and maintain defined data access boundaries. UseMicrosoft Purviewto govern data. Reference theData management landing zonefor architecture guidance.

Prepare for data scalability.Anticipate the volume, velocity, and variety of data required. Choose flexible architectures capable of scaling according to demand. For an architecture, seeData landing zone.

Plan the data lifecycle.Develop clear guidelines for managing data throughout its lifecycle:Data collection:Identify data sources such as databases, APIs, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, third-party data, or Azure Data Factory for ingestion. Maintaindata lineagewithMicrosoft FabricorMicrosoft Purview.Data storage:Recommend storage solutions aligned with data type and scale, including structured, unstructured, and real-time scenarios.Data processing:Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT pipelines to ensure data quality and readiness. Utilize tools likeOne Lake shortcutsorMirroringin Microsoft Fabric.Data auditing.Implement regular audits to identify and mitigate bias within AI datasets. Use tools in theResponsible AI Dashboardfor analyzing and auditing data and model outputs.

Define a responsible AI strategy
Understand your responsibilities in ensuring AI solutions remain trustworthy, ethical, and beneficial to all users. Responsibilities differ based on the specific AI technologies you use.
Establish AI accountability.Assign a dedicated individual or team to monitor, manage, and respond to changes in AI technology and regulatory requirements.

Example AI strategy
This example AI strategy is based on a fictional company, Contoso. Contoso operates a customer-facing e-commerce platform and employs sales representatives who need tools to forecast business data. The company also manages product development and inventory for production. Its sales channels include both private companies and highly regulated public sector agencies.
