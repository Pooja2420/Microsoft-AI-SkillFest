The Azure-managed Default Rule Set (DRS) in the Application Gateway web application firewall (WAF) actively protect web applications from common vulnerabilities and exploits. These rule sets, managed by Azure, receive updates as necessary to guard against new attack signatures. The default rule set also incorporates the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules. The Microsoft Intelligence team collaborates in writing these rules, ensuring enhanced coverage, specific vulnerability patches, and improved false positive reduction.
You also have the option of using rules that are defined based on the OWASP core rule set 3.2 (CRS 3.2).
You can disable rules individually, or set specific actions for each rule. This article lists the current rules and rule sets available. If a published rule set requires an update, we'll document it here.
Note
When you change a ruleset version in a WAF Policy, any existing customizations you made to your ruleset will be reset to the defaults for the new ruleset. See:Upgrading or changing ruleset version.
Default rule set 2.1
Default rule set (DRS) 2.1 is baselined off the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.3.2 and includes additional proprietary protections rules developed by Microsoft Threat Intelligence team and updates to signatures to reduce false positives. It also supports transformations beyond just URL decoding.
DRS 2.1 offers a new engine and new rule sets defending against Java injections, an initial set of file upload checks, and fewer false positives compared with CRS versions. You can alsocustomize rules to suit your needs. Learn more about the newAzure WAF engine.
DRS 2.1 includes 17 rule groups, as shown in the following table. Each group contains multiple rules, and you can customize behavior for individual rules, rule groups, or entire rule set.
Fine-tuning guidance for DRS 2.1
Use the following guidance to tune WAF while you get started with DRS 2.1 on Application Gateway WAF:
Core rule set 3.2
The recommended managed rule set is the Default Rule Set 2.1, which is baselined off the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.3.2 and includes additional proprietary protections rules developed by Microsoft Threat Intelligence team and updates to signatures to reduce false positives. As an alternative to DRS 2.1, you can use CRS 3.2 which is based off OWASP CRS 3.2.0 version.
CRS 3.2 includes 14 rule groups, as shown in the following table. Each group contains multiple rules, which can be disabled.
Note
CRS 3.2 is only available on the WAF_v2 SKU. Because CRS 3.2 runs on the new Azure WAF engine, you can't downgrade to CRS 3.1 or earlier. If you need to downgrade,contact Azure Support.
Tuning of Managed rule sets
Both DRS and CRS are enabled by default in Detection mode in your WAF policies. You can disable or enable individual rules within the Managed Rule Set to meet your application requirements. You can also set specific actions per rule. The DRS/CRS supports block, log and anomaly score actions. The Bot Manager ruleset supports the allow, block, and log actions.
Sometimes you might need to omit certain request attributes from a WAF evaluation. A common example is Active Directory-inserted tokens that are used for authentication. You can configure exclusions to apply when specific WAF rules are evaluated, or to apply globally to the evaluation of all WAF rules. Exclusion rules apply to your whole web application. For more information, seeWeb Application Firewall (WAF) with Application Gateway exclusion lists.
By default, DRS version 2.1 / CRS version 3.2 and above uses anomaly scoring when a request matches a rule. CRS 3.1 and below blocks matching requests by default. Additionally, custom rules can be configured in the same WAF policy if you want to bypass any of the preconfigured rules in the Core Rule Set.
Custom rules are always applied before rules in the Core Rule Set are evaluated. If a request matches a custom rule, the corresponding rule action is applied. The request is either blocked or passed through to the back-end. No other custom rules or the rules in the Core Rule Set are processed.
Anomaly scoring
When you use CRS or DRS 2.1 and later, your WAF is configured to use anomaly scoring by default. Traffic that matches any rule isn't immediately blocked, even when your WAF is in prevention mode. Instead, the OWASP rule sets define a severity for each rule: Critical, Error, Warning, or Notice. The severity affects a numeric value for the request, which is called the anomaly score:
If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, and the WAF is in Prevention mode, the request is blocked. If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, and the WAF is in Detection mode, the request is logged but not blocked.
For example, a singleCriticalrule match is enough for the WAF to block a request when in Prevention mode, because the overall anomaly score is 5. However, oneWarningrule match only increases the anomaly score by 3, which isn't enough by itself to block the traffic. When an anomaly rule is triggered, it shows a "Matched" action in the logs. If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, there's a separate rule triggered with either "Blocked" or "Detected" action depending on whether WAF policy is in Prevention or Detection mode. For more information, please seeAnomaly Scoring mode.
Paranoia level
Each rule is asigned in a specific Paranoia Level (PL). Rules configured in Paranoia Level 1 (PL1) are less aggressive and hardly ever trigger a false positive. They provide baseline security with minimal need for fine tuning. Rules in PL2 detect more attacks, but they are expected to trigger false positives which should be fine-tuned.
By default, DRS 2.1 and CRS 3.2 rule versions are pre-configured in Paranoia Level 2, including rules assigned in both PL1 and in PL2.
If you want to use WAF exclusively with PL1, you can disable any or all PL2 rules or change their action to 'log'. PL3 and PL4 are currently not supported in Azure WAF.
Note
CRS 3.2 ruleset includes rules in PL3 and PL4, but these rules are always inactive and can't be enabled, regardless of their configured state or action.
Upgrading or changing ruleset version
If you're upgrading, or assigning a new ruleset version, and would like to preserve existing rule overrides and exclusions, it's recommended to use PowerShell, CLI, REST API, or a template to make ruleset version changes. A new version of a ruleset can have newer rules, additional rule groups, and may have updates to existing signatures to enforce better security and reduce false positives. It's recommended to validate changes in a test environment, fine tune if necessary, and then deploy in a production environment.
Note
If you're using the Azure portal to assign a new managed ruleset to a WAF policy, all the previous customizations from the existing managed ruleset such as rule state, rule actions, and rule level exclusions will be reset to the new managed ruleset's defaults. However, any custom rules, policy settings, and global exclusions will remain unaffected during the new ruleset assignment. You'll need to redefine rule overrides and validate changes before deploying in a production environment.
OWASP CRS 3.1
CRS 3.1 includes 14 rule groups, as shown in the following table. Each group contains multiple rules, which can be disabled. The ruleset is based off OWASP CRS 3.1.1 version.
Note
CRS 3.1 is only available on the WAF_v2 SKU.
Bot Manager 1.0
The Bot Manager 1.0 rule set provides protection against malicious bots and detection of good bots. The rules provide granular control over bots detected by WAF by categorizing bot traffic as Good, Bad, or Unknown bots.
Bot Manager 1.1
The Bot Manager 1.1 rule set is an enhancement to Bot Manager 1.0 rule set. It provides enhanced protection against malicious bots, and increases good bot detection.
The following rule groups and rules are available when using Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway.
