You need an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account to create a workspace. The simplest choice is to create a new one. If you want to reuse an existing one, you need to perform extra configuration:Option 1: Create a new Data Lake Storage Gen2 account:UnderSelect Data Lake Storage Gen 2>Account Name, selectCreate New. Provide a global unique name, such ascontosolake.UnderSelect Data Lake Storage Gen 2>File system name, selectFile Systemand name itusers.Option 2: See the instructions inPrepare an existing storage account for use with Azure Synapse Analytics.

Your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace uses this storage account as the primary storage account and the container to store workspace data. The workspace stores data in Apache Spark tables. It stores Spark application logs under a folder named/synapse/workspacename.
