Azure Monitor collects and aggregates metrics and logs from your system to monitor availability, performance, and resilience, and notify you of issues affecting your system. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, or client libraries to set up and view monitoring data.
Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. This article describes the types of monitoring data you can collect for this service and ways to analyze that data.
Collect data with Azure Monitor
This table describes how you can collect data to monitor your service, and what you can do with the data once collected:
For the list of all of the data supported by Azure Monitor, see:
Azure Monitor supported metrics
Azure Monitor supported resource logs
Use Azure Monitor tools to analyze the data
These Azure Monitor tools are available in the Azure portal to help you analyze monitoring data:
Some Azure services have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal. These dashboards are calledinsights, and you can find them in theInsightssection of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

Log Analyticsallows you to query and analyze log data using theKusto query language (KQL). For more information, seeGet started with log queries in Azure Monitor.

The Azure portal has a user interface for viewing and basic searches of theactivity log. To do more in-depth analysis, route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:
Dashboardsthat let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.
Workbooks, customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.
Grafana, an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.
Power BI, a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.
Export Azure Monitor data
You can export data out of Azure Monitor into other tools using:
Metrics:Use theREST API for metricsto extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. For more information, seeAzure Monitor REST API reference.

Use Kusto queries to analyze log data
You can analyze Azure Monitor Log data using the Kusto query language (KQL). For more information, seeLog queries in Azure Monitor.
For Kusto queries in Azure Resource Graph Explorer, seePrivate DNS information in Azure Resource Graph.
Use Azure Monitor alerts to notify you of issues
Azure Monitor alertsallow you to identify and address issues in your system, and proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data before your customers notice them. You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There aredifferent types of Azure Monitor alertsdepending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. SeeChoosing the right type of alert rule.
To configure alerting for Azure DNS zones:
SelectAlertsfromMonitorpage in the Azure portal. Then select+ New alert rule.

For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, seeSample log alert queries.
Implementing alerts at scale
For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region.Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines at scale.
