You can download your invoice in theAzure portalor get it sent in email. Invoices are sent to the person set to receive invoices for the enrollment.
If you're an Azure customer with an Enterprise Agreement (EA customer), only an EA administrator can download and view your organization's invoice. Direct EA administrators canDownload or view their Azure billing invoice. Indirect EA administrators can use the information atAzure Enterprise enrollment invoicesto download their invoice.
Where invoices are generated
An invoice is generated based on your billing account type. Invoices are created for Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) also called pay-as-you-go, Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), and Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) billing accounts. Invoices are also generated for Enterprise Agreement (EA) billing accounts.
To learn more about billing accounts and identify your billing account type, seeView billing accounts in Azure portal.
Invoice status
When you review your invoice status in the Azure portal, each invoice has one of the following status symbols.
When an invoice is created, it appears in the Azure portal withDuestatus. Due status is normal and expected.
When an invoice wasn't paid, its status is shown asPast due. A past due subscription gets disabled if the invoice isn't paid.
Invoices for MOSP billing accounts
An MOSP billing account is created when you sign up for Azure through the Azure website. For example, when you sign up for anAzure Free Account,account with pay-as-you-go ratesor as aVisual Studio subscriber.
Customers in select regions, who sign up through the Azure website for anaccount with pay-as-you-go ratesor anAzure Free Accountcan have a billing account for an MCA.
If you're unsure of your billing account type, seeCheck your billing account typebefore following the instructions in this article.
An MOSP billing account can have the following invoices:
Azure service charges- An invoice is generated for each Azure subscription that contains Azure resources used by the subscription. The invoice contains charges for a billing period. The billing period gets determined by the day of the month when the subscription is created.
For example, a billing administrator createsAzure sub 01on 5 March andAzure sub 02on 10 March. The invoice forAzure sub 01will have charges from the fifth day of a month to the fourth day of next month. The invoice forAzure sub 02will have charges from the tenth day of a month to the ninth day of next month. The invoices for all Azure subscriptions are normally generated on the day of the month that the account was created but can be up to two days later. In this example, if the billing administrator created their account on 2 February, the invoices for bothAzure sub 01andAzure sub 02will normally be generated on the second day of each month. However, it could be up to two days later.
Azure Marketplace, reservations, and spot VMs- An invoice is generated for reservations, marketplace products, and spot VMs purchased using a subscription. The invoice shows respective charges from the previous month. For example, John purchased a reservation on 1 March and another reservation on 30 March. A single invoice is generated for both the reservations in April. The invoice for Azure Marketplace, reservations, and spot VMs are always generated around the ninth day of the month.
If you pay for Azure with a credit card and you buy reservation, Azure generates an immediate invoice. However, when billed by an invoice, you're charged for the reservation on your next monthly invoice.
Azure support plan- An invoice is generated each month for your support plan subscription. The first invoice is generated on the day of purchase or up to two days later. Later support plan invoices are normally generated on the same day of the month that the account was created but could be generated up to two days later.
