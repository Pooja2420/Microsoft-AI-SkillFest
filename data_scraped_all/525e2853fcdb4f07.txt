This article details the availability and quota limits of Azure Container Instances compute, memory, and storage resources in Azure regions and by target operating system. For a general list of available regions for Azure Container Instances, seeavailable regions.
Values presented are the maximum resources available per deployment of acontainer group. Values are current at time of publication.
Note
Container groups created within these resource limits are subject to availability within the deployment region. When a region is under heavy load, you may experience a failure when deploying instances. To mitigate such a deployment failure, try deploying instances with lower resource settings, or try your deployment at a later time or in a different region with available resources.
Default Quota Limits
All Azure services include certain default limits and quotas for resources and features. This section details the default quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances.
Use theList UsageAPI to review current quota usage in a region for a subscription.
Certain default limits and quotas can be increased. To request an increase of one or more resources that support such an increase, submit anAzure support request(select "Quota" forIssue type).
Important
Not all limit increase requests are guaranteed to be approved.
Deployments with GPU resources aren't supported in an Azure virtual network deployment and are only available on Linux container groups.
Using GPU resources (preview) isn't fully supported yet and any support is provided on a best-effort basis.
Unchangeable (Hard) Limits
The following limits are default limits that canât be increased through a quota request. Any quota increase requests for these limits won't be approved.
Changeable Limits (Eligible for Quota Increases)
Note
1: Indicates that the feature maximum is configurable and may be increased through a support request. For more information on how to request a quota increase, see theHow to request a quota increase section of Increase VM-family vCPU quotes.
You can also create a support ticket if you'd like to discuss your specific needs with the support team.
Standard Container Resources
By default, the following resources are available general purpose (standard core SKU) containers in general deployments andAzure virtual networkdeployments) for Linux & Windows containers. These maximums are hard limits and can't be increased.
For a general list of available regions for Azure Container Instances, seeavailable regions.
Note
Big Container SKUs are in preview, and you may experience errors in some regions that you deploy. Preview features aren't ideal for critical workloads. If you're experiencing errors when deploying containers with greater than 4 vCPU and 16 GB in a certain region, please submit anAzure support request(select "Quota" forSupport type).
The following resources are available in all Azure Regions supported by Azure Container Instances. For a general list of available regions for Azure Container Instances, seeavailable regions.
Confidential Container Resources
The following maximum resources are available to a container group deployed usingConfidential Containers. These maximums are hard limits and can't be increased.

Spot Container Resources (Preview)
The following maximum resources are available to a container group deployed usingSpot Containers(preview). These maximums are hard limits and can't be increased.
Note
Spot Containers are only available in the following regions at this time: East US 2, West Europe, and West US.
GPU Container Resources (Preview)
Important
K80 and P100 GPU SKUs were retired on August 31st, 2023. This is due to the retirement of the underlying VMs used:NC SeriesandNCv2 SeriesAlthough V100 SKUs will be available, it's recommended to use Azure Kubernetes Service instead. GPU resources aren't fully supported and shouldn't be used for production workloads. Use the following resources to migrate to AKS today:How to Migrate to AKS.
Note
Not all limit increase requests are guaranteed to be approved.
Deployments with GPU resources aren't supported in an Azure virtual network deployment and are only available on Linux container groups.
Using GPU resources (preview) isn't fully supported yet and any support is provided on a best-effort basis.
The following maximum resources are available to a container group deployed withGPU resources(preview). These maximums are hard limits and can't be increased.
Next steps
Certain default limits and quotas can be increased. To request an increase of one or more resources that support such an increase, submit anAzure support request(select "Quota" forIssue type).
