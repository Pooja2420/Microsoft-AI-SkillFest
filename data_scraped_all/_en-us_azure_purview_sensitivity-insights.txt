Launch your Microsoft Purview account from Azure.
View sensitivity labeling insights on your data
Drill down for more sensitivity labeling details on your data
Prerequisites
Before getting started with Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:
Set up your Azure resources and populated the relevant accounts with test data
Extended sensitivity labels to assets in the Microsoft Purview Data Map, and created or selected the labels you want to apply to your data.
Set up and completed a scan on the test data in each data source. For more information, seeManage data sources in Microsoft PurviewandCreate a scan rule set.
Permissions depending on your current experience:If using the classic Microsoft Purview Catalog, you need thedata curator role or insight reader role.If using the new Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog, you needdata health readerpermissions.

Use Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights for sensitivity labels
Classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify data of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning.
Sensitivity labels enable you to state how sensitive certain data is in your organization. For example, a specific project name might be highly confidential within your organization, while that same term is not confidential to other organizations.
Classifications are matched directly, such as a social security number, which has a classification ofSocial Security Number.
In contrast, sensitivity labels are applied when one or more classifications and conditions are found together. In this context,conditionsrefer to all the parameters that you can define for unstructured data, such asproximity to another classification, and% confidence.
Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights uses the same classifications, also known assensitive information types, as those used with Microsoft 365 apps and services. This enables you to extend your existing sensitivity labels to assets in the data map.
Note
After you have scanned your source types, giveSensitivity labelingInsights a couple of hours to reflect the new assets.
