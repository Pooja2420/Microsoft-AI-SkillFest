Using Azure Spot Virtual Machines allows you to take advantage of our unused capacity at a significant cost savings. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict Azure Spot Virtual Machines. Therefore, Azure Spot Virtual Machines are great for workloads that can handle interruptions like batch processing jobs, dev/test environments, large compute workloads, and more.
The amount of available capacity can vary based on size, region, time of day, and more. When deploying Azure Spot Virtual Machines, Azure will allocate the VMs if there's capacity available, but there's no SLA for these VMs. An Azure Spot Virtual Machine offers no high availability guarantees. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict Azure Spot Virtual Machines with 30-seconds notice.

Eviction policy
Spot VMs can be stopped if Azure needs capacity for other pay-as-you-go workloads or when the price of the spot instance exceeds the maximum price that you have set. When creating an Azure Spot Virtual Machine, you can set the eviction policy toDeallocate(default) orDelete.
TheDeallocatepolicy moves your VM to the stopped-deallocated state, allowing you to redeploy it later. However, there's no guarantee that the allocation will succeed. The deallocated VMs will count against your quota and you'll be charged storage costs for the underlying disks.
If you would like your VM to be deleted when it's evicted, you can set the eviction policy todelete. The evicted VMs are deleted together with their underlying disks, so you'll not continue to be charged for the storage.
You can opt in to receive in-VM notifications throughAzure Scheduled Events. These are delivered on a best effort basis up to 30 seconds prior to the eviction.

Limitations
The following VM sizes aren't supported for Azure Spot Virtual Machines:
B-series
Promo versions of any size (like Dv2, NV, NC, H promo sizes)
Azure Spot Virtual Machines can be deployed to any region, except Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.

The followingoffer typesare currently supported:
Enterprise Agreement
Pay-as-you-go offer code (003P)
Sponsored (0036P and 0136P) - not available in Fairfax
For Cloud Service Provider (CSP), see thePartner Centeror contact your partner directly.
Pricing
Pricing for Azure Spot Virtual Machines is variable, based on region and SKU. For more information, see VM pricing forLinuxandWindows.
You can also query pricing information using theAzure retail prices APIto query for information about Spot pricing. ThemeterNameandskuNamewill both containSpot.
meterName
skuName
Spot
With variable pricing, you have option to set a max price, in US dollars (USD), using up to five decimal places. For example, the value0.98765would be a max price of $0.98765 USD per hour. If you set the max price to be-1, the VM won't be evicted based on price. The price for the VM will be the current price for spot or the price for a standard VM, which ever is less, as long as there's capacity and quota available.
0.98765

Pricing and eviction history
Portal
You can see historical pricing and eviction rates per size in a region in the portal while you are creating the VM. After selecting the checkbox toRun with Azure Spot discount, a link will appear under the size selection of the VM titledView pricing history and compare prices in nearby regions. By selecting that link you will be able to see a table or graph of spot pricing for the specified VM size.   The pricing and eviction rates in the following images are only examples.
Tip
Eviction rates are quotedper hour. For example, an eviction rate of 10% means a VM has a 10% chance of being evicted within the next hour, based on historical eviction data of the last 7 days.

Azure Resource Graph
You can programmatically access relevant Spot VM SKU data throughAzure Resource Graph. Get pricing history in the last 90 days and eviction rates for the last 28 trailing days to identify SKUs that better meet your specific needs.
Key benefits:
Query Spot eviction rates and the last few months of Spot prices programmatically through ARM or theARG Explorer in Azure portalâ¯
Create a custom query to extract the specific data relevant to your scenario with the ability to filter across a variety of parameters, such as SKU and regionâ¯
Easily compare data across multiple regions and SKUsâ¯
Find a different Spot SKU or region with a lower price and/or eviction rateâ¯
Try out the following sample queries for Spot pricing history and eviction rates using theARG Explorer in Azure portal. Spot pricing history and eviction rates data are available in theSpotResourcestable.â¯

Frequently asked questions
Q:Once created, is an Azure Spot Virtual Machine the same as regular standard VM?
A:Yes, except there's no SLA for Azure Spot Virtual Machines and they can be evicted at any time.
Q:What to do when you get evicted, but still need capacity?
A:We recommend you use standard VMs instead of Azure Spot Virtual Machines if you need capacity right away.
Q:How is quota managed for Azure Spot Virtual Machines?
A:Azure Spot Virtual Machines will have a separate quota pool. Spot quota will be shared between VMs and scale-set instances. For more information, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints.
Q:Can I request for additional quota for Azure Spot Virtual Machines?
A:Yes, you'll be able to submit the request to increase your quota for Azure Spot Virtual Machines through thestandard quota request process.
Q:Where can I post questions?
A:You can post and tag your question withazure-spotatQ&A.
azure-spot
Q:How can I change the max price for a spot VM?
A:Before you can change the max price, you need to deallocate the VM. Then you can change the max price in the portal, from theConfigurationsection for the VM.
Q:Can I convert existing VMs to Spot VMs?
A:No, setting the Spot flag is only supported at creation time.
Q:Can I convert Spot VMs to Standard VMs?
A:No, Spot VMs cannot be directly converted to Standard VMs.
