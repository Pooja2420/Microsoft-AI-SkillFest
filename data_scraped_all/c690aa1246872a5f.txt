Important
The preview solution for protecting Azure Database for MySQL flexible servers using Azure Backup is currently paused. Please refrain from configuring new backups until further notice. Rest assured, all existing backup data remains safe and available for restore. In the meantime, you can refer to theblog post instructionsto create long-term backups manually, ensuring compliance with your immediate needs.
This article describes how to back up your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server by using Azure Backup.
Here are important considerations for this preview feature:
Currently, this feature supports only theweekly backupoption. However, you can schedule the backups on multiple days of the week.

Retention duration ranges from 7 days to 10 years in the backup data store.

Each retention rule requires inputs for specific backups, data store, and retention duration for the backups.
Each retention rule requires inputs for specific backups, data store, and retention duration for the backups.
The retention rules are evaluated in a predetermined order of priority. The priority is the highest for the yearly rule, followed by the monthly rule, and then the weekly rule.Default retention settings are applied when no other rules qualify. For example, the same recovery point might be the first successful backup taken every week in addition to the first successful backup taken every month. However, because the priority of the monthly rule is higher than the priority of the weekly rule, the retention that corresponds to the first successful backup taken every month applies.
