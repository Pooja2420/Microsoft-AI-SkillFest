VMs aren't joined to the domain
Follow these instructions if you're having issues joining virtual machines (VMs) to the domain.
Join the VM manually using the process inJoin a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domainor using thedomain join template.
Try pinging the domain name from a command line on the VM.
Review the list of domain join error messages inTroubleshooting Domain Join Error Messages.
Error: Incorrect credentials
There was a typo made when the credentials were entered in the Azure Resource Manager template interface fixes.
Take one of the following actions to resolve the issue:
Manually add the VMs to a domain.
Redeploy the template once credentials have been confirmed. SeeCreate a host pool with PowerShell.
Join VMs to a domain using a template withJoins an existing Windows VM to AD Domain.
Error: Timeout waiting for user input
The account used to complete the domain join might have multifactor authentication (MFA).
Take one of the following actions to resolve the issue:
Temporarily remove MFA for the account.
Use a service account.
Error: The account used during provisioning doesn't have permissions to complete the operation
The account being used doesn't have permissions to join VMs to the domain due to compliance and regulations.
Take one of the following actions to resolve.
Use an account that is a member of the Administrator group.
Grant the necessary permissions to the account being used.
Error: Domain name doesn't resolve
VMs are on a virtual network that's not associated with the virtual network where the domain is located.
Create virtual network peering between the virtual network where VMs were provisioned and the virtual network where the domain controller (DC) is running. SeeCreate a virtual network peering - Resource Manager, different subscriptions.
When using Microsoft Entra Domain Services, the virtual network doesn't have its Domain Name System (DNS) server settings updated to point to the managed domain controllers.
To update the DNS settings for the virtual network containing Microsoft Entra Domain Services, seeUpdate DNS settings for the Azure virtual network.
The network interface's DNS server settings don't point to the appropriate DNS server on the virtual network.
Take one of the following actions to resolve the issue by following the steps inChange DNS servers:
Change the network interface's DNS server settings toCustomwith the steps fromChange DNS serversand specify the private IP addresses of the DNS servers on the virtual network.
Change the network interface's DNS server settings toInherit from virtual networkwith the steps fromChange DNS servers, and then change the virtual network's DNS server settings with the steps fromChange DNS servers.
Error: Computer account reuse is blocked in an Active Directory domain
You attempt to reuse a computer account (hostname), have applied Windows updates released on and after October 11, 2022, and the user account provided for the domain doesn't have sufficient permissions to reuse computer accounts.
Take one of the following actions to resolve the issue:
Use the same user account that was used to create the existing computer account object.
Use a user account that is a member of theDomain Administratorssecurity group.
Use a user account that has the Group Policy settingDomain controller: Allow computer account re-use during domain joinapplied. This setting requires the installation of Windows updates released on or after March 14, 2023, on all member computers and domain controllers in the Active Directory domain.
For more information on the permissions changes for computer account reuse, seeKB5020276 - Netjoin: Domain join hardening changes.
Azure Virtual Desktop Agent and Azure Virtual Desktop Boot Loader aren't installed
The recommended way to provision VMs is using the Azure portal creation template. The template automatically installs the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent and Azure Virtual Desktop Agent Boot Loader.
Follow these instructions to confirm the components are installed and to check for error messages.
Confirm that the two components are installed by checking inControl Panel>Programs>Programs and Features. IfAzure Virtual Desktop AgentandAzure Virtual Desktop Agent Boot Loaderaren't visible, they aren't installed on the VM.
OpenFile Explorerand navigate toC:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log. If the file is missing, it indicates that the PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) that installed the two components wasn't able to run in the security context provided.
If the fileC:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.logexists, open it and check for error messages.
Error: Azure Virtual Desktop Agent and Azure Virtual Desktop Agent Boot Loader are missing. C:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log is also missing
Credentials provided during input for the Azure Resource Manager template were incorrect or permissions were insufficient.
Manually add the missing components to the VMs usingCreate a host pool with PowerShell.
PowerShell DSC was able to start and execute but failed to complete as it can't sign in to Azure Virtual Desktop and obtain needed information.
Confirm the items in the following list.
Make sure the account doesn't have MFA.
Confirm the host pool's name is accurate and the host pool exists in Azure Virtual Desktop.
Confirm the account has at least Contributor permissions on the Azure subscription or resource group.
Error: Authentication failed, error in C:\Windows\Temp\ScriptLog.log
PowerShell DSC was able to execute but couldn't connect to Azure Virtual Desktop.
Confirm the items in the following list.
Manually register the VMs with the Azure Virtual Desktop service.
Confirm the account used for connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop has permissions on the Azure subscription or resource group to create host pools.
Confirm the account doesn't have MFA.
Azure Virtual Desktop Agent isn't registering with the Azure Virtual Desktop service
When the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent is first installed on session host VMs (either manually or through the Azure Resource Manager template and PowerShell DSC), it provides a registration token. The following section covers troubleshooting issues that apply to the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent and the token.
Error: The status filed in Get-AzWvdSessionHost cmdlet shows status as Unavailable
The agent isn't able to update itself to a new version.
Follow these instructions to manually update the agent:
Download a new version of the agent on the session host VM.
Launch Task Manager. In theServicetab, stop theRDAgentBootLoaderservice.
Run the installer for the new version of the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent.
When prompted for the registration token, remove the entryINVALID_TOKENand press next (a new token isn't required).

Remote Desktop licensing mode isn't configured
If you sign in to Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session using an administrative account, you might receive a notification that says, "Remote Desktop licensing mode isn't configured, Remote Desktop Services will stop working inXdays. On the Connection Broker server, use Server Manager to specify the Remote Desktop licensing mode."
If the time limit expires, the following error message will appear:
The remote session was disconnected because there are no Remote Desktop client access licenses available for this computer.
If you see either of these messages, it means the image doesn't have the latest Windows updates installed or you're setting the Remote Desktop licensing mode through group policy. Follow the steps in the next sections to check the group policy setting, identify the version of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, and install the corresponding update.
Note
Azure Virtual Desktop only requires a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) client access license (CAL) when your host pool contains Windows Server session hosts. For more information on configuring an RDS CAL, seeLicense your RDS deployment with client access licenses.
Disable the Remote Desktop licensing mode group policy setting
Check the group policy setting by opening the Group Policy Editor in the VM and navigating toAdministrative Templates>Windows Components>Remote Desktop Services>Remote Desktop Session Host>Licensing>Set the Remote Desktop licensing mode. If the group policy setting isEnabled, change it toDisabled. If it's already disabled, then leave it as-is.
Note
If you set group policy through your domain, disable this setting on policies that target these Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session VMs.
Identify which version of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session you're using
