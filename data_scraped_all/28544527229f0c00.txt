Azure Artifacts enables you to publish, consume, and store various types of packages in your feed. By configuring permissions for your feed, you can manage access to your packages and control who can interact with them.

Note
By default, theProject Collection Build Service(org-scoped) and the project-levelBuild Service(project-scoped) are assigned theFeed and Upstream Reader (Collaborator)role.
Note
By default, theProject Collection Build Serviceis automatically assigned theFeed and Upstream Reader (Collaborator)role for newly created collection-scoped feeds.
Permissions table
Note
Azure Artifacts Administrators, includingProject Collection Administrators, automatically have theFeed Ownerrole on all feeds.
Note
In Azure Artifacts, feeds may be scoped to a single project or to the entire organization.
To access a project-scoped feed, a user must also have access to the project containing that feed.
Feed views settings
Feed views enable users to share certain packages while keeping others private. A common scenario for using a feed view is sharing a package version that has already been tested and validated but keeping packages under development private.
By default, there are three views in a feed:@Local,@Prerelease, and@Release. The latter two are suggested views that you can rename or delete as desired. The@Localview is the default view and it includes all the packages published to the feed as well as all the packages downloaded from upstream sources.
Important
Users who have access to a specific view are able to access and download packages from the feed through that view even if they don't have direct access to that feed.
If you want to completely hide your packages, you must restrict access to both the feed and its views.

Note
To add a feed from a different organization as an upstream source, the target feed owner needs to share the target view withAll feeds and people in organizations associated with my Microsoft Entra tenantby navigating toFeed Settings>Views, selecting the ellipsis next to the specified view, selectingEdit, and adjusting the permissions.
Important
Views inherit permissions from the parent feed. If you set a view's visibility toSpecific peoplewithout specifying any users or groups, the view's permissions will default back to the permissions of its parent feed.
Pipelines permissions
To access your feed from your pipeline, thecorresponding build identitymust have the necessary permissions.
If your pipeline is unable to access your feed, you might need to add the corresponding build identity to your feed's permissions.
Tip
The project-level build identity is named[Project name] Build Service ([Organization name]), for exampleFabrikamFiber Build Service (codesharing-demo).
[Project name] Build Service ([Organization name])
FabrikamFiber Build Service (codesharing-demo)
The organization-level build identity is namedProject Collection Build Service ([Organization name]), for exampleProject Collection Build Service (codesharing-demo).
Project Collection Build Service ([Organization name])

SelectPermissions, then selectAdd users/groups. Add your build identity and assign it theFeed and Upstream Reader (Collaborator)role. If your pipeline needs to publish packages to the feed, make sure that both theProject Collection Build Serviceand yourproject's Build Serviceidentities have theFeed Publisher (Contributor)role. See the examples below to learn how to authenticate and publish packages to your feed with Azure Pipelines.

Note
If you want to access a feed in a different project from your pipeline, and your pipeline uses the project-level build identity, you must set up the other project to grant that identity at least the "Read project-level information" permission.
