Azure CycleCloud supports monitoring of external services through its pluggable
architecture. Administrators can enable automatic monitoring
of these systems by going to theSettingspage under the user menu in the top
right corner of the web interface, double-clicking theCycleCloudsettings item, and checking the box labeledEnable monitoring for CycleCloud
services.
When you enable this option, supported services in each cluster automatically
register with CycleCloud, which configures monitoring for that
service.
Supported services
Ganglia
Every version of CycleCloud ships with Ganglia monitoring support for collecting
performance metrics such as CPU/memory/bandwidth usage. If your cluster is
configured to use Ganglia (the default in most cases), automatic monitoring
works as long as port 8652 is open between CycleCloud and the cluster's
primary node (the one running thegmetadservice).
gmetad
Ganglia on CentOS/RHEL
EPELprovides Ganglia on CentOS and RHEL.
Azure CycleCloud configures and installs EPEL and the Ganglia dependencies by default.
To opt out of using EPEL, setcyclecloud.install_epel = falsein a cluster
template. Opting out of EPEL skips Ganglia monitoring setup. This change doesn't affect the computational
functionality of your compute cluster, but it foregoes data that the reports
view of your cluster collects.
cyclecloud.install_epel = false
For informational purposes, here are the "client" dependencies installed on execute cluster nodes,
and the "server" dependencies installed on primary cluster nodes.

Grid Engine
If you run the Grid Scheduling Edition of CycleCloud, Grid Engine
monitoring is automatically configured when you start a Grid Engine cluster. The only requirement is that CycleCloud can SSH to the node running theqmasterservice with the keypair configured for the cluster.
qmaster
Azure Monitor
Starting with CycleCloud 8.0, metrics for a cluster are pulled fromAzure Monitorinstead of Ganglia.
This change removes the need to open port 8652 inbound on nodes.
Note
Even clusters that use version 7 with Ganglia preinstalled get their metrics from Azure Monitor in CycleCloud 8.
The collected metrics are:
Percentage CPU
Disk Read Bytes
Disk Write Bytes
Network In
Network Out
You can also store log data from CycleCloud clusters to Log Analytics and create custom metrics dashboards. For more information on creating custom metrics dashboards from Log Analytics for your clusters, see the How-to section and the tutorials in theAzure Monitor documentation.
