Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
As some new features get introduced, you can turn them on or off. You can try them out, provide feedback, and work with the ones that meet your requirements. Some preview features provide access to new functionality, while others reflect a change to the user interface, but little or no change in functionality.
Note
It might take up to three weeks after a release to Azure DevOps for the preview feature to appear in your organization. Thelatest release notesusually provide information on new preview features. You can turn on or off select features for Azure DevOps. Preview features become available first on Azure DevOps Services and then become standard features with an update to Azure DevOps Server. At some point, the preview feature moves out of preview status and becomes a regular feature of the web portal.
