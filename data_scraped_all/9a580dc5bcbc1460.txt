Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetesprovides a centralized, consistent control plane to manage policy, governance, and security across Kubernetes clusters in different environments.
Azure Arc agents are deployed on Kubernetes clusters when youconnect them to Azure Arc. This article provides an overview of these agents.
Deploy agents to your cluster
Most on-premises datacenters enforce strict network rules that prevent inbound communication on the network boundary firewall. Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes works with these restrictions by not requiring inbound ports on the firewall. Azure Arc agents require outbound communication to aset list of network endpoints.
This diagram provides a high-level view of Azure Arc components. Kubernetes clusters in on-premises datacenters or different clouds are connected to Azure through the Azure Arc agents. This connection allows the clusters to be managed in Azure using management tools and Azure services. The clusters can also be accessed through offline management tools.

The following high-level steps are involved inconnecting a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc:
Create a Kubernetes cluster on your choice of infrastructure (VMware vSphere, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes distribution). The cluster must already exist before you connect it to Azure Arc.

Start the Azure Arc registration for your cluster. This process deploys the agent Helm chart on the cluster. After that, the cluster nodes initiate an outbound communication to theMicrosoft Container Registry, pulling the images needed to create the following agents in theazure-arcnamespace:AgentDescriptiondeployment.apps/clusteridentityoperatorAzure Arc-enabled Kubernetes currently supports onlysystem assigned identities.clusteridentityoperatorinitiates the first outbound communication.

For more information on deploying the agents to a cluster, seeQuickstart: Connect an existing Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc.
Move Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters across Azure regions
In some circumstances, you may want to move yourArc-enabled Kubernetes clustersto another region. For example, you might want to deploy features or services that are only available in specific regions, or you need to change regions due to internal governance requirements or capacity planning considerations.
When you move a connected cluster to a new region, you delete theconnectedClustersAzure Resource Manager resource in the source region, then deploy the agents to recreate theconnectedClustersresource in the target region. For source control configurations,Flux configurations, andextensionswithin the cluster, you'll need to save details about the resources, then recreate the child resources in the new cluster resource.

Before you begin, ensure that Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resources (Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters) and any needed Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes configuration resources (Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/SourceControlConfigurations,Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/Extensions,Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/FluxConfigurations) aresupported in the target region.
Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/SourceControlConfigurations
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/Extensions
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/FluxConfigurations
Do a LIST to get all configuration resources in the source cluster (the cluster to be moved) and save the response body:Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/SourceControlConfigurationsMicrosoft.KubernetesConfiguration/ExtensionsMicrosoft.KubernetesConfiguration/FluxConfigurationsNoteLIST/GET of configuration resources don't returnConfigurationProtectedSettings. For such cases, the only option is to save the original request body and reuse them while creating the resources in the new region.

Using the response body you saved, recreate each of the configuration resources obtained in the LIST command from the source cluster on the target cluster. To confirm, compare the results from a LIST of all configuration resources in the target cluster with the original LIST response from the source cluster.
