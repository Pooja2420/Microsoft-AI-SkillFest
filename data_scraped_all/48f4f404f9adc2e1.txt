To perform guest OS operations on Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs, you must enable guest management on the VMs. When you enable guest management, the Arc Connected Machine Agent is installed on the VM.
Prerequisites
Before you enable guest management, ensure your target machine:
is running asupported operating system.

Enable guest management
Before you can install an extension, you must enable guest management on the SCVMM VM.
To enable guest management, follow these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search for and select the SCVMM VM for which you want to enable guest management and selectConfiguration.

For Linux, use the root account, and for Windows, use an account that is a member of the Local Administrators group.
Note
You can install Arc agents at scale on Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs through Azure portal only if you are running:
SCVMM 2022 UR1 or later versions of SCVMM server and console.
SCVMM 2019 UR5 or later versions of SCVMM server and console.
VMs running Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022, Windows 10, and Windows 11.For other SCVMM versions, Linux VMs, or Windows VMs running WS 2012 or earlier,install Arc agents through the script.
Delete a VM
To delete a VM that you no longer need, follow these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search for and select the VM you want to delete.

In the selected VM's Overview page, selectDelete.
In the selected VM's Overview page, selectDelete.
When prompted, confirm that you want to delete it.
When prompted, confirm that you want to delete it.
Note
This also deletes the VM on your SCVMM managed on-premises host.
Next step
Create a Virtual Machine on SCVMM managed on-premises hosts.
