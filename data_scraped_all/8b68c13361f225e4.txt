This guide is for information technology (IT) professionals, IT architects, information security analysts, and cloud administrators planning to use Defender for Cloud.
Planning guide
This guide provides the background for how Defender for Cloud fits into your organization's security requirements and cloud management model. It's important to understand how different individuals or teams in your organization use the service to meet secure development and operations, monitoring, governance, and incident response needs. The key areas to consider when planning to use Defender for Cloud are:
Security Roles and Access Controls
Security Policies and Recommendations
Data Collection and Storage
Onboarding non-Azure resources
Ongoing Security Monitoring
Incident Response
In the next section, you'll learn how to plan for each one of those areas and apply those recommendations based on your requirements.

Defender for Cloud usesAzure role-based access control (Azure Role-based access control), which providesbuilt-in rolesthat can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure. When a user opens Defender for Cloud, they only see information related to resources they have access to. Which means the user is assigned the role of Owner, Contributor, or Reader to the subscription or resource group that a resource belongs to. In addition to these roles, there are two roles specific to Defender for Cloud:
Security reader: a user that belongs to this role is able to view only Defender for Cloud configurations, which include recommendations, alerts, policy, and health, but it won't be able to make changes.
Security reader: a user that belongs to this role is able to view only Defender for Cloud configurations, which include recommendations, alerts, policy, and health, but it won't be able to make changes.
Security admin: same as security reader but it can also update the security policy, dismiss recommendations and alerts.

When planning access control using Azure Role-based access control for Defender for Cloud, make sure you understand who in your organization needs access to Defender for Cloud the tasks they'll perform. Then you can configure Azure Role-based access control properly.
Note
We recommend that you assign the least permissive role needed for users to complete their tasks. For example, users who only need to view information about the security state of resources but not take action, such as applying recommendations or editing policies, should be assigned the Reader role.
Security policies and recommendations
A security policy defines the desired configuration of your workloads and helps ensure compliance with company or regulatory security requirements. In Defender for Cloud, you can define policies for your Azure subscriptions, which can be tailored to the type of workload or the sensitivity of data.
Defenders for Cloud policies contain the following components:
Data collection: agent provisioning and data collection settings.
Data collection: agent provisioning and data collection settings.
Security policy: anAzure Policythat determines which controls are monitored and recommended by Defender for Cloud. You can also use Azure Policy to create new definitions, define more policies, and assign policies across management groups.

Note
Specifying a security contact ensures that Azure can reach the right person in your organization if a security incident occurs. ReadProvide security contact details in Defender for Cloudfor more information on how to enable this recommendation.
Security policies definitions and recommendations
Defender for Cloud automatically creates a default security policy for each of your Azure subscriptions. You can edit the policy in Defender for Cloud or use Azure Policy to create new definitions, define more policies, and assign policies across management groups. Management groups can represent the entire organization or a business unit within the organization. You can monitor policy compliance across these management groups.
Before configuring security policies, review each of thesecurity recommendations:
See if these policies are appropriate for your various subscriptions and resource groups.

Data collection and storage
Defender for Cloud uses the Log Analytics agent and the Azure Monitor Agent to collect security data from your virtual machines.Data collectedfrom this agent is stored in your Log Analytics workspaces.
Agent
When automatic provisioning is enabled in the security policy, thedata collection agentis installed on all supported Azure VMs and any new supported VMs that are created. If the VM or computer already has the Log Analytics agent installed, Defender for Cloud uses the current installed agent. The agent's process is designed to be non-invasive and have minimal effect on VM performance.
If at some point you want to disable Data Collection, you can turn it off in the security policy. However, because the Log Analytics agent might be used by other Azure management and monitoring services, the agent won't be uninstalled automatically when you turn off data collection in Defender for Cloud. You can manually uninstall the agent if needed.
Workspace
A workspace is an Azure resource that serves as a container for data. You or other members of your organization might use multiple workspaces to manage different sets of data that is collected from all or portions of your IT infrastructure.
Data collected from the Log Analytics agent can be stored in an existing Log Analytics workspace associated with your Azure subscription or a new workspace.
In the Azure portal, you can browse to see a list of your Log Analytics workspaces, including any created by Defender for Cloud. A related resource group is created for new workspaces. Resources are created according to this naming convention:
Workspace:DefaultWorkspace-[subscription-ID]-[geo]
Workspace:DefaultWorkspace-[subscription-ID]-[geo]
Resource Group:DefaultResourceGroup-[geo]
Resource Group:DefaultResourceGroup-[geo]
For workspaces created by Defender for Cloud, data is retained for 30 days. For existing workspaces, retention is based on the workspace pricing tier. If you want, you can also use an existing workspace.
If your agent reports to a workspace other than thedefaultworkspace, any Defender for CloudDefender plansthat you've enabled on the subscription should also be enabled on the workspace.
Note
Microsoft makes strong commitments to protect the privacy and security of this data. Microsoft adheres to strict compliance and security guidelinesâfrom coding to operating a service. For more information about data handling and privacy, readDefender for Cloud Data Security.
Onboard non-Azure resources
Defender for Cloud can monitor the security posture of your non-Azure computers but you need to first onboard these resources. ReadOnboard non-Azure computersfor more information on how to onboard non-Azure resources.
Ongoing security monitoring
After initial configuration and application of Defender for Cloud recommendations, the next step is considering Defender for Cloud operational processes.
The Defender for Cloud Overview provides a unified view of security across all your Azure resources and any non-Azure resources you've connected. This example shows an environment with many issues to resolve:

Note
Defender for Cloud doesn't interfere with your normal operational procedures. Defender for Cloud passively monitors your deployments and provides recommendations based on the security policies you enabled.
When you first opt in to use Defender for Cloud for your current Azure environment, make sure that you review all recommendations, which can be done in theRecommendationspage.
Plan to visit the threat intelligence option as part of your daily security operations. There you can identify security threats against the environment, such as identify if a particular computer is part of a botnet.
Monitor for new or changed resources
Most Azure environments are dynamic, with resources regularly being created, spun up or down, reconfigured, and changed. Defender for Cloud helps ensure that you have visibility into the security state of these new resources.
When you add new resources (VMs, SQL DBs) to your Azure environment, Defender for Cloud automatically discovers these resources and begins to monitor their security, including PaaS web roles and worker roles. If Data Collection is enabled in theSecurity Policy, more monitoring capabilities are enabled automatically for your virtual machines.
You should also regularly monitor existing resources for configuration changes that could have created security risks, drift from recommended baselines, and security alerts.
Harden access and applications
As part of your security operations, you should also adopt preventative measures to restrict access to VMs, and control the applications that are running on VMs. By locking down inbound traffic to your Azure VMs, you're reducing the exposure to attacks, and at the same time providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed. Usejust-in-time VM accessaccess feature to hardening access to your VMs.
Incident response
Defender for Cloud detects and alerts you to threats as they occur. Organizations should monitor for new security alerts and take action as needed to investigate further or remediate the attack. For more information on how Defender for Cloud threat protection works, readHow Defender for Cloud detects and responds to threats.
Although we can't create your Incident Response plan, we'll use Microsoft Azure Security Response in the Cloud lifecycle as the foundation for incident response stages. The stages of incident response in the cloud lifecycle are:

Note
You can use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)Computer Security Incident Handling Guideas a reference to assist you building your own.
You can use Defender for Cloud alerts during the following stages:
Detect: identify a suspicious activity in one or more resources.
Detect: identify a suspicious activity in one or more resources.
Assess: perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity.
Assess: perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity.
Diagnose: use the remediation steps to conduct the technical procedure to address the issue.
Diagnose: use the remediation steps to conduct the technical procedure to address the issue.
Each Security Alert provides information that can be used to better understand the nature of the attack and suggest possible mitigations. Some alerts also provide links to either more information or to other sources of information within Azure. You can use the information provided for further research and to begin mitigation, and you can also search security-related data that is stored in your workspace.
The following example shows a suspicious RDP activity taking place:

This page shows the details regarding the time that the attack took place, the source hostname, the target VM and also gives recommendation steps. In some circumstances, the source information of the attack might be empty. ReadMissing Source Information in Defender for Cloud alertsfor more information about this type of behavior.
Once you identify the compromised system, you can run aworkflow automationthat was previously created. Workflow automations are a collection of procedures that can be executed from Defender for Cloud once triggered by an alert.
