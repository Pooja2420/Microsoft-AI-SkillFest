It's designed as a standalone Azure service to provide SaaS experience to manage hybrid environments in Azure.
Logs created from patching operations such as update assessments and installations are stored by Azure Update Manager in Azure Resource Graph (ARG). You can view up to last seven days of assessment data, and up to last 30 days of update installation results.
