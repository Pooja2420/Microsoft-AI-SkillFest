SQL information protection'sdata discovery and classification mechanismprovides advanced capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases. It's built intoAzure SQL Database,Azure SQL Managed Instance, andAzure Synapse Analytics.
The classification mechanism is based on the following two elements:
Labelsâ The main classification attributes, used to define thesensitivity level of the datastored in the column.
Information Typesâ Provides additional granularity into thetype of datastored in the column.
The information protection policy options within Defender for Cloud provide a predefined set of labels and information types that serve as the defaults for the classification engine. You can customize the policy, according to your organization's needs, as described below.

How do I access the SQL information protection policy?
There are three ways to access the information protection policy:
(Recommended)From theEnvironment settingspage of Defender for Cloud
From the security recommendationSensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified
From the Azure SQL DB data discovery page
Each of these is shown in the relevant tab below.
From Defender for Cloud's settings
From Defender for Cloud's recommendation
From Azure SQL

Access the policy from Defender for Cloud's environment settings page
From Defender for Cloud'sEnvironment settingspage, selectSQL information protection.
Note
This option only appears for users with tenant-level permissions.Grant tenant-wide permissions to yourself.

Customize your information types
To manage and customize information types:
SelectManage information types.
SelectManage information types.

To add a new type, selectCreate information type. You can configure a name, description, and search pattern strings for the information type. Search pattern strings can optionally use keywords with wildcard characters (using the character '%'), which the automated discovery engine uses to identify sensitive data in your databases, based on the columns' metadata.

You can also modify the built-in types by adding additional search pattern strings, disabling some of the existing strings, or by changing the description.TipYou can't delete built-in types or change their names.

Tip
You can't delete built-in types or change their names.
Information typesare listed in order of ascending discovery ranking, meaning that the types higher in the list attempt to match first. To change the ranking between information types, drag the types to the right spot in the table, or use theMove upandMove downbuttons to change the order.
