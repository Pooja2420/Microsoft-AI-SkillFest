If the code doesn't include a readiness or liveness probe, the ingress controller makes an assumption that the service is reachable on either:
ThePathvalue that's specified forbackend-path-prefixannotation
Path

Thepathvalue that's specified in theingressdefinition for the service
path

Default values for the health probe
Any property that the readiness or liveness probe can't infer uses the following default values.
