Azure Data Catalog was retired on May 15, 2024.
For data catalog features, use theMicrosoft Purviewservice, which offers unified data governance for your entire data estate.
Introduction
Microsoft Azure Data Catalogis a fully managed cloud service that serves as a system of registration and system of discovery for enterprise data sources. In other words,Azure Data Catalogis all about helping people discover, understand, and use data sources, and helping organizations to get more value from their existing data. When a data source is registered withAzure Data Catalog, its metadata is copied and indexed by the service, but the story doesnât end there.
TheData Profilingfeature ofAzure Data Catalogexamines the data from supported data sources in your catalog and collects statistics and information about that data. It's easy to include a profile of your data assets. When you register a data asset, chooseInclude Data Profilein the data source registration tool.
What is data profiling?
Data profiling examines the data in the data source being registered, and collects statistics and information about that data. During data source discovery, these statistics can help you determine the suitability of the data to solve their business problem.
The following data sources support data profiling:
SQL Server (including Azure SQL DB and Azure Synapse Analytics) tables and views
Oracle tables and views
Teradata tables and views
Hive tables
Including data profiles when registering data assets helps users answer questions about data sources, including:
Can it be used to solve my business problem?
Does the data conform to particular standards or patterns?
What are some of the anomalies of the data source?
What are possible challenges of integrating this data into my application?
Note
You can also add documentation to an asset to describe how data could be integrated into an application. SeeHow to document data sources.

Note
SelectingInclude Data Profilein the data source registration tool includes both table and column-level profile information. However, the Data Catalog API allows data assets to be registered with only one set of profile information included.
Viewing data profile information
Once you find a suitable data source with a profile, you can view the data profile details. To view the data profile, select a data asset and chooseData Profilein the Data Catalog portal window.

Object data profile
Number of rows
Table size
When the object was last updated
Column data profile
Column data type
Number of distinct values
Number of rows with NULL values
Minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation for column values
Summary
Data profiling provides statistics and information about registered data assets to help you determine the suitability of the data to solve business problems. Along with annotating, and documenting data sources, data profiles can give users a deeper understanding of your data.
