APPLIES TO:NoSQL
In Azure Cosmos DB, every container has an indexing policy that dictates how the container's items should be indexed. The default indexing policy for newly created containers indexes every property of every item and enforces range indexes for any string or number. This allows you to get good query performance without having to think about indexing and index management upfront.
In some situations, you might want to override this automatic behavior to better suit your requirements. You can customize a container's indexing policy by setting itsindexing mode, and include or excludeproperty paths.
Note
The method of updating indexing policies described in this article only applies to Azure Cosmos DB API for NoSQL. Learn about indexing inAzure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB
Indexing mode
Azure Cosmos DB supports two indexing modes:
Consistent: The index is updated synchronously as you create, update, or delete items. This means that the consistency of your read queries will be theconsistency configured for the account.
None: Indexing is disabled on the container. This mode is commonly used when a container is used as a pure key-value store without the need for secondary indexes. It can also be used to improve the performance of bulk operations. After the bulk operations are complete, the index mode can be set to Consistent and then monitored using theIndexTransformationProgressuntil complete.
Note
Azure Cosmos DB also supports a Lazy indexing mode. Lazy indexing performs updates to the index at a much lower priority level when the engine is not doing any other work. This can result ininconsistent or incompletequery results. If you plan to query an Azure Cosmos DB container, you should not select lazy indexing. New containers cannot select lazy indexing. You can request an exemption by contacting cosmosdbindexing@microsoft.com (except if you are using an Azure Cosmos DB account inserverlessmode which doesn't support lazy indexing).
Index size
In Azure Cosmos DB, the total consumed storage is the combination of both the Data size and Index size. The following are some features of index size:
The index size depends on the indexing policy. If all the properties are indexed, then the index size can be larger than the data size.
When data is deleted, indexes are compacted on a near continuous basis. However, for small data deletions, you might not immediately observe a decrease in index size.
The Index size can temporarily grow when physical partitions split. The index space is released after the partition split is completed.
Note
The partition key (unless it is also "/id") is not indexed and should be included in the index.
The system properties id and _ts will always be indexed when the cosmos account indexing mode is Consistent
The system properties id and _ts are not included in the container policyâs indexed paths description. This is by design because these system properties are indexed by default and this behavior cannot be disabled.
Including and excluding property paths
A custom indexing policy can specify property paths that are explicitly included or excluded from indexing. By optimizing the number of paths that are indexed, you can substantially reduce the latency and RU charge of write operations. These paths are defined followingthe method described in the indexing overview sectionwith the following additions:
a path leading to a scalar value (string or number) ends with/?
/?
elements from an array are addressed together through the/[]notation (instead of/0,/1etc.)
/[]
/0
/1
the/*wildcard can be used to match any elements below the node
/*
Taking the same example again:

        "locations": [
            { "country": "Germany", "city": "Berlin" },
            { "country": "France", "city": "Paris" }
        ],
        "headquarters": { "country": "Belgium", "employees": 250 },
        "exports": [

For example, we could include the/headquarters/employees/?path. This path would ensure that we index theemployeesproperty but wouldn't index extra nested JSON within this property.
/headquarters/employees/?
employees
Include/exclude strategy
Any indexing policy has to include the root path/*as either an included or an excluded path.
/*
Include the root path to selectively exclude paths that don't need to be indexed. This approach is recommended as it lets Azure Cosmos DB proactively index any new property that might be added to your model.

Exclude the root path to selectively include paths that need to be indexed. The partition key property path isn't indexed by default with the exclude strategy and should be explicitly included if needed.

For paths with regular characters that include: alphanumeric characters and _ (underscore), you don't have to escape the path string around double quotes (for example, "/path/?"). For paths with other special characters, you need to escape the path string around double quotes (for example, "/"path-abc"/?"). If you expect special characters in your path, you can escape every path for safety. Functionally, it doesn't make any difference if you escape every path or just the ones that have special characters.

If an explicitly indexed path doesn't exist in an item, a value is added to the index to indicate that the path is undefined.
If an explicitly indexed path doesn't exist in an item, a value is added to the index to indicate that the path is undefined.
All explicitly included paths have values added to the index for each item in the container, even if the path is undefined for a given item.
Seethis sectionfor indexing policy examples for including and excluding paths.
Include/exclude precedence
If your included paths and excluded paths have a conflict, the more precise path takes precedence.
Here's an example:
Included Path:/food/ingredients/nutrition/*
/food/ingredients/nutrition/*
Excluded Path:/food/ingredients/*
/food/ingredients/*
In this case, the included path takes precedence over the excluded path because it's more precise. Based on these paths, any data in thefood/ingredientspath or nested within would be excluded from the index. The exception would be data within the included path:/food/ingredients/nutrition/*, which would be indexed.
food/ingredients
/food/ingredients/nutrition/*
Here are some rules for included and excluded paths precedence in Azure Cosmos DB:
Deeper paths are more precise than narrower paths. for example:/a/b/?is more precise than/a/?.
Deeper paths are more precise than narrower paths. for example:/a/b/?is more precise than/a/?.

Full text indexes
Note
You must enable theFull Text  & Hybrid Search for NoSQL APIpreview feature to specify a full text index.
Full textindexes enable full text search and scoring efficiently using the index. Defining a full text path in an indexing policy can easily be done by including afullTextIndexessection of the indexing policy that contains all of the text paths to be indexed. For example:
fullTextIndexes
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        },
    ],
    "fullTextIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/text"
        }
    ]
}
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        },
    ],
    "fullTextIndexes": [
        {
            "path": "/text"
        }
    ]
}
Important
A full text indexing policy must be on the path defined in the container's full text policy.Learn more about container vector policies.
Vector indexes
Note
You must enable theAzure Cosmos DB NoSQL Vector Search featureto specify a vector index.
Vectorindexes increase the efficiency when performing vector searches using theVectorDistancesystem function. Vectors searches have lower latency, higher throughput, and less RU consumption when applying a vector index.  You can specify the following types of vector index policies:
VectorDistance
flat
quantizedFlat
diskANN
Important
Currently, vector policies and vector indexes are immutable after creation. To make changes, please create a new collection.
A few points to note:
TheflatandquantizedFlatindex types apply Azure Cosmos DB's index to store and read each vector when performing a vector search. Vector searches with aflatindex are brute-force searches and produce 100% accuracy or recall. That is, it's guaranteed to find the most similar vectors in the dataset. However, there's a limitation of505dimensions for vectors on a flat index.ThequantizedFlatindex stores quantized (compressed) vectors on the index. Vector searches withquantizedFlatindex are also brute-force searches, however their accuracy might be slightly less than 100% since the vectors are quantized before adding to the index. However, vector searches withquantized flatshould have lower latency, higher throughput, and lower RU cost than vector searches on aflatindex. This is a good option for scenarios where you're using query filters to narrow down the vector search to a relatively small set of vectors, and high accuracy is required.ThediskANNindex is a separate index defined specifically for vectors applyingDiskANN, a suite of high performance vector indexing algorithms developed by Microsoft Research. DiskANN indexes can offer some of the lowest latency, highest throughput, and lowest RU cost queries, while still maintaining high accuracy. However, since DiskANN is an approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) index, the accuracy might be lower thanquantizedFlatorflat.

    ]
}
Important
A vector indexing policy must be on the path defined in the container's vector policy.Learn more about container vector policies.
Important
The vector path added to the "excludedPaths" section of the indexing policy to ensure optimized performance for insertion. Not adding the vector path to "excludedPaths" will result in higher RU charge and latency for vector insertions.
Spatial indexes
When you define a spatial path in the indexing policy, you should define which indextypeshould be applied to that path. Possible types for spatial indexes include:
type
Point
Point
Polygon
Polygon
MultiPolygon
MultiPolygon
LineString
LineString
Azure Cosmos DB, by default, won't create any spatial indexes. If you would like to use spatial SQL built-in functions, you should create a spatial index on the required properties. Seethis sectionfor indexing policy examples for adding spatial indexes.
Tuple indexes
Tuple Indexes are useful when performing filtering on multiple fields within an array element. Tuple indexes are defined in the includedPaths section of the indexing policy using the tuple specifier â[]â.
Note
Unlike with included or excluded paths, you can't create a path with the /* wildcard. Every tuple path needs to end with â/?â. If a tuple in a tuple path doesn't exist in an item, a value will be added to the index to indicate that the tuple is undefined.
Array tuple paths will be defined in the includedPaths section and will be using the following notation.
<path prefix>/[]/{<tuple 1>, <tuple 2> â¦ <tuple n>}/?
<path prefix>/[]/{<tuple 1>, <tuple 2> â¦ <tuple n>}/?
Note that:
The first part, the path Prefix, is the path that is common between the tuples. It is the path from root to array.  In our example it is â/eventsâ.
Next is the array wildcard specifier â[]â. All array tuple paths should have an array wildcard specifier before the tuple specifier â{}â.
Next is specifying the tuples using the tuple specifier â{}â.
Tuples will be separated by comma.
Tuple needs to use the same path specification as other index paths with a few exceptions:
Tuples should not start with the leading â/â.
Tuples should not have array wildcards.
Tuples should not end â?â or â*â
â?â is the last segment in a tuple path and should be specified immediately after the tuple specifier segment.
For example,
/events/[]/{name, category}/?
/events/[]/{name, category}/?
These are a few examples ofvalidarray tuple paths:
âincludedPathsâ:[  
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/first, name/last}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/first, category}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/first, category/subcategory}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/[1]/first, category}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{[1], [3]}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/city/[1]/events/[]/{name, category}/?â} 
    ]
âincludedPathsâ:[  
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/first, name/last}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/first, category}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/first, category/subcategory}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{name/[1]/first, category}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/events/[]/{[1], [3]}/?â}, 
        {âpathâ: â/city/[1]/events/[]/{name, category}/?â} 
    ]
These are a few examples ofinvalidarray tuple paths
/events/[]/{name/[]/first, category}/?One of the tuples has array wildcard
/events/[]/{name/[]/first, category}/?
One of the tuples has array wildcard
/events/[]/{name, category}/*The last segment in array tuple path should be â?â and not *

Composite indexes
Queries that have anORDER BYclause with two or more properties require a composite index. You can also define a composite index to improve the performance of many equality and range queries. By default, no composite indexes are defined so you shouldadd composite indexesas needed.
ORDER BY
Unlike with included or excluded paths, you can't create a path with the/*wildcard. Every composite path has an implicit/?at the end of the path that you don't need to specify. Composite paths lead to a scalar value that is the only value included in the composite index. If a path in a composite index doesn't exist in an item or leads to a nonscalar value, a value is added to the index to indicate that the path is undefined.
/*
/?
When defining a composite index, you specify:
Two or more property paths. The sequence in which property paths are defined matters.
Two or more property paths. The sequence in which property paths are defined matters.
The order (ascending or descending).
The order (ascending or descending).
Note
When you add a composite index, the query will utilize existing range indexes until the new composite index addition is complete. Therefore, when you add a composite index, you might not immediately observe performance improvements. It is possible to track the progress of index transformationby using one of the SDKs.
ORDER BY queries on multiple properties:
The following considerations are used when using composite indexes for queries with anORDER BYclause with two or more properties.
ORDER BY
If the composite index paths don't match the sequence of the properties in theORDER BYclause, then the composite index can't support the query.
If the composite index paths don't match the sequence of the properties in theORDER BYclause, then the composite index can't support the query.
ORDER BY
The order of composite index paths (ascending or descending) should also match theorderin theORDER BYclause.
The order of composite index paths (ascending or descending) should also match theorderin theORDER BYclause.
order
ORDER BY
The composite index also supports anORDER BYclause with the opposite order on all paths.
The composite index also supports anORDER BYclause with the opposite order on all paths.
ORDER BY
Consider the following example where a composite index is defined on properties name, age, and _ts:
ORDER BY
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c.name ASC, c.age asc
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c.age ASC, c.name asc
No
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c.name DESC, c.age DESC
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c.name ASC, c.age DESC
No
(name ASC, age ASC, timestamp ASC)
SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c.name ASC, c.age ASC, timestamp ASC
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC, timestamp ASC)
SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c.name ASC, c.age ASC
No
You should customize your indexing policy so you can serve all necessaryORDER BYqueries.
ORDER BY
Queries with filters on multiple properties
If a query has filters on two or more properties, it might be helpful to create a composite index for these properties.
For example, consider the following query that has both an equality and range filter:
SELECT *
FROM c
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18
SELECT *
FROM c
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18
This query is more efficient, taking less time and consuming fewer RUs, if it's able to apply a composite index on(name ASC, age ASC).
(name ASC, age ASC)
Queries with multiple range filters can also be optimized with a composite index. However, each individual composite index can only optimize a single range filter. Range filters include>,<,<=,>=, and!=. The range filter should be defined last in the composite index.
>
<
<=
>=
!=
Consider the following query with an equality filter and two range filters:
SELECT *
FROM c
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18 AND c._ts > 1612212188
SELECT *
FROM c
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18 AND c._ts > 1612212188
This query is more efficient with a composite index on(name ASC, age ASC)and(name ASC, _ts ASC). However, the query wouldn't utilize a composite index on(age ASC, name ASC)because the properties with equality filters must be defined first in the composite index. Two separate composite indexes are required instead of a single composite index on(name ASC, age ASC, _ts ASC)since each composite index can only optimize a single range filter.
(name ASC, age ASC)
(name ASC, _ts ASC)
(age ASC, name ASC)
(name ASC, age ASC, _ts ASC)
The following considerations are used when creating composite indexes for queries with filters on multiple properties
Filter expressions can use multiple composite indexes.
The properties in the query's filter should match those in composite index. If a property is in the composite index but isn't included in the query as a filter, the query won't utilize the composite index.
If a query has other properties in the filter that aren't defined in a composite index, then a combination of composite and range indexes are used to evaluate the query. This requires fewer RUs than exclusively using range indexes.
If a property has a range filter (>,<,<=,>=, or!=), then this property should be defined last in the composite index. If a query has more than one range filter, it might benefit from multiple composite indexes.
>
<
<=
>=
!=
When creating a composite index to optimize queries with multiple filters, theORDERof the composite index has no impact on the results. This property is optional.
ORDER
Consider the following examples where a composite index is defined on properties name, age, and timestamp:
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age = 18
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18
Yes
(name DESC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age > 18
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name != "John" AND c.age > 18
No
(name ASC, age ASC, timestamp ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age = 18 AND c.timestamp > 123049923
Yes
(name ASC, age ASC, timestamp ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age < 18 AND c.timestamp = 123049923
No
(name ASC, age ASC) and (name ASC, timestamp ASC)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age < 18 AND c.timestamp > 123049923
Yes
Queries with a filter and ORDER BY
If a query filters on one or more properties and has different properties in the ORDER BY clause, it might be helpful to add the properties in the filter to theORDER BYclause.
ORDER BY
For example, by adding the properties in the filter to theORDER BYclause, the following query could be rewritten to apply a composite index:
ORDER BY
Query using range index:
SELECT *
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John" 
ORDER BY c.timestamp
SELECT *
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John" 
ORDER BY c.timestamp
Query using composite index:
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John"
ORDER BY c.name, c.timestamp
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John"
ORDER BY c.name, c.timestamp
The same query optimizations can be generalized for anyORDER BYqueries with filters, keeping in mind that individual composite indexes can only support, at most, one range filter.
ORDER BY
Query using range index:
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age = 18 AND c.timestamp > 1611947901 
ORDER BY c.timestamp
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age = 18 AND c.timestamp > 1611947901 
ORDER BY c.timestamp
Query using composite index:
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age = 18 AND c.timestamp > 1611947901 
ORDER BY c.name, c.age, c.timestamp
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.name = "John" AND c.age = 18 AND c.timestamp > 1611947901 
ORDER BY c.name, c.age, c.timestamp
In addition, you can use composite indexes to optimize queries with system functions and ORDER BY:
Query using range index:
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.firstName = "John" AND Contains(c.lastName, "Smith", true) 
ORDER BY c.lastName
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.firstName = "John" AND Contains(c.lastName, "Smith", true) 
ORDER BY c.lastName
Query using composite index:
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.firstName = "John" AND Contains(c.lastName, "Smith", true) 
ORDER BY c.firstName, c.lastName
SELECT * 
FROM c 
WHERE c.firstName = "John" AND Contains(c.lastName, "Smith", true) 
ORDER BY c.firstName, c.lastName
The following considerations apply when creating composite indexes to optimize a query with a filter andORDER BYclause:
ORDER BY
If you don't define a composite index on a query with a filter on one property and a separateORDER BYclause using a different property, the query will still succeed. However, the RU cost of the query can be reduced with a composite index, particularly if the property in theORDER BYclause has a high cardinality.
ORDER BY
ORDER BY
If the query filters on properties, these properties should be included first in theORDER BYclause.
ORDER BY
If the query filters on multiple properties, the equality filters must be the first properties in theORDER BYclause.
ORDER BY
If the query filters on multiple properties, you can have a maximum of one range filter or system function utilized per composite index. The property used in the range filter or system function should be defined last in the composite index.
All considerations for creating composite indexes forORDER BYqueries with multiple properties and queries with filters on multiple properties still apply.

Queries with a filter and an aggregate
If a query filters on one or more properties and has an aggregate system function, it might be helpful to create a composite index for the properties in the filter and aggregate system function. This optimization applies to theSUMandAVGsystem functions.
The following considerations apply when creating composite indexes to optimize a query with a filter and aggregate system function.
Composite indexes are optional when running queries with aggregates. However, the RU cost of the query can often be reduced with a composite index.
If the query filters on multiple properties, the equality filters must be the first properties in the composite index.
You can have a maximum of one range filter per composite index and it must be on the property in the aggregate system function.
The property in the aggregate system function should be defined last in the composite index.
Theorder(ASCorDESC) doesn't matter.

Composite indexes with an array wildcard
Below is an example for a composite index that contains an array wildcard.
{  
    "automatic":true,
    "indexingMode":"Consistent",
    "includedPaths":[  
        {  
            "path":"/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths":[],
    "compositeIndexes":[  
        [  
            {"path":"/familyname", "order":"ascending"},
            {"path":"/children/[]/age", "order":"descending"}
        ]
    ]
}
{  
    "automatic":true,
    "indexingMode":"Consistent",
    "includedPaths":[  
        {  
            "path":"/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths":[],
    "compositeIndexes":[  
        [  
            {"path":"/familyname", "order":"ascending"},
            {"path":"/children/[]/age", "order":"descending"}
        ]
    ]
}
An example query that can benefit from this composite index is:
SELECT r.id
FROM root r
JOIN ch IN r.children
WHERE r.familyname = 'Anderson' AND ch.age > 20
SELECT r.id
FROM root r
JOIN ch IN r.children
WHERE r.familyname = 'Anderson' AND ch.age > 20
Modifying the indexing policy
A container's indexing policy can be updated at any timeby using the Azure portal or one of the supported SDKs. An update to the indexing policy triggers a transformation from the old index to the new one, which is performed online and in-place (so no extra storage space is consumed during the operation). The old indexing policy is efficiently transformed to the new policy without affecting the write availability, read availability, or the throughput provisioned on the container. Index transformation is an asynchronous operation, and the time it takes to complete depends on the provisioned throughput, the number of items and their size. If multiple indexing policy updates have to be made, it's recommended to do all the changes as a single operation in order to have the index transformation complete as quickly as possible.
Important
Index transformation is an operation that consumesrequest units.
Note
You can track the progress of index transformation in theAzure portalor byusing one of the SDKs.
There's no impact to write availability during any index transformations. The index transformation uses your provisioned RUs but at a lower priority than your CRUD operations or queries.
There's no impact to read availability when adding new indexed paths. Queries will only utilize new indexed paths once an index transformation is complete. In other words, when adding a new indexed path, queries that benefit from that indexed path has the same performance before and during the index transformation. After the index transformation is complete, the query engine will begin to use the new indexed paths.
When removing indexed paths, you should group all your changes into one indexing policy transformation. If you remove multiple indexes and do so in one single indexing policy change, the query engine provides consistent and complete results throughout the index transformation. However, if you remove indexes through multiple indexing policy changes, the query engine won't provide consistent or complete results until all index transformations complete. Most developers don't drop indexes and then immediately try to run queries that utilize these indexes so, in practice, this situation is unlikely.
When you drop an indexed path, the query engine will immediately stop using it, and will do a full scan instead.
Note
Where possible, you should always try to group multiple index removals into one single indexing policy modification.
Important
Removing an index takes effect immediately, whereas adding a new index takes some time as it requires an indexing transformation. When replacing one index with another (for example, replacing a single property index with a composite-index) make sure to add the new index first and then wait for the index transformation to completebeforeyou remove the previous index from the indexing policy. Otherwise this will negatively affect your ability to query the previous index and might break any active workloads that reference the previous index.
Indexing policies and TTL
Using theTime-to-Live (TTL) featurerequires indexing. This means that:
it isn't possible to activate TTL on a container where the indexing mode is set tonone,
none
it isn't possible to set the indexing mode to None on a container where TTL is activated.
For scenarios where no property path needs to be indexed, but TTL is required, you can use an indexing policy with an indexing mode set toconsistent, no included paths, and/*as the only excluded path.
