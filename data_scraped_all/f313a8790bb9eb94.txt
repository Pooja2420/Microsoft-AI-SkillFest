ExpressRoute
You can link up to 10 virtual networks to a standard ExpressRoute circuit. All virtual networks must be in the same geopolitical region when using a standard ExpressRoute circuit.

A single virtual network can be linked to up to 16 ExpressRoute circuits. Use the following process to create a new connection object for each ExpressRoute circuit you're connecting to. The ExpressRoute circuits can be in the same subscription, different subscriptions, or a mix of both.

If you enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on, you can link virtual networks outside of the geopolitical region of the ExpressRoute circuit. The premium add-on also allows you to connect more than 10 virtual networks to your ExpressRoute circuit depending on the bandwidth chosen. Check theFAQfor more details on the premium add-on.

Note
BGP configuration information will not appear if the layer 3 provider configured your peerings. If your circuit is in a provisioned state, you should be able to create connections.
To create a connection

Select the resiliency type for your connection. You can chooseMaximum resiliencyorStandard resiliency.Maximum resiliency (Recommended)- This option provides the highest level of resiliency to your virtual network. It provides two redundant connections from the virtual network gateway to two different ExpressRoute circuits in different ExpressRoute locations.NoteMaximum Resiliency provides maximum protection against location wide outages and connectivity failures in an ExpressRoute location. This option is strongly recommended for all critical and production workloads.High resiliency- This option provides a single redundant connection from the virtual network gateway to a Metro ExpressRoute circuit. Metro circuits provide redundancy across ExpressRoute peering locations. Whereas, unlike maximum resiliency, there is no redundancy within the peering locations.Standard resiliency- This option provides a single redundant connection from the virtual network gateway to a single ExpressRoute circuit.NoteStandard resiliency does not provide protection against location wide outages. This option is suitable for non-critical and non-production workloads.

When selecting an ExpressRoute circuit for the second connection, you are provided with the distance from the first ExpressRoute circuit. This information appears in the diagram and can help you select the second ExpressRoute location.

To have maximum resiliency, you should select two circuits in different peering location. You'll be given the following warning if you select two circuits in the same peering location.

High/Standard resiliency
For high or standard resiliency, you only need to enter information for one connection. For high resiliency the connection you need to attach a metro circuit.  For standard resiliency the connection you need to attach a regular (non-metro) circuit.
After your connection has been successfully configured, your connection object will show the information for the connection.

Connect a virtual network to a circuit - different subscription
You can share an ExpressRoute circuit across multiple subscriptions. The following figure shows a simple schematic of how sharing works for ExpressRoute circuits across multiple subscriptions.

Each of the smaller clouds within the large cloud is used to represent subscriptions that belong to different departments within an organization. Each of the departments within the organization uses their own subscription for deploying their services--but they can share a single ExpressRoute circuit to connect back to your on-premises network. A single department (in this example: IT) can own the ExpressRoute circuit. Other subscriptions within the organization may use the ExpressRoute circuit.
Note
Connecting virtual networks between Azure sovereign clouds and Public Azure cloud is not supported. You can only link virtual networks from different subscriptions in the same cloud.
Connectivity and bandwidth charges for the dedicated circuit will be applied to the ExpressRoute circuit owner. All virtual networks share the same bandwidth.
Administration - About circuit owners and circuit users
The 'circuit owner' is an authorized Power User of the ExpressRoute circuit resource. The circuit owner can create authorizations that can be redeemed by 'circuit users'. Circuit users are owners of virtual network gateways that aren't within the same subscription as the ExpressRoute circuit. Circuit users can redeem authorizations (one authorization per virtual network).
The circuit owner has the power to modify and revoke authorizations at any time. Revoking an authorization results in all link connections being deleted from the subscription whose access was revoked.
Note
Circuit owner is not an built-in RBAC role or defined on the ExpressRoute resource.
The definition of the circuit owner is any role with the following access:
Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/authorizations/write
Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/authorizations/read
Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/authorizations/delete
This includes the built-in roles such as Contributor, Owner and Network Contributor. Detailed description for the differentbuilt-in roles.
Circuit owner operations
To create a connection authorization
The circuit owner creates an authorization, which creates an authorization key to be used by a circuit user to connect their virtual network gateways to the ExpressRoute circuit. An authorization is valid for only one connection.
Note
Each connection requires a separate authorization.
In the ExpressRoute page, selectAuthorizationsand then type anamefor the authorization and selectSave.
In the ExpressRoute page, selectAuthorizationsand then type anamefor the authorization and selectSave.
Once the configuration is saved, copy theResource IDand theAuthorization Key.
Once the configuration is saved, copy theResource IDand theAuthorization Key.

To delete a connection authorization
You can delete a connection by selecting theDeleteicon for the authorization key for your connection.

If you want to delete the connection but retain the authorization key, you can delete the connection from the connection page of the circuit.
Note
To view your Gateway connections, go to your ExpressRoute circuit in Azure portal. From there, navigate toConnectionsunderneathSettingsfor your ExpressRoute circuit. This will show you each ExpressRoute gateway that your circuit is connected to. If the gateway is under a different subscription than the circuit, thePeerfield will display the circuit authorization key.
Circuit user operations
The circuit user needs the resource ID and an authorization key from the circuit owner.

Configure ExpressRoute FastPath
FastPathimproves data path performance such as packets per second and connections per second between your on-premises network and your virtual network. You can enable FastPath if your virtual network gateway is Ultra Performance or ErGw3AZ.
Note
When you enable FastPath on new or existing connections, the Gateway bypass is enabled after the ExpressRoute Gateway and Circuit connection is established. This will briefly route the on-premises traffic through the gateway.
Configure FastPath on a new connection
When adding a new connection for your ExpressRoute gateway, select the checkbox forFastPath.

Configure FastPath on an existing connection
Go to the existing connection resource either from the ExpressRoute gateway, the ExpressRoute circuit, or the Connection resource page.
