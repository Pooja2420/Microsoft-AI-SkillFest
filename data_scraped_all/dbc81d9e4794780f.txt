APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
Thelimit-concurrencypolicy prevents enclosed policies from executing by more than the specified number of requests at any time. When that number is exceeded, new requests will fail immediately with the429Too Many Requests status code.

429
Caution
Due to the distributed nature of throttling architecture, rate limiting is never completely accurate. The difference between the configured and the actual number of allowed requests varies based on request volume and rate, backend latency, and other factors.
Note
Set the policy's elements and child elements in the order provided in the policy statement. Learn more abouthow to set or edit API Management policies.
Policy statement
<limit-concurrency key="expression" max-count="number">
        <!â nested policy statements -->
</limit-concurrency>
<limit-concurrency key="expression" max-count="number">
        <!â nested policy statements -->
</limit-concurrency>
Attributes
Usage
Policy sections:inbound, outbound, backend, on-error
Policy scopes:global, workspace, product, API, operation
Gateways:classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted, workspace
Usage notes
The maximum number of requests enforced by API Management is lower when multiple capacity units are deployed in a region.
Example
The following example demonstrates how to limit number of requests forwarded to a backend based on the value of a context variable.
<policies>
  <inbound>â¦</inbound>
  <backend>
    <limit-concurrency key="@((string)context.Variables["connectionId"])" max-count="3">
      <forward-request timeout="120"/>
    </limit-concurrency>
  </backend>
  <outbound>â¦</outbound>
</policies>
<policies>
  <inbound>â¦</inbound>
  <backend>
    <limit-concurrency key="@((string)context.Variables["connectionId"])" max-count="3">

    </limit-concurrency>

  <outbound>â¦</outbound>
