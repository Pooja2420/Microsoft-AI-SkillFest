Deploy WebJobs by using theAzure portalto upload an executable or script. You can run background tasks in the Azure App Service.
If instead of the Azure App Service, you're using Visual Studio to develop and deploy WebJobs, seeDeploy WebJobs using Visual Studio.
Note
WebJobs forWindows container,Linux code, andLinux containeris in preview. WebJobs for Windows code is generally available and not in preview.
Overview
WebJobs is a feature ofAzure App Servicethat enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app. All app service plans support WebJobs. There's no extra cost to use WebJobs.
You can use the Azure WebJobs SDK with WebJobs to simplify many programming tasks. For more information, seeWhat is the WebJobs SDK.
Azure Functions provides another way to run programs and scripts. For a comparison between WebJobs and Functions, seeChoose between Flow, Logic Apps, Functions, and WebJobs.
WebJob types
Supported file types for scripts or programs
Windows code
Windows container
Linux code
Linux container
The following file types are supported:.cmd,.bat,.exe(using Windows cmd).ps1(using PowerShell).sh(using Bash).js(using Node.js).jar(using Java)The necessary runtimes to run these file types are already installed on the web app instance.
Note
WebJobs for Windows container is in preview.
The following file types are supported:.cmd,.bat,.exe(using Windows cmd)In addition to these file types, WebJobs written in the language runtime of the Windows container app.Example: .jar and .war scripts if the container is a Java app.
Note
WebJobs for Linux code is in preview.
.shscripts are supported.In addition to shell scripts, WebJobs written in the language of the selected runtime are also supported.Example: Python (.py) scripts if the main site is a Python code app.
Note
WebJobs for Linux container is in preview.
.shscripts are supported.In addition to shell scripts, WebJobs written in the language runtime of the Linux container app are also supported.Example: Node (.js) scripts if the site is a Node.js app.
Continuous vs. triggered WebJobs
The following table describes the differences betweencontinuousandtriggeredWebJobs:
\site\wwwroot\app_data\Jobs\Continuous
\site\wwwroot\app_data\Jobs\Triggered
Note
A web app can time out after 20 minutes of inactivity, and only requests to the actual web app can reset the timer. Viewing the app's configuration in the Azure portal or making requests to the advanced tools site (https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net) doesn't reset the timer. If you set the web app that hosts your job to run continuously, run on a schedule, or use event-driven triggers, enable theAlways onsetting on your web app's AzureConfigurationpane. TheAlways onsetting helps make sure that these kinds of WebJobs run reliably. This feature is available only in the Basic, Standard, and Premiumpricing tiers.

Create a continuous WebJob
Important
When you have source control configured for your application, Webjobs should be deployed as part of the source control integration. After source control is configured for your application, a WebJob can't be added from the Azure portal.
In theAzure portal, go to theApp Servicepage of your App Service web app, API app, or mobile app.

Determines whether the program or script runs on all instances or one instance. The option to run on multiple instances doesn't apply to the Free or Sharedpricing tiers.

Create a scheduled WebJob
A scheduled Webjob is also triggered. You can schedule the trigger to occur automatically on the schedule you specify.
In theAzure portal, go to theApp Servicepage of your App Service web app, API app, or mobile app.

NCRONTAB expressions
You can enter aNCRONTAB expressionin the portal or include asettings.jobfile at the root of your WebJob.zipfile, as in the following example:
settings.job
{
    "schedule": "0 */15 * * * *"
}
{
    "schedule": "0 */15 * * * *"
}
To learn more, seeScheduling a triggered WebJob.
Note
The default time zone used to run CRON expressions is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To have your CRON expression run based on another time zone, create an app setting for your function app named WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE. To learn more, seeNCRONTAB time zones.
Manage WebJobs
You can manage the running state individual WebJobs running in your site in theAzure portal. Go toSettings>WebJobs, choose the WebJob, and you can start and stop the WebJob. You can also view and modify the password of the webhook that runs the WebJob.
You can alsoadd an application settingnamedWEBJOBS_STOPPEDwith a value of1to stop all WebJobs running on your site. You can use this method to prevent conflicting WebJobs from running both in staging and production slots. You can similarly use a value of1for theWEBJOBS_DISABLE_SCHEDULEsetting to disable triggered WebJobs in the site or a staging slot. For slots, remember to enable theDeployment slot settingoption so that the setting itself doesn't get swapped.

WebJob statuses
The following is a list of common WebJob statuses:
InitializingThe app has started and the WebJob is going through its initialization process.
StartingThe WebJob is starting up.
RunningThe WebJob is running.
PendingRestartA continuous WebJob exits in less than two minutes since it started for any reason, and App Service waits 60 seconds before restarting the WebJob. If the continuous WebJob exits after the two-minute mark, App Service doesn't wait the 60 seconds and restarts the WebJob immediately.
StoppedThe WebJob was stopped (usually from the Azure portal) and is currently not running and won't run until you start it again manually, even for a continuous or scheduled WebJob.
AbortedThis can occur for many of reasons, such as when a long-running WebJob reaches the timeout marker.
