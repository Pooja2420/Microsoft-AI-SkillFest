This article helps you connect your virtual networks using the VNet-to-VNet connection type in the Azure portal. When you use the portal to connect virtual networks using VNet-to-VNet, the virtual networks can be in different regions, but must be in the same subscription. If your virtual networks are in different subscriptions, use thePowerShellinstructions instead. This article doesn't apply to virtual network peering. For virtual network peering, see theVirtual Network peeringarticle.

About VNet-to-VNet connections
Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a simple way to connect virtual networks. When you connect a virtual network to another virtual network with a VNet-to-VNet connection type, it's similar to creating a site-to-site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connection types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel with IPsec/IKE and function the same way when communicating. However, they differ in the way the local network gateway is configured.
When you create a VNet-to-VNet connection, the local network gateway address space is automatically created and populated. However, the local network gateway isn't visible in this configuration. That means that you can't configure it manually.

If you update the address space for one VNet, the other VNet automatically routes to the updated address space.
If you update the address space for one VNet, the other VNet automatically routes to the updated address space.
It's typically faster and easier to create a VNet-to-VNet connection than a site-to-site connection.

If you know you want to specify more address spaces for the local network gateway, or plan to add more connections later and need to adjust the local network gateway, create the configuration using thesite-to-site connectionsteps instead.

The VNet-to-VNet connection doesn't include point-to-site client pool address space. If you need transitive routing for point-to-site clients, then create a site-to-site connection between the virtual network gateways, or use virtual network peering.

Why create a VNet-to-VNet connection?
You might want to connect virtual networks by using a VNet-to-VNet connection for the following reasons:
Cross region geo-redundancy and geo-presenceYou can set up your own geo-replication or synchronization with secure connectivity without going over internet-facing endpoints.With Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer, you can set up highly available workload with geo-redundancy across multiple Azure regions. For example, you can set up SQL Server Always On availability groups across multiple Azure regions.

Regional multi-tier applications with isolation or administrative boundariesWithin the same region, you can set up multi-tier applications with multiple virtual networks that are connected together because of isolation or administrative requirements. VNet-to-VNet communication can be combined with multi-site configurations. These configurations let you establish network topologies that combine cross-premises connectivity with inter-virtual network connectivity, as shown in the following diagram:

Create and configure VNet1
If you already have a VNet, verify that the settings are compatible with your VPN gateway design. Pay particular attention to any subnets that might overlap with other networks. Your connection won't work properly if you have overlapping subnets.
In this section, create VNet1 using the following values. If you're using your own values, make sure the address spaces don't overlap with any of the virtual networks to which you want to connect.

Create the gateway subnet
The virtual network gateway requires a specific subnet namedGatewaySubnet. The gateway subnet is part of the IP address range for your virtual network and contains the IP addresses that the virtual network gateway resources and services use.
When you create the gateway subnet, you specify the number of IP addresses that the subnet contains. The number of IP addresses needed depends on the VPN gateway configuration that you want to create. Some configurations require more IP addresses than others. It's best to specify /27 or larger (/26, /25, etc.) for your gateway subnet.
On the page for your virtual network, on the left pane, selectSubnetsto open theSubnetspage.
At the top of the page, select+ Subnetto open theAdd subnetpane.
ForSubnet purpose, selectVirtual Network Gatewayfrom the dropdown.
The name is automatically entered asGatewaySubnet. Adjust starting IP address and size if necessary. For example,10.1.255.0/27.
Don't adjust the other values on the page. ClickAddto add the subnet.
Important
NSGs on the gateway subnet aren't supported. Associating a network security group to this subnet might cause your virtual network gateway (VPN and ExpressRoute gateways) to stop functioning as expected. For more information about network security groups, seeWhat is a network security group?.
Create the VNet1 VPN gateway
In this step, you create the virtual network gateway for your virtual network. Creating a gateway can often take 45 minutes or more, depending on the selected gateway SKU. For gateway SKU pricing, seePricing.

Create and configure VNet4
After you've configured VNet1, create VNet4 and the VNet4 gateway by repeating the previous steps and replacing the values with VNet4 values. You don't need to wait until the virtual network gateway for VNet1 has finished creating before you configure VNet4. If you're using your own values, make sure the address spaces don't overlap with any of the virtual networks to which you want to connect.
You can use the following examples values to configure VNet4 and the VNet4 gateway.

Configure your connections
When the VPN gateways for both VNet1 and VNet4 have completed, you can create your virtual network gateway connections.
Virtual networks in the same subscription can be connected using the portal, even if they are in different resource groups. However, if your virtual networks are in different subscriptions, you must usePowerShellor CLI to make the connections.
You can create either a bidirectional, or a single direction connection. For this exercise, we'll specify a bidirectional connection. The bidirectional connection value creates two separate connections so that traffic can flow in both directions.
In the portal, go toVNet1GW.
