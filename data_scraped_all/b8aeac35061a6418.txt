Thequota-by-keypolicy enforces a renewable or lifetime call volume and/or bandwidth quota, on a per key basis. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression. Optional increment condition can be added to specify which requests should be counted towards the quota. If multiple policies would increment the same key value, it is incremented only once per request. When the quota is exceeded, the caller receives a403 Forbiddenresponse status code, and the response includes aRetry-Afterheader whose value is the recommended retry interval in seconds.

To understand the difference between rate limits and quotas,see Rate limits and quotas.
Note
When underlying compute resources restart in the service platform, API Management may continue to handle requests for a short period after a quota is reached.
Note
Set the policy's elements and child elements in the order provided in the policy statement. To help you configure this policy, the portal provides a guided, form-based editor. Learn more abouthow to set or edit API Management policies.

Thecounter-keyattribute value must be unique across all the APIs in the API Management instance if you don't want to share the total between the other APIs.
