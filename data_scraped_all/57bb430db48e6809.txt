Advanced Container Networking Services is a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. The suite addresses challenges in modern containerized applications, such as observability, security, and compliance.
With Advanced Container Networking Services, the focus is on delivering a seamless and integrated experience that enables you to maintain robust security postures and gain deep insights into your network traffic and application performance. This ensures that your containerized applications are not only secure but also meet or exceed your performance and reliability goals, allowing you to confidently manage and scale your infrastructure.
What is included in Advanced Container Networking Services?
Advanced Container Networking Services contains features split into two pillars:
Observability: The inaugural feature of the Advanced Container Networking Services suite bringing the power of Hubbleâs control plane to both Cilium and non-Cilium Linux data planes. These features aim to provide visibility into networking and performance.

Security: For clusters using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium, network policies include fully qualified domain name (FQDN) filtering for tackling the complexities of maintaining configuration.

Container Network Observability
Container Network Observability equips you with network related monitoring and diagnostics tools, providing  visibility into your containerized workloads. It unlocks Hubble metrics, Hubbleâs command line interface (CLI) and the Hubble user interface (UI) on your AKS clusters providing deep, actionable insights into your containerized workloads allowing you to detect and determine the root causes of network-related issues in AKS. These features ensure that your containerized applications are secure and compliant in order to enable you to confidently manage your infrastructure.
For more information about Container Network Observability, seeWhat is Container Network Observability?.
Container Network Security
Container Network Security features within Advanced Container Networking Services enable greater control over network security policies for ease of use when implementing across clusters. Clusters using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium have access to DNS-based policies. The ease of use compared to IP-based policies allows restricting egress access to external services using domain names. Configuration management becomes simplified by using FQDN rather than dynamically changing IPs.

Create a resource group
A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Create a resource group using theaz group createcommand.
az group create
# Set environment variables for the resource group name and location. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>"
export LOCATION="<azure-region>"
# Create a resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
# Set environment variables for the resource group name and location. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>"
export LOCATION="<azure-region>"
# Create a resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
Enable and Disable Advanced Container Networking Services in AKS cluster
Theaz aks createcommand with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag,--enable-acns, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:
az aks create
--enable-acns

Theaz aks updatecommand with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag,--enable-acns, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features which includesContainer Network Observabilityand theContainer Network Securityfeature.
az aks update
--enable-acns
Note
Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --enable-acns
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --enable-acns
Disable Advanced Container Networking Services
The--disable-acnsflag disables all Advanced Container Networking Services features on an existing AKS cluster which includes Container Network Observability and Container Network Security
--disable-acns
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --disable-acns
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \

Cilium
Non-Cilium
To disable Container Network Observability features without affecting other Advanced Container Networking Services features, use--enable-acnsand--disable-acns-observability
--enable-acns
--disable-acns-observability
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
