You can use the Azure portal to create aconfidential VMbased on an Azure Marketplace image quickly. There are multipleconfidential VM options on AMD and Intelwith AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX technology.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. Free trial accounts don't have access to the VMs used in this tutorial. One option is to use apay as you go subscription.

If you're using a Linux-based confidential VM, use a BASH shell for SSH or install an SSH client, such asPuTTY.

Select or search forVirtual machines.
Select or search forVirtual machines.
On theVirtual machinespage menu, selectCreate>Virtual machine.
On theVirtual machinespage menu, selectCreate>Virtual machine.
On the tabBasics, configure the following settings:a. UnderProject details, forSubscription, select an Azure subscription that meets theprerequisites.b. ForResource Group, selectCreate newto create a new resource group. Enter a name, and selectOK.c. UnderInstance details, forVirtual machine name, enter a name for your new VM.d. ForRegion, select the Azure region in which to deploy your VM.NoteConfidential VMs are not available in all locations. For currently supported locations, see whichVM products are available by Azure region.e. ForAvailability options, selectNo infrastructure redundancy requiredfor singular VMs orVirtual machine scale setfor multiple VMs.f. ForSecurity Type, selectConfidential virtual machines.g. ForImage, select the OS image to use for your VM. SelectSee all imagesto open Azure Marketplace. Select the filterSecurity Type>Confidentialto show all available confidential VM images.h.

Connect to confidential VM
There are different methods to connect toWindows confidential VMsandLinux confidential VMs.
Connect to Windows VMs
To connect to a confidential VM with a Windows OS, seeHow to connect and sign on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows.
Connect to Linux VMs
To connect to a confidential VM with a Linux OS, see the instructions for your computer's OS.
Before you begin, make sure you have your VM's public IP address. To find the IP address:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Select or search forVirtual machines.
Select or search forVirtual machines.
On theVirtual machinespage, select your confidential VM.
On theVirtual machinespage, select your confidential VM.
On your confidential VM's overview page, copy thePublic IP address.For more information about connecting to Linux VMs, seeQuickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal.
On your confidential VM's overview page, copy thePublic IP address.
For more information about connecting to Linux VMs, seeQuickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal.
Open your SSH client, such as PuTTY.
Open your SSH client, such as PuTTY.
Enter your confidential VM's public IP address.
Enter your confidential VM's public IP address.
Connect to the VM. In PuTTY, selectOpen.
Connect to the VM. In PuTTY, selectOpen.
Enter your VM administrator username and password.NoteIf you're using PuTTY, you might receive a security alert that the server's host key isn't cached in the registry. If you trust the host, selectYesto add the key to PuTTY's cache and continue connecting. To connect just once, without adding the key, selectNo. If you don't trust the host, selectCancelto abandon your connection.
Enter your VM administrator username and password.
