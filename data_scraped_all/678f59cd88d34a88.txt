Azure Monitor supports multiple methods to install the Azure Monitor agent and connect your machine or server registered with Azure Arc-enabled servers to the service. Azure Arc-enabled servers support the Azure VM extension framework, which provides post-deployment configuration and automation tasks, enabling you to simplify management of your hybrid machines like you can with Azure VMs.
The Azure Monitor agent is required if you want to:
Monitor the operating system and any workloads running on the machine or server usingVM insights
Analyze and alert usingAzure Monitor
Perform security monitoring in Azure by usingMicrosoft Defender for CloudorMicrosoft Sentinel
Collect inventory and track changes by usingAzure Monitor agent.
Note
Azure Monitor agent logs are stored locally and are updated after temporary disconnection of an Arc-enabled machine.
This article reviews the deployment methods for the Azure Monitor agent VM extension, across multiple production physical servers or virtual machines in your environment, to help you determine which works best for your organization. If you are interested in the new Azure Monitor agent and want to see a detailed comparison, seeAzure Monitor agents overview.
Installation options
Review the different methods to install the VM extension using one method or a combination and determine which one works best for your scenario.
Use Azure Arc-enabled servers
This method supports managing the installation, management, and removal of VM extensions (including the Azure Monitor agent) from theAzure portal, usingPowerShell, theAzure CLI, or with anAzure Resource Manager (ARM) template.
Can be useful for testing purposes
Useful if you have a few machines to manage
Limited automation when using an Azure Resource Manager template
Can only focus on a single Arc-enabled server, and not multiple instances
Only supports specifying a single workspace to report to; requires using PowerShell or the Azure CLI to configure the Log Analytics Windows agent VM extension to report to up to four workspaces
Doesn't support deploying the Dependency agent from the portal; you can only use PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or ARM template
Use Azure Policy
You can use Azure Policy to deploy the Azure Monitor agent VM extension at-scale to machines in your environment, and maintain configuration compliance. This is accomplished by using either theConfigure Linux Arc-enabled machines to run Azure Monitor Agentor theConfigure Windows Arc-enabled machines to run Azure Monitor Agentpolicy definition.
Azure Policy includes several prebuilt definitions related to Azure Monitor. For a complete list of the built-in policies in theMonitoringcategory, seeAzure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Monitor.
Reinstalls the VM extension if removed (after policy evaluation)
Identifies and installs the VM extension when a new Azure Arc-enabled server is registered with Azure
TheConfigureoperating systemArc-enabled machines to run Azure Monitor Agentpolicy only installs the Azure Monitor agent extension and configures the agent to report to a specified Log Analytics workspace.
Standard compliance evaluation cycle is once every 24 hours. An evaluation scan for a subscription or a resource group can be started with Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, a call to the REST API, or by using the Azure Policy Compliance Scan GitHub Action. For more information, seeEvaluation triggers.
Use Azure Automation
The process automation operating environment in Azure Automation and its support for PowerShell and Python runbooks can help you automate the deployment of the Azure Monitor agent VM extension at scale to machines in your environment.
Can use a scripted method to automate its deployment and configuration using scripting languages you're familiar with
Runs on a schedule that you define and control
Authenticate securely to Arc-enabled servers from the Automation account using a managed identity
Requires an Azure Automation account
Experience authoring and managing runbooks in Azure Automation
Must create a runbook based on PowerShell or Python, depending on the target operating system
Use Azure portal
The Azure Monitor agent VM extension can be installed using the Azure portal. SeeAutomatic extension upgrade for Azure Arc-enabled serversfor more information about installing extensions from the Azure portal.
Point and click directly from Azure portal
Useful for testing with small set of servers
Immediate deployment of extension
Not scalable to many servers
Limited automation
