ExpressRoute Direct gives you the ability to connect directly into the Microsoft global network at peering locations strategically distributed around the world. ExpressRoute Direct provides dual 100-Gbps or 10-Gbps connectivity that supports active-active connectivity at scale. You can work with any service provider to set up ExpressRoute Direct.
Key features include, but not limited to:
Large data ingestion into services like Azure Storage and Azure Cosmos DB.
Physical isolation for industries that regulates and require dedicated or isolated connectivity such as banks, government, and retail companies.
Granular control of circuit distribution based on business unit.
Onboard to ExpressRoute Direct
Before you can set up ExpressRoute Direct, you must first enroll your subscription. Run the following commands using Azure PowerShell:
Sign in to Azure and select the subscription you wish to enroll.Connect-AzAccount 

Select-AzSubscription -Subscription "<SubscriptionID or SubscriptionName>"
Sign in to Azure and select the subscription you wish to enroll.
Connect-AzAccount 

Select-AzSubscription -Subscription "<SubscriptionID or SubscriptionName>"
Connect-AzAccount 

Select-AzSubscription -Subscription "<SubscriptionID or SubscriptionName>"
Register your subscription toAllowExpressRoutePortsusing the following command:Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowExpressRoutePorts -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Register your subscription toAllowExpressRoutePortsusing the following command:
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowExpressRoutePorts -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowExpressRoutePorts -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
Once enrolled, verify thatMicrosoft.Networkresource provider is registered to your subscription. Registering a resource provider configures your subscription to work with the resource provider.
Access your subscription settings as described inAzure resource providers and types.
Access your subscription settings as described inAzure resource providers and types.
In your subscription, forResource Providers, verifyMicrosoft.Networkprovider shows aRegisteredstatus. If the Microsoft.Network resource provider isn't present in the list of registered providers, add it.

If you start using ExpressRoute Direct and find that ports at your selected peering location are unavailable, submit a support ticket to request more inventories.

ExpressRoute Direct circuits
Azure ExpressRoute allows you to extend your on-premises network into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection made possible through a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft 365.
Each peering location has access to the Microsoft global network and can access any region in a geopolitical zone by default. You can access any global regions when you set up a premium circuit.
The functionality in most scenarios is equivalent to circuits that use an ExpressRoute service provider to operate. To support further granularity and new capabilities offered using ExpressRoute Direct, there are certain key capabilities that exist only with ExpressRoute Direct circuits.
You can enable or disable rate limiting for ExpressRoute Direct circuits at the circuit level. For more information, seeRate limiting for ExpressRoute Direct circuits.
Circuit SKUs
ExpressRoute Direct supports large data ingestion scenarios into services such as Azure storage. ExpressRoute circuits  with 100-Gbps ExpressRoute Direct also support40 Gbpsand100 Gbpscircuit bandwidth. The physical port pairs are100 Gbps or 10 Gbpsonly and can have multiple virtual circuits.

Note
You can create logical ExpressRoute circuits on top of your selected ExpressRoute Direct resource of 10-Gbps or 100-Gbps up to the subscribed Bandwidth of 20 Gbps or 200 Gbps. For example, you can create two 10-Gbps ExpressRoute circuits within a single 10-Gbps ExpressRoute Direct resource (port pair).

Note
ExpressRoute Direct doesn't support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) or Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG)
VLAN Tagging
ExpressRoute Direct supports both QinQ and Dot1Q VLAN tagging.
QinQ VLAN Taggingallows for isolated routing domains on a per ExpressRoute circuit basis. Azure dynamically gives an S-Tag at circuit creation that can't be changed. Each peering on the circuit (Private and Microsoft) uses a unique C-Tag as the VLAN. The C-Tag isn't required to be unique across circuits on the ExpressRoute Direct ports.

Dot1Q VLAN Taggingallows for a single tagged VLAN on a per ExpressRoute Direct port pair basis. A C-Tag used on a peering must be unique across all circuits and peerings on the ExpressRoute Direct port pair.
