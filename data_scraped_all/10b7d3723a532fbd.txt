This article provides information on using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1. The SDK v1 is deprecated as of March 31, 2025 and support for it will end on June 30, 2026. You're able to install and use the SDK v1 until that date.
We recommend that you transition to the SDK v2 before June 30, 2026. For more information on the SDK v2, seeWhat is the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2and theSDK v2 reference.
Use pipeline parameters to build flexible pipelines in the designer. Pipeline parameters let you dynamically set values at runtime to encapsulate pipeline logic and reuse assets.
Pipeline parameters are especially useful when resubmitting a pipeline job,retraining models, orperforming batch predictions.
In this article, you learn how to do the following:
Create pipeline parameters
Delete and manage pipeline parameters
Trigger pipeline jobs while adjusting pipeline parameters
Prerequisites
An Azure Machine Learning workspace. SeeCreate workspace resources.

Create pipeline parameter
There are three ways to create a pipeline parameter in the designer:
Create a pipeline parameter in the settings panel, and bind it to a component.
Promote a component parameter to a pipeline parameter.
Promote a dataset to a pipeline parameter
Note
Pipeline parameters only support basic data types likeint,float, andstring.
int
float
string
Option 1: Create a pipeline parameter in the settings panel
In this section, you create a pipeline parameter in the settings panel.
In this example, you create a pipeline parameter that defines how a pipeline fills in missing data using theClean missing datacomponent.
Next to the name of your pipeline draft, select thegear iconto open theSettingspanel.
Next to the name of your pipeline draft, select thegear iconto open theSettingspanel.
In thePipeline parameterssection, select the+icon.
In thePipeline parameterssection, select the+icon.
Enter a name for the parameter and a default value.For example, enterreplace-missing-valueas parameter name and0as default value.
Enter a name for the parameter and a default value.
For example, enterreplace-missing-valueas parameter name and0as default value.
replace-missing-value
0

After you create a pipeline parameter, you mustattach it to the component parameterthat you want to dynamically set.
Option 2: Promote a component parameter
The simplest way to create a pipeline parameter for a component value is to promote a component parameter. Use the following steps to promote a component parameter to a pipeline parameter:
Select the component you want to attach a pipeline parameter to.
Select the component you want to attach a pipeline parameter to.
In the component detail pane, mouseover the parameter you want to specify.
In the component detail pane, mouseover the parameter you want to specify.
Select the ellipses (...) that appear.
Select the ellipses (...) that appear.
SelectAdd to pipeline parameter.
SelectAdd to pipeline parameter.

Enter a parameter name and default value.
Enter a parameter name and default value.
SelectSave
SelectSave
You can now specify new values for this parameter anytime you submit this pipeline.
Option 3: Promote a dataset to a pipeline parameter
If you want to submit your pipeline with variable datasets, you must promote your dataset to a pipeline parameter:
Select the dataset you want to turn into a pipeline parameter.
Select the dataset you want to turn into a pipeline parameter.
In the detail panel of dataset, checkSet as pipeline parameter.
In the detail panel of dataset, checkSet as pipeline parameter.

You can now specify a different dataset by using the pipeline parameter the next time you run the pipeline.
Attach and detach component parameter to pipeline parameter
In this section, you will learn how to attach and detach component parameter to pipeline parameter.
Attach component parameter to pipeline parameter
You can attach the same component parameters of duplicated components to the same pipeline parameter if you want to alter the value at one time when triggering the pipeline job.
The following example has duplicatedClean Missing Datacomponent. For eachClean Missing Datacomponent, attachReplacement valueto pipeline parameterreplace-missing-value:
Select theClean Missing Datacomponent.
Select theClean Missing Datacomponent.
In the component detail pane, to the right of the canvas, set theCleaning modeto "Custom substitution value".
In the component detail pane, to the right of the canvas, set theCleaning modeto "Custom substitution value".
Mouseover theReplacement valuefield.
Mouseover theReplacement valuefield.
Select the ellipses (...) that appear.
Select the ellipses (...) that appear.
Select the pipeline parameterreplace-missing-value.
Select the pipeline parameterreplace-missing-value.
replace-missing-value

You have successfully attached theReplacement valuefield to your pipeline parameter.
Detach component parameter to pipeline parameter
After you attachReplacement valueto pipeline parameter, it is non-actionable.
You can detach component parameter to pipeline parameter by clicking the ellipses (...) next to the component parameter, and selectDetach from pipeline parameter.

Update and delete pipeline parameters
In this section, you learn how to update and delete pipeline parameters.
Update pipeline parameters
Use the following steps to update a component pipeline parameter:
At the top of the canvas, select the gear icon.
In thePipeline parameterssection, you can view and update the name and default value for all of your pipeline parameter.
Delete a dataset pipeline parameter
Use the following steps to delete a dataset pipeline parameter:
Select the dataset component.
Uncheck the optionSet as pipeline parameter.
Delete component pipeline parameters
Use the following steps to delete a component pipeline parameter:
At the top of the canvas, select the gear icon.
At the top of the canvas, select the gear icon.
Select the ellipses (...) next to the pipeline parameter.This view shows you which components the pipeline parameter is attached to.
Select the ellipses (...) next to the pipeline parameter.
This view shows you which components the pipeline parameter is attached to.

SelectDelete parameterto delete the pipeline parameter.NoteDeleting a pipeline parameter will cause all attached component parameters to be detached and the value of detached component parameters will keep current pipeline parameter value.
SelectDelete parameterto delete the pipeline parameter.
Note
Deleting a pipeline parameter will cause all attached component parameters to be detached and the value of detached component parameters will keep current pipeline parameter value.
Trigger a pipeline job with pipeline parameters
In this section, you learn how to submit a pipeline job while setting pipeline parameters.
Resubmit a pipeline job
After submitting a pipeline with pipeline parameters, you can resubmit a pipeline job with different parameters:
Go to pipeline detail page. In thePipeline job overviewwindow, you can check current pipeline parameters and values.
Go to pipeline detail page. In thePipeline job overviewwindow, you can check current pipeline parameters and values.
SelectResubmit.
SelectResubmit.
In theSetup pipeline job, specify your new pipeline parameters.
In theSetup pipeline job, specify your new pipeline parameters.

Use published pipelines
You can also publish a pipeline to use its pipeline parameters. Apublished pipelineis a pipeline that has been deployed to a compute resource, which client applications can invoke via a REST endpoint.
Published endpoints are especially useful for retraining and batch prediction scenarios. For more information, seeHow to retrain models in the designerorRun batch predictions in the designer.
Next steps
In this article, you learned how to create pipeline parameters in the designer. Next, see how you can use pipeline parameters toretrain modelsor performbatch predictions.
You can also learn how touse pipelines programmatically with the SDK v1.
