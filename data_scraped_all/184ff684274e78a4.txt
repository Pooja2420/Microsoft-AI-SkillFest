Overview
TheAzure plannew commerce experience gives you access to Azure services at pay-as-you-go rates for your customers under the Microsoft Customer Agreement.
This plan simplifies the purchase experienceâyou can have multiple Azure subscriptions in an Azure plan. You no longer need to submit a separate order per Azure subscription. This new commerce experience for Azure aligns a single global pricing principle enabling Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners to offer Azure at the published prices.
Transition your customers from their existing CSP Azure offers to Azure services under the Azure plan in the new commerce experience in the CSP program from within Partner Center. This transition requires only that:
The partner and end-customer must have an established reseller relationship through Partner Center
The customer must sign the Microsoft Customer Agreement
Note
Partner confirmation (attestation) of the customer acceptance for the new Microsoft Customer Agreement is required for all other offers, including Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and existing Azure. Partners in the CSP program can't create a new order for the customer without attestation of the Microsoft Customer Agreement. For full details, readConfirm customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement.
