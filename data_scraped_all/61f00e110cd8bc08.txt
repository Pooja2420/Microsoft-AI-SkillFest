To communicate with your Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used. By default, the LDAP traffic isn't encrypted, which is a security concern for many environments.
With Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you can configure the managed domain to use secure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPS). When you use secure LDAP, the traffic is encrypted. Secure LDAP is also known as LDAP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS).
This tutorial shows you how to configure LDAPS for a Domain Services managed domain.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a digital certificate for use with Microsoft Entra Domain Services
Enable secure LDAP for Microsoft Entra Domain Services
Configure secure LDAP for use over the public internet
Bind and test secure LDAP for a managed domain
If you don't have an Azure subscription,create an accountbefore you begin.

Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center
In this tutorial, you configure secure LDAP for the managed domain using the Microsoft Entra admin center. To get started, first sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin center.
Create a certificate for secure LDAP
To use secure LDAP, a digital certificate is used to encrypt the communication. This digital certificate is applied to your managed domain, and lets tools likeLDP.exeuse secure encrypted communication when querying data. There are two ways to create a certificate for secure LDAP access to the managed domain:
A certificate from a public certificate authority (CA) or an enterprise CA.If your organization gets certificates from a public CA, get the secure LDAP certificate from that public CA. If you use an enterprise CA in your organization, get the secure LDAP certificate from the enterprise CA.A public CA only works when you use a custom DNS name with your managed domain. If the DNS domain name of your managed domain ends in.onmicrosoft.com, you can't create a digital certificate to secure the connection with this default domain. Microsoft owns the.onmicrosoft.comdomain, so a public CA won't issue a certificate. In this scenario, create a self-signed certificate and use that to configure secure LDAP.
If your organization gets certificates from a public CA, get the secure LDAP certificate from that public CA. If you use an enterprise CA in your organization, get the secure LDAP certificate from the enterprise CA.
A public CA only works when you use a custom DNS name with your managed domain.

Microsoft owns the.onmicrosoft.comdomain, so a public CA won't issue a certificate. In this scenario, create a self-signed certificate and use that to configure secure LDAP.
A self-signed certificate that you create yourself.This approach is good for testing purposes, and is what this tutorial shows.
This approach is good for testing purposes, and is what this tutorial shows.
The certificate you request or create must meet the following requirements. Your managed domain encounters problems if you enable secure LDAP with an invalid certificate:
Trusted issuer- The certificate must be issued by an authority trusted by computers connecting to the managed domain using secure LDAP. This authority may be a public CA or an Enterprise CA trusted by these computers.
Lifetime- The certificate must be valid for at least the next 3-6 months. Secure LDAP access to your managed domain is disrupted when the certificate expires.
Subject name- The subject name on the certificate must be your managed domain. For example, if your domain is namedaaddscontoso.com, the certificate's subject name must be *.aaddscontoso.com.The DNS name or subject alternate name of the certificate must be a wildcard certificate to ensure the secure LDAP works properly with Domain Services. Domain Controllers use random names and can be removed or added to ensure the service remains available.

Key usage- The certificate must be configured fordigital signaturesandkey encipherment.
Certificate purpose- The certificate must be valid for TLS server authentication.
There are several tools available to create self-signed certificate such as OpenSSL, Keytool, MakeCert,New-SelfSignedCertificatecmdlet, and so on.
In this tutorial, let's create a self-signed certificate for secure LDAP using theNew-SelfSignedCertificatecmdlet.
Open a PowerShell window asAdministratorand run the following commands. Replace the$dnsNamevariable with the DNS name used by your own managed domain, such asaaddscontoso.com:
# Define your own DNS name used by your managed domain
$dnsName="aaddscontoso.com"

# Get the current date to set a one-year expiration
$lifetime=Get-Date

# Create a self-signed certificate for use with Azure AD DS
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject *.$dnsName `
  -NotAfter $lifetime.AddDays(365) -KeyUsage DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment `
  -Type SSLServerAuthentication -DnsName *.$dnsName, $dnsName
# Define your own DNS name used by your managed domain
$dnsName="aaddscontoso.com"

# Get the current date to set a one-year expiration
$lifetime=Get-Date

# Create a self-signed certificate for use with Azure AD DS
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject *.$dnsName `
  -NotAfter $lifetime.AddDays(365) -KeyUsage DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment `
  -Type SSLServerAuthentication -DnsName *.$dnsName, $dnsName
The following example output shows that the certificate was successfully generated and is stored in the local certificate store (LocalMachine\MY):
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject *.$dnsName `
>>   -NotAfter $lifetime.AddDays(365) -KeyUsage DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment `
>>   -Type SSLServerAuthentication -DnsName *.$dnsName, $dnsName.com

   PSParentPath: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\MY

Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------

Understand and export required certificates
To use secure LDAP, the network traffic is encrypted using public key infrastructure (PKI).
Aprivatekey is applied to the managed domain.This private key is used todecryptthe secure LDAP traffic. The private key should only be applied to the managed domain and not widely distributed to client computers.A certificate that includes the private key uses the.PFXfile format.When exporting the certificate, you must specify theTripleDES-SHA1encryption algorithm. This is applicable to the .pfx file only and does not impact the algorithm used by the certificate itself. Note that theTripleDES-SHA1option is available only beginning with Windows Server 2016.

Certificates without the private key use the.CERfile format.
These two keys, theprivateandpublickeys, make sure that only the appropriate computers can successfully communicate with each other. If you use a public CA or enterprise CA, you are issued with a certificate that includes the private key and can be applied to a managed domain. The public key should already be known and trusted by client computers.
In this tutorial, you created a self-signed certificate with the private key, so you need to export the appropriate private and public components.

Export a certificate for client computers
Client computers must trust the issuer of the secure LDAP certificate to be able to connect successfully to the managed domain using LDAPS. The client computers need a certificate to successfully encrypt data that is decrypted by Domain Services. If you use a public CA, the computer should automatically trust these certificate issuers and have a corresponding certificate.
In this tutorial you use a self-signed certificate, and generated a certificate that includes the private key in the previous step. Now let's export and then install the self-signed certificate into the trusted certificate store on the client computer:

A notification is displayed that secure LDAP is being configured for the managed domain. You can't modify other settings for the managed domain until this operation is complete.
It takes a few minutes to enable secure LDAP for your managed domain. If the secure LDAP certificate you provide doesn't match the required criteria, the action to enable secure LDAP for the managed domain fails.
Some common reasons for failure are if the domain name is incorrect, the encryption algorithm for the certificate isn'tTripleDES-SHA1, or the certificate expires soon or has already expired. You can re-create the certificate with valid parameters, then enable secure LDAP using this updated certificate.
Change an expiring certificate
Create a replacement secure LDAP certificate by following the steps tocreate a certificate for secure LDAP.
To apply the replacement certificate to Domain Services, in the left menu forMicrosoft Entra Domain Servicesin the Microsoft Entra admin center, selectSecure LDAP, and then selectChange Certificate.
Distribute the certificate to any clients that connect by using secure LDAP.
Lock down secure LDAP access over the internet
When you enable secure LDAP access over the internet to your managed domain, it creates a security threat. The managed domain is reachable from the internet on TCP port 636. It's recommended to restrict access to the managed domain to specific known IP addresses for your environment. An Azure network security group rule can be used to limit access to secure LDAP.
Let's create a rule to allow inbound secure LDAP access over TCP port 636 from a specified set of IP addresses. A defaultDenyAllrule with a lower priority applies to all other inbound traffic from the internet, so only the specified addresses can reach your managed domain using secure LDAP.
In theMicrosoft Entra admin center, search for and selectResource groups.

Configure DNS zone for external access
With secure LDAP access enabled over the internet, update the DNS zone so that client computers can find this managed domain. TheSecure LDAP external IP addressis listed on thePropertiestab for your managed domain:

Configure your external DNS provider to create a host record, such asldaps, to resolve to this external IP address. To test locally on your machine first, you can create an entry in the Windows hosts file. To successfully edit the hosts file on your local machine, openNotepadas an administrator, then open the fileC:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
The following example DNS entry, either with your external DNS provider or in the local hosts file, resolves traffic forldaps.aaddscontoso.comto the external IP address of168.62.205.103:
ldaps.aaddscontoso.com
168.62.205.103
168.62.205.103    ldaps.aaddscontoso.com
168.62.205.103    ldaps.aaddscontoso.com
Test queries to the managed domain
To connect and bind to your managed domain and search over LDAP, you use theLDP.exetool. This tool is included in the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) package. For more information, seeinstall Remote Server Administration Tools.
OpenLDP.exeand connect to the managed domain. SelectConnection, then chooseConnect....
Enter the secure LDAP DNS domain name of your managed domain created in the previous step, such asldaps.aaddscontoso.com. To use secure LDAP, setPortto636, then check the box forSSL.
SelectOKto connect to the managed domain.
Next, bind to your managed domain. Users (and service accounts) can't perform LDAP simple binds if you have disabled NTLM password hash synchronization on your managed domain. For more information on disabling NTLM password hash synchronization, seeSecure your managed domain.
Select theConnectionmenu option, then chooseBind....
Provide the credentials of a user account that belongs to the managed domain. Enter the user account's password, then enter your domain, such asaaddscontoso.com.
ForBind type, choose the option forBind with credentials.
SelectOKto bind to your managed domain.
To see of the objects stored in your managed domain:

Note
If a Self signed certificate is used, make sure Self signed certificate added on the Trusted Root Certification Authorities for LDAPS to work with LDP.exe
Clean up resources
If you added a DNS entry to the local hosts file of your computer to test connectivity for this tutorial, remove this entry and add a formal record in your DNS zone. To remove the entry from the local hosts file, complete the following steps:
On your local machine, openNotepadas an administrator
Browse to and open the fileC:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Delete the line for the record you added, such as168.62.205.103    ldaps.aaddscontoso.com
168.62.205.103    ldaps.aaddscontoso.com
Troubleshooting
If you see an error stating that LDAP.exe cannot connect, try working through the different aspects of getting the connection:
Configuring the domain controller
Configuring the client
Networking
Establishing the TLS session
For the certificate subject name match, the DC will use the Domain Services domain name (not the Microsoft Entra domain name) to search its certificate store for the certificate. Spelling mistakes, for example, prevent the DC from selecting the right certificate.
The client attempts to establish the TLS connection using the name you provided. The traffic needs to get all the way through. The DC sends the public key of the server auth cert. The cert needs to have the right usage in the certificate, the name signed in the subject name must be compatible for the client to trust that the server is the DNS name which youâre connecting to (that is, a wildcard will work, with no spelling mistakes), and the client must trust the issuer. You can check for any problems in that chain in the System log in Event Viewer, and filter the events where source equals Schannel. Once those pieces are in place, they form a session key.
For more information, seeTLS Handshake.
