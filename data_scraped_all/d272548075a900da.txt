Afullouterjoin combines the effect of applying both left and right outer-joins. For columns of the table that lack a matching row, the result set containsnullvalues. For those records that do match, a single row is produced in the result set containing fields populated from both tables.

Tip
For best performance, if one table is always smaller than the other, use it as the left side of the join.

Returns
Schema: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys.Rows: All records from both tables with unmatched cells populated with null.
Example
This example query combines rows from both tables X and Y, filling in missing values with NULL where there's no match in the other table. This allows you to see all possible combinations of keys from both tables.
Run the query
let X = datatable(Key:string, Value1:long)
[
    'a',1,
    'b',2,
    'b',3,
    'c',4
];
let Y = datatable(Key:string, Value2:long)
[
    'b',10,
    'c',20,
    'c',30,
    'd',40
];
X | join kind=fullouter Y on Key
let X = datatable(Key:string, Value1:long)
[
    'a',1,
    'b',2,
    'b',3,
    'c',4
];
let Y = datatable(Key:string, Value2:long)
[
    'b',10,
    'c',20,
    'c',30,
    'd',40
];
X | join kind=fullouter Y on Key
