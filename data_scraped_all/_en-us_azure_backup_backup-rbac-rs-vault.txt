Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using Azure RBAC, you can segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs.
Important
Roles provided by Azure Backup are limited to actions that can be performed in Azure portal or via REST API or Recovery Services vault PowerShell or CLI cmdlets. Actions performed in the Azure Backup agent client UI or System center Data Protection Manager UI or Azure Backup Server UI are out of control of these roles.
Azure Backup provides three built-in roles to control backup management operations. Learn more onAzure built-in roles
Backup Contributor- This role has all permissions to create and manage backup except deleting Recovery Services vault and giving access to others. Imagine this role as admin of backup management who can do every backup management operation.
Backup Operator- This role has permissions to everything a contributor does except removing backup and managing backup policies. This role is equivalent to contributor except it can't perform destructive operations such as stop backup with delete data or remove registration of on-premises resources.
Backup Reader- This role has permissions to view all backup management operations. Imagine this role to be a monitoring person.
If you're looking to define your own roles for even more control, see how tobuild Custom rolesin Azure RBAC.
Mapping Backup built-in roles to backup management actions
Minimum role requirements for Azure VM backup
The following table captures the Backup management actions and corresponding minimum Azure role required to perform that operation.

Important
If you specify VM Contributor at a VM resource scope and selectBackupas part of VM settings, it will open theEnable Backupscreen, even though the VM is already backed up. This is because the call to verify backup status works only at the subscription level. To avoid this, either go to the vault and open the backup item view of the VM or specify the VM Contributor role at a subscription level.
Minimum role requirements for Azure workload backups (SQL and HANA DB backups)
The following table captures the Backup management actions and corresponding minimum Azure role required to perform that operation.
Minimum role requirements for the Azure File share backup
The following table captures the Backup management actions and corresponding Azure role required to perform that operation.
Note
If you've contributor access at the resource group level and want to configure backup from file share blade, ensure to getmicrosoft.recoveryservices/Locations/backupStatus/actionpermission at the subscription level. To do so, create acustom roleand assign this permission.
