The Live Data feature in Container insights gives you direct access to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container logs (stdout/stderror), events, and pod metrics. It exposes direct access tokubectl logs -c,kubectl getevents, andkubectl top pods. A console pane shows the logs, events, and metrics generated by the container engine to help with troubleshooting issues in real time.
kubectl logs -c
kubectl get
kubectl top pods
Note
AKS usesKubernetes cluster-level logging architectures. The container logs are located inside/var/log/containerson the node. To access a node, seeConnect to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes.
/var/log/containers
This article provides an overview of this feature and helps you understand how to use it.
For help with setting up or troubleshooting the Live Data feature, see theSetup guide. This feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, seeThe Kubernetes API.
View AKS resource live logs
Note
You must be on a machine on the same private network to access live logs from a private cluster.
To view the live logs for pods, deployments, replica sets, stateful sets, daemon sets, jobs, or cron jobs with or without Container insights from the AKS resource view:
In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
From the service menu, underKubernetes resources, selectWorkloads.
Select a pod, deployment, replica set, stateful set, daemon set, or job from the respective tab.
From the overview pane, selectLive Logs, and then select a pod to start collecting the live data.
View events
You can view real-time event data as it's generated by the container engine when you select a container, pod, node, replica set, stateful set, daemon set, job, cron job, or deployment. To view events:
In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
From the service menu, underMonitoring, selectInsights.
From the service menu, underMonitoring, selectInsights.
Select an object from the performance grid from the respective tab.
Select an object from the performance grid from the respective tab.
From the overview pane, selectLive Events. If the AKS cluster is configured with single sign-on by using Microsoft Entra ID, you're prompted to authenticate on first use during that browser session. Select your account and finish authentication with Azure.

Note
To view the data from your Log Analytics workspace, selectView in Log Analytics. The log search results potentially showNodes,Daemon Sets,Replica Sets,Stateful Sets,Jobs,Cron Jobs,Pods, andContainers. These logs might no longer exist. The log search results forStateful Setsshows the data for the pods in a stateful set. Attempting to search logs for a container that isn't available inkubectlwill also fail here. To learn more about viewing historical logs, events, and metrics, seeHow to query logs from Container insights.
kubectl
Filter events
While you view events, you can also limit the results using the pill below the search bar. Depending on the resource you select, the pill lists a node, pod, namespace, or cluster to choose from.
View metrics
You can view real-time metric data as it's generated by the container engine from theNodesorControllersview only when aPodis selected. To view metrics:
In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.

Use live data views
The following sections describe functionality that you can use in the different live data views.
Search
The Live Data feature includes search functionality. In theSearchbox, you can filter results by entering a keyword or term. Any matching results are highlighted to allow quick review. While you view the events, you can also limit the results using theFilterfeature below the search bar. Depending on what resource you've selected, you can choose from a node, pod, namespace, or cluster.
Scroll, lock, and pause
To suspend autoscroll and control the behavior of the tab so that you can manually scroll through the new data read, select theScrolloption. To reenable autoscroll, selectScrollagain. You can also pause retrieval of log or event data by selecting thePauseoption. When you're ready to resume, selectPlay.
Suspend or pause autoscroll for only a short period of time while you're troubleshooting an issue. These requests might affect the availability and throttling of the Kubernetes API on your cluster.
Important
No data is stored permanently during the operation of this feature. All information captured during the session is deleted when you close your browser or navigate away from it. Data only remains present for visualization inside the five-minute window of the metrics feature. Any metrics older than five minutes are also deleted. The Live Data buffer queries within reasonable memory usage limits.
Frequently asked questions
This section provides answers to common questions.
What does "Other processes" represent under the Node view?
Other processesare intended to help you clearly understand the root cause of the high resource usage on your node. This information helps you to distinguish usage between containerized processes versus noncontainerized processes.
What are these other processes?
They're noncontainerized processes that run on your node.
How do we calculate this?
Other processes=Total usage from CAdvisor-Usage from containerized process
The other processes include:
Self-managed or managed Kubernetes noncontainerized processes.
Container run-time processes.
Kubelet.
System processes running on your node.
Other non-Kubernetes workloads running on node hardware or a VM.
