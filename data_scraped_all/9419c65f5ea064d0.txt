Important
Starting 1st April 2025, all jobs running on agent-based Hybrid Worker will be stopped.
Azure Automation Agent-based User Hybrid Runbook Worker (Windows and Linux) has retired on31 August 2024and is no longer supported. Follow the guidelines on how tomigrate from an existing Agent-based User Hybrid Runbook Workers to Extension-based Hybrid Workers.
You can use the user Hybrid Runbook Worker feature of Azure Automation to run runbooks directly on an Azure or non-Azure machine, including servers registered withAzure Arc-enabled servers. From the machine or server that's hosting the role, you can run runbooks directly against it and against resources in the environment to manage those local resources.
Azure Automation stores and manages runbooks and then delivers them to one or more chosen machines. This article describes how to deploy a user Hybrid Runbook Worker on a Windows machine, how to remove the worker, and how to remove a Hybrid Runbook Worker group. For user Hybrid Runbook Workers, see alsoDeploy an extension-based Windows or Linux user Hybrid Runbook Worker in Automation
After you successfully deploy a runbook worker, reviewRun runbooks on a Hybrid Runbook Workerto learn how to configure your runbooks to automate processes in your on-premises datacenter or other cloud environment.
Note
A hybrid worker can co-exist with both platforms:Agent based (V1)andExtension based (V2). If you install Extension based (V2)on a hybrid worker already running Agent based (V1), then you would see two entries of the Hybrid Runbook Worker in the group. One with Platform Extension based (V2) and the other Agent based (V1).Learn more.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure that you have the following.
A Log Analytics workspace
The Hybrid Runbook Worker role depends on an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace to install and configure the role. You can create it throughAzure Resource Manager, throughPowerShell, or in theAzure portal.
If you don't have an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace, review theAzure Monitor Log design guidancebefore you create the workspace.
Log Analytics agent
The Hybrid Runbook Worker role requires theLog Analytics agentfor the supported Windows operating system. For servers or machines hosted outside of Azure, you can install the Log Analytics agent usingAzure Arc-enabled servers.
Supported Windows operating system
The Hybrid Runbook Worker feature supports the following operating systems:
Windows Server 2022 (including Server Core)
Windows Server 2019 (including Server Core)
Windows Server 2016, version 1709 and 1803 (excluding Server Core)
Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2
Windows Server 2008 SP2 (x64), 2008 R2
Windows 10 Enterprise (including multi-session) and Pro
Windows 8 Enterprise and Pro
Windows 7 SP1
Note
Hybrid Worker would follow support timelines of the OS vendor.
Minimum requirements
The minimum requirements for a Windows system and user Hybrid Runbook Worker are:
Windows PowerShell 5.1 (download WMF 5.1). PowerShell Core isn't supported.
.NET Framework 4.6.2 or later
Two cores
4 GB of RAM
Port 443 (outbound)
Network configuration
For networking requirements for the Hybrid Runbook Worker, seeConfiguring your network.
Adding a machine to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group
You can add the worker machine to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group in one of your Automation accounts. For machines hosting the system Hybrid Runbook worker managed by Update Management, they can be added to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group. But you must use the same Automation account for both Update Management and the Hybrid Runbook Worker group membership.
Note
Azure AutomationUpdate Managementautomatically installs the system Hybrid Runbook Worker on an Azure or non-Azure machine that's enabled for Update Management. However, this worker is not registered with any Hybrid Runbook Worker groups in your Automation account. To run your runbooks on those machines, you need to add them to a Hybrid Runbook Worker group. Follow step 6 under the sectionManual deploymentto add it to a group.
Enable for management with Azure Automation State Configuration
For information about enabling machines for management with Azure Automation State Configuration, seeEnable machines for management by Azure Automation State Configuration.
Note
To manage the configuration of machines that support the Hybrid Runbook Worker role with Desired State Configuration (DSC), you must add the machines as DSC nodes.
Installation options
To install and configure a Windows user Hybrid Runbook Worker, you can use one of the following methods.
Use a provided PowerShell script to completelyautomatethe process of configuring one or more Windows machines. This is the recommended method for machines in your datacenter or another cloud environment.
Manually import the Automation solution, install the Log Analytics agent for Windows, and configure the worker role on the machine.
Agent-based hybrid worker uses MMA proxy setting. You have to pass the proxy setting while installing the log analytics extension(MMA) and this setting will be stored under MMA configuration(registry) on VM.
Automated deployment
There are two methods to automatically deploy a Hybrid Runbook Worker. You can import a runbook from the Runbook Gallery in the Azure portal and run it, or you can manually download a script from the PowerShell Gallery.
Importing a runbook from the Runbook Gallery
The import procedure is described in detail inImport runbooks from GitHub with the Azure portal. The name of the runbook to import isCreate Automation Windows HybridWorker.
The runbook uses the following parameters.

Install PowerShell modules
Runbooks can use any of the activities and cmdlets defined in the modules installed in your Azure Automation environment. As these modules aren't automatically deployed to on-premises machines, you must install them manually. The exception is the Azure module. This module is installed by default and provides access to cmdlets for all Azure services and activities for Azure Automation.
Because the primary purpose of the Hybrid Runbook Worker is to manage local resources, you most likely need to install the modules that support these resources, particularly thePowerShellGetmodule. For information on installing Windows PowerShell modules, seeWindows PowerShell.
PowerShellGet
Modules that are installed must be in a location referenced by thePSModulePathenvironment variable so that the hybrid worker can automatically import them. For more information, seeInstall Modules in PSModulePath.

You can create custom Azure Automation roles and grant following permissions to Hybrid Worker Groups and Hybrid Workers. To learn more about how to create Azure Automation custom roles, seeAzure custom roles
Check version of Hybrid Worker
To check version of agent-based Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker, go to the following path:
C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\AzureAutomation\
C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\AzureAutomation\
TheAzure Automationfolder has a sub-folder with the version number as the name of the sub-folder.
Update Log Analytics agent to latest version
Azure AutomationAgent-based User Hybrid Runbook Worker(V1) requires theLog Analytics agent(also known as MMA agent) during the installation of the Hybrid Worker. We recommend you to update the Log Analytics agent to the latest version to reduce security vulnerabilities and benefit from bug fixes.
Log Analytics agent versions prior to10.20.18053 (bundle) and 1.0.18053.0 (extension)use an older method of certificate handling, and hence it isnot recommended. Hybrid Workers on the outdated agents will not be able to connect to Azure, and Azure Automation jobs executed by these Hybrid Workers will stop.
You must update the Log Analytics agent to the latest version by following the below steps:
Check the current version of the Log Analytics agent for your Windows Hybrid Worker:  Go to the installation path -C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agentand right-clickHealthService.exeto checkProperties. The fieldProduct versionprovides the version number of the Log Analytics agent.
If your Log Analytics agent version is prior to10.20.18053 (bundle) and 1.0.18053.0 (extension), upgrade to the latest version of the Windows Log Analytics agent, following theseguidelines.
Note
Any Azure Automation jobs running on the Hybrid Worker during the upgrade process might stop. Ensure that there arenât any jobs running or scheduled during the Log Analytics agent upgrade.
