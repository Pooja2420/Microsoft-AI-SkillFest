On September 30, 2025, Basic Load Balancer will be retired. For more information, see theofficial announcement. If you are currently using Basic Load Balancer, make sure to upgrade to Standard Load Balancer prior to the retirement date. For guidance on upgrading, visitUpgrading from Basic Load Balancer - Guidance.
Load balancingrefers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets (VMSS).
Azure Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's the single point of contact for clients. The service distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's frontend to backend pool instances. These flows are distributed according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets.
Apublic load balancercan provide both inbound and outbound connectivity for the VMs inside your virtual network. For inbound traffic scenarios, Azure Load Balancer can load balance internet traffic to your VMs. For outbound traffic scenarios, the service can translate the VMs' private IP addresses to public IP addresses for any outbound connections that originate from your VMs.
Alternatively, aninternal (or private) load balancercan provide inbound connectivity to your VMs in private network connectivity scenarios, such as accessing a load balancer frontend from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic inside a virtual network.

For more information on the service's individual components, seeAzure Load Balancer components.
Azure Load Balancer has three stock-keeping units (SKUs) - Basic, Standard, and Gateway. Each SKU is catered towards a specific scenario and has differences in scale, features, and pricing. For more information, seeAzure Load Balancer SKUs.
Why use Azure Load Balancer?
With Azure Load Balancer, you can scale your applications and create highly available services.
The service supports both inbound and outbound scenarios. It provides low latency and high throughput, and it scales up to millions of flows for all TCP and UDP applications.
Key scenarios that you can accomplish by using Azure Standard Load Balancer include:

Standard load balancers and standard public IP addresses are closed to inbound connections, unless network security groups (NSGs) open them. You use NSGs to explicitly permit allowed traffic. If you don't have an NSG on a subnet or network interface card (NIC) of your virtual machine resource, traffic is not allowed to reach the resource. To learn about NSGs and how to apply them to your scenario, seeNetwork security groups.
