APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
This tutorial shows how to import an OpenAPI specification backend API in JSON format into Azure API Management. For this example, you import the open sourcePetstore API.
Tip
API teams can use this feature inworkspaces. Workspaces provide isolated administrative access to APIs and their own API runtime environments.
Once you import the backend API into API Management, your API Management API becomes a faÃ§ade for the backend API. You can customize the faÃ§ade to your needs in API Management without touching the backend API. For more information, seeTransform and protect your API.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Import an API into API Management
Test the API in the Azure portal
After import, you can manage the API in the Azure portal.

Prerequisites
UnderstandAzure API Management terminology.
Create an Azure API Management instance.
Go to your API Management instance
In the Azureportal, search for and selectAPI Management services:

Enter the values from the following table.You can set API values during creation or later by going to theSettingstab.SettingValueDescriptionOpenAPI specificationhttps://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.jsonSpecifies the backend service implementing the API and the operations that the API supports.The backend service URL appears later as theWeb service URLon the API'sSettingspage.After import, you can add, edit, rename, or delete operations in the specification.Include query parameters in operation templatesSelected (default)Specifies whether to import required query parameters in the specification as template parameters in API Management.Display nameAfter you enter the OpenAPI specification URL, API Management fills out this field based on the JSON.The name displayed in thedeveloper portal.NameAfter you enter the OpenAPI specification URL, API Management fills out this field based on the JSON.A unique name for the API.DescriptionAfter you enter the OpenAPI specification URL, API Management fills out this field based on the JSON.An optional description of the API.URL schemeHTTPSWhich protocols can access the API.API URL suffixpetstoreThe suffix appended to the base URL for the API Management service. API Management distinguishes APIs by their suffix, so the suffix must be unique for every API for a given publisher.TagsTags for organizing APIs for searching, grouping, or filtering.ProductsUnlimitedAssociation of one or more APIs. In certain tiers, API Management instance comes with two sample products:StarterandUnlimited. You publish an API in the developer portal by associating the API with a product.You can include several APIs in a product and offer productsubscriptionsto developers through the developer portal. To add this API to another product, type or select the product name. Repeat this step to add the API to multiple products. You can also add APIs to products later from theSettingspage.For more information about products, seeCreate and publish a product.GatewaysManagedAPI gateway(s) that expose the API. This field is available only inDeveloperandPremiumtier services.Managedindicates the gateway built into the API Management service and hosted by Microsoft in Azure.Self-hosted gatewaysare available only in the Premium and Developer service tiers. You can deploy them on-premises or in other clouds.If no gateways are selected, the API won't be available and your API requests won't succeed.Version this API?Select or deselectFor more information, seePublish multiple versions of your API.
Enter the values from the following table.
You can set API values during creation or later by going to theSettingstab.

SelectCreateto create your API.
SelectCreateto create your API.
If you have problems importing an API definition, see thelist of known issues and restrictions.
Test the new API in the Azure portal
You can call API operations directly from the Azure portal, which provides a convenient way to view and test the operations. In the portal's test console, by default, APIs are called by using a key from the built-in all-access subscription. You can also test API calls by using a subscription key scoped to a product.
In the left navigation of your API Management instance, selectAPIs>Swagger Petstore.
In the left navigation of your API Management instance, selectAPIs>Swagger Petstore.
Select theTesttab, and then selectFinds Pets by status. The page shows thestatusQuery parameter. Select one of the available values, such aspending. You can also add query parameters and headers here.In theHTTP requestsection, theOcp-Apim-Subscription-Keyheader is filled in automatically for you, which you can see if you select the "eye" icon.
