Scan
Authentication for a scan
In order to have access to scan the data source, an authentication method in the Azure Cosmos DB database Storage account needs to be configured.
There is only one way to set up authentication for Azure Cosmos DB Database:
Account Key- Secrets can be created inside an Azure Key Vault to store credentials in order to enable access for Microsoft Purview to scan data sources securely using the secrets. A secret can be a storage account key, SQL login password or a password.
Note
You need to deploy anAzure key vaultresource in your subscription and assignMicrosoft Purview accountâsMSI with required access permission to secrets insideAzure key vault.
You need to get your access key and store in the key vault:
Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB database storage account
