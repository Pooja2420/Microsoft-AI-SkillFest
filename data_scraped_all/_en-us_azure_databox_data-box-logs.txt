A Data Box import order goes through the following steps:
Order
Set up,
Data copy
Return
Upload to Azure and verify, and
Data erasure
For each step in the order, you can undertake multiple actions to control access and track the order, audit the events, and interpret the various logs that are generated.
The following table provides a summary of each step undertaken when processing an import order. The table also identifies the tools available to track and audit the order during each step.
Azure portal
Shipping carrier website
Email notifications
This article describes in detail the various mechanisms or tools available to track and audit Data Box import orders. The information in this article applies to Azure Data 120, Data Box 525, and Data Box orders. In the subsequent sections, any references to Data Box apply to all SKUs.
Note
If firewall rules are set on the storage account for your Data Box, you might not be able to access copy logs from the Azure portal by usingCOPY LOG PATHon theOverviewpane. To access the logs, either modify the storage firewall settings to allow the current system, or use a system which is in the firewall network.
Set up access control on the order
You can control who can access your order when the order is first created. Set up Azure roles at various scopes to control the access to the Data Box order. An Azure role determines the type of access â read-write, read-only, read-write to a subset of operations.
The two roles that can be defined for the Azure Data Box service are:
Data Box Reader- have read-only access to an order(s) as defined by the scope. They can only view details of an order. They canât access any other details related to storage accounts or edit the order details such as address and so on.
Data Box Contributor- can only create an order to transfer data to a given storage accountif they already have write access to a storage account. If they do not have access to a storage account, they can't even create a Data Box order to copy data to the account. This role does not define any Storage account related permissions nor grants access to storage accounts.
To restrict access to an order, you can:
Assign a role at an order level. The user only has those permissions as defined by the roles to interact with that specific Data Box order only and nothing else.
Assign a role at the resource group level, the user has access to all the Data Box orders within a resource group.
For more information on suggested Azure RBAC use, seeBest practices for Azure RBAC.
Track the order
You can track your order through the Azure portal and through the shipping carrier website. The following mechanisms are in place to track the Data Box order at any time:
To track the order when the device is in Azure datacenter or your premises, go to yourData Box order > Overviewin Azure portal.
To track the order when the device is in Azure datacenter or your premises, go to yourData Box order > Overviewin Azure portal.

To track the order while the device is in transit, go to the regional carrier website, for example, UPS  website in US. Provide the tracking number associated with your order.

Data Box also sends email notifications anytime the order status changes based on the emails provided when the order was created. For a list of all the Data Box order statuses, seeView order status. To change the notification settings associated with the order, seeEdit notification details.

Query activity logs during setup
Your Data Box arrives on your premises in a locked state. You can use the device credentials available in the Azure portal for your order.When a Data Box is set up, you may need to know who all accessed the device credentials. To figure out who accessed theDevice credentialsblade, you can query the Activity logs.  Any action that involves accessingDevice details > Credentialsblade is logged into the activity logs asListCredentialsaction.

ListCredentials

Each sign into the Data Box is logged real time. However, this information is only available in theAudit logsafter the order is successfully completed.

View error log during data copy
During the data copy to Data Box, an error file is generated if there are any issues with the data being copied.
Error.xml file
Make sure that the copy jobs have finished with no errors. If there are errors during the copy process, download the logs from theConnect and copypage.
If you copied a file that is not 512 bytes aligned to a managed disk folder on your Data Box, the file isn't uploaded as a page blob to your staging storage account. You will see an error in the logs. Remove the file, and copy a file that is 512 bytes aligned.
If you copied a VHDX, or a dynamic VHD, or a differencing VHD, you will see an error in the logs. Those file types are not supported.
The following is a sample of anerror.xmlfile containing different errors when copying to managed disks.

In each of the preceding cases, you need to resolve the errors before you proceed to the next step. For more information on the errors received during data copy to Data Box via SMB or NFS protocols, go toTroubleshoot Data Box. For information on errors received during data copy to Data Box via REST, go toTroubleshoot Data Box Blob storage issues.
Inspect BOM during prepare to ship
During prepare to ship, a list of files known as the Bill of Materials (BOM) or manifest file is created.
Use this file to verify against the actual names and the number of files that were copied to the Data Box.
Use this file to verify against the actual sizes of the files.
Verify that thecrc64corresponds to a non-zero string.
For more information on the errors received during prepare to ship, go toTroubleshoot Data Box and Data Box Heavy issues.
BOM or manifest file
The BOM or manifest file contains the list of all the files that are copied to the Data Box device. The BOM file has file names and file sizes, and the checksum. A separate BOM file is created for the block blobs, page blobs, Azure Files, for copy via the REST APIs, and for the copy to managed disks on the Data Box. You can download the BOM files from the local web UI of the device during the prepare to ship.
These files also reside on the Data Box device and are uploaded to the associated storage account in the Azure datacenter.
BOM file format
BOM or manifest file has the following general format:
<file size = "file-size-in-bytes" crc64="cyclic-redundancy-check-string">\folder-path-on-data-box\name-of-file-copied.md</file>
<file size = "file-size-in-bytes" crc64="cyclic-redundancy-check-string">\folder-path-on-data-box\name-of-file-copied.md</file>
The following is a sample of a manifest generated when data is copied to the block blob share on the Data Box.

The BOM or manifest files are also copied to the Azure storage account. You can use the BOM or manifest files to verify that files uploaded to the Azure match the data that was copied to the Data Box.
Review copy log during upload to Azure
During the data upload to Azure, a copy log is created.
Copy log
For each order that is processed, the Data Box service creates a copy log in the associated storage account. The copy log has the total number of files that were uploaded and the number of files that errored out during the data copy from Data Box to your Azure storage account.
Note
A Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) computation is completed during the upload to Azure. The CRCs from the data copy and data upload are compared. A CRC mismatch indicates that the corresponding files failed to upload.
You can use the CRC checksum tool script to compare the checksums of the on-premises source data with the data uploaded to Azure. The script can be downloaded fromAzure Samples. See theREADME filefor more information.
By default, logs are written to a container namedcopylog. The logs are stored with the following naming convention:
copylog
storage-account-name/databoxcopylog/ordername_device-serial-number_CopyLog_guid.xml.
storage-account-name/databoxcopylog/ordername_device-serial-number_CopyLog_guid.xml
The copy log path is also displayed on theOverviewblade for the portal.

Note
If firewall rules are set on the storage account for your Data Box, you might not be able to access copy logs from the Azure portal by usingCOPY LOG PATHon theOverviewpane. To access the logs, either modify the storage firewall settings to allow the current system, or use a system which is in the firewall network.
Upload completed successfully
The following sample describes the general format of a copy log for a Data Box upload that completed successfully:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
-<CopyLog Summary="Summary">
<Status>Succeeded</Status>
<TotalFiles>45</TotalFiles>
<FilesErrored>0</FilesErrored>
</CopyLog>
<?xml version="1.0"?>
-<CopyLog Summary="Summary">
<Status>Succeeded</Status>
<TotalFiles>45</TotalFiles>
<FilesErrored>0</FilesErrored>
</CopyLog>
Upload completed with warnings
Upload to Azure completes with warnings if your data had container, blob, or file names that didn't conform to Azure naming conventions and the names were modified in order to upload the data to Azure.

Here is an example of a copy log where the containers that didn't conform to Azure naming conventions were renamed during the data upload to Azure.
The unique names for the new containers are in the formatDataBox-GUID. The data from the original containers is put in the new, renamed containers. The copy log specifies the old and new container names.
DataBox-GUID
<ErroredEntity Path="New Folder">

Here is an example of a copy log in which blobs or files that didn't conform to Azure naming conventions were renamed during the data upload to Azure. The new blob or file names are converted to SHA256 digest of relative path to container and are uploaded to the path based on the destination type. The destination can be block blobs, page blobs, or Azure Files.
Thecopylogspecifies the old and the new blob or file name and the path in Azure.

Upload completed with errors
Upload to Azure may also complete with errors.

You may occasionally get a non-retryable error that causes a file not to upload. In that case, you'll receive a notification. For information about how to follow up on the notification, seeReview copy errors in data uploads from Azure Data Box.
The following is an example of a copy log where the upload completed with errors:

Get chain of custody logs after data erasure
After the data is erased from the Data Box disks as per the NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines, the chain of custody logs are available. These logs include the audit logs and the order history. The BOM or manifest files are also copied with the audit logs.
Audit logs
Audit logs contain information on how to power on and access shares on the Data Box when it is outside of Azure datacenter. These logs are located at:storage-account/azuredatabox-chainofcustodylogs
storage-account/azuredatabox-chainofcustodylogs
The following is a sample of the audit log from a Data Box:
