This article describes the different ways that Azure Monitor charges for usage and how to evaluate charges on your Azure bill.
Tip
For strategies to reduce your Azure Monitor costs, seeCost optimization and Azure Monitor.
Pricing model
Azure Monitor uses a consumption-based pricing (pay-as-you-go) billing model where you only pay for what you use. Features of Azure Monitor that are enabled by default don't incur any charge. This includes collection and alerting on theActivity logand collection and analysis ofplatform metrics.
Several other features don't have a direct cost, but you instead pay for the ingestion and retention of data that they collect. The following table describes the different types of usage that are charged in Azure Monitor. Detailed current pricing for each is provided inAzure Monitor pricing.
A list of Azure Monitor billing meter names is availablehere.
Data transfer charges
Sending data to Azure Monitor can incur data bandwidth charges. As described in theAzure Bandwidth pricing page, data transfer between Azure services located in two regions charged as outbound data transfer at the normal rate. Inbound data transfer is free. Data transfer charges for Azure Monitor though are typically small compared to the costs for data ingestion and retention. You should focus more on your ingested data volume to control your costs.
Note
Data sent to a different region usingDiagnostic Settingsdoesn't incur data transfer charges.
View Azure Monitor usage and charges
There are two primary tools to view, analyze, and optimize your Azure Monitor costs. Each is described in detail in the following sections.
Microsoft Cost Management + Billing
To get started analyzing your Azure Monitor charges, openCost Management + Billingin the Azure portal. This tool includes several built-in dashboards for deep cost analysis like cost by resource and invoice details. Access policies are describedhere. SelectCost Managementand thenCost analysis. Select your subscription or anotherscope.
Next, create aDaily Costsview, and change theGroup byto show costs byMeterso that you can see each the costs from each feature. The meter names for each Azure Monitor feature are listedhere.
Note
You might need additional access to use Cost Management data. SeeAssign access to Cost Management data.

To limit the view to Azure Monitor charges,create a filterfor the followingService names:
Azure Monitor
Log Analytics
Insight and Analytics
Application Insights
Usage incurred on a Log Analytics workspace can be billed on any of the first three services (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, or Insight and Analytics) depending on the feature. SeeAzure Monitor billing meter namesfor a list of the Azure Monitor billing meters for all Azure Monitor features.
Other services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel also bill their usage against Log Analytics workspace resources. SeeCommon cost analysis usesfor details on using this view. If you're using Microsoft Sentinel'ssimplified pricing tiers, log data ingestion is billed entirely on Sentinel meters.
If using an Azure Monitor Logs dedicated cluster, data ingestion usage may be billed against the cluster resource or each workspace that is joined to the clusterlearn more.
Note
Alternatively, you can go to theOverviewpage of a Log Analytics workspace or Application Insights resource and clickView Costin the upper right corner of theEssentialssection. This launches theCost Analysisfrom Microsoft Cost Management + Billing already scoped to the workspace or application. (You might need to use thepreview versionof the Azure portal to see this option.)

Automated mails and alerts
Rather than manually analyzing your costs in the Azure portal, you can automate delivery of information using the following methods.
Daily cost analysis emails.After you configure your Cost Analysis view, selectSubscribeat the top of the screen to receive regular email updates from Cost Analysis.
Budget alerts.To be notified if there are significant increases in your spending, create abudget alertsfor a single workspace or group of workspaces.
Export usage details
To gain deeper understanding of your usage and costs, create exports usingCost Analysis. SeeTutorial: Create and manage exported datato learn how to automatically create a daily export you can use for regular analysis.
These exports are in CSV format and contain a list of daily usage (billed quantity and cost) by resource,billing meter, and several other fields such asAdditionalInfo. You can use Microsoft Excel to do rich analyses of your usage not possible in theCost Analyticsexperiences in the portal.
For example, usage from Log Analytics can be found by first filtering on theMeter Categorycolumn to show:
Log Analytics(for Pay-as-you-go data ingestion and interactive Data Retention),
Insight and Analytics(used by some of the legacy pricing tiers), and
Azure Monitor(used by most other Log Analytics features such as Commitment Tiers, Basic Logs ingesting, Long-Term Retention, Search Queries, Search Jobs, and so on)
Add a filter on theInstance IDcolumn forcontains workspaceorcontains cluster. The usage is shown in theConsumed Quantitycolumn. The unit for each entry is shown in theUnit of Measurecolumn.
Note

View data allocation benefits
There are several approaches to view the benefits a workspace receives from offers that are part of other products. These offers are:
Defender for Servers data allowanceand
Microsoft Sentinel benefit for Microsoft 365 E5, A5, F5, and G5 customers.
Note
To receive the Defender for Servers data allowance on your Log Analytics workspace, theSecuritysolution must have beencreated on the workspace.
View benefits in a usage export
Since a usage export has both the number of units of usage and their cost, you can use this export to see the benefits you're receiving. In the usage export, to see the benefits, filter theInstance IDcolumn to your workspace. To select all of your workspaces in the spreadsheet, filter theInstance IDcolumn tocontains /workspaces/. Then filter on the Meter to either of the following 2 meters:
contains /workspaces/
Standard Data Included per Node: this meter is under the service "Insight and Analytics" and tracks the benefits received when a workspace in either in Log AnalyticsPer Node tierdata allowance and/or hasDefender for Serversenabled. Each of these allowances provides a 500 MB/server/day data allowance.

View benefits in Usage and estimated costs
You can also see these data benefits in the Log Analytics Usage and estimated costs page. If the workspace is receiving these benefits, there's a sentence below the cost estimate table that gives the data volume of the benefits used over the last 31 days.

Query benefits from the Operation table
TheOperationtable contains daily events which given the amount of benefit used from theDefender for Servers data allowanceand theMicrosoft Sentinel benefit for Microsoft 365 E5, A5, F5, and G5 customers. TheDetailcolumn for these events is in the formatBenefit amount used 1.234 GB, and the type of benefit is in theOperationKeycolumn. Here's a query that charts the benefits used in the last 31-days:

| where TimeGenerated >= ago(31d)
| where Detail startswith "Benefit amount used"
| parse Detail with "Benefit amount used: " BenefitUsedGB " GB"
| extend BenefitUsedGB = toreal(BenefitUsedGB)
| parse OperationKey with "Benefit type used: " BenefitType 
| project BillingDay=TimeGenerated, BenefitType, BenefitUsedGB

Note that for workspaces in the legacy Per Node pricing tier, the Defender benefit listed in theOperationtable only includes the benefit from the set of security tables eligible for the Defender benefit. In this pricing tier, the total benefit applied will include data allowances from the Per Node tier and Defender which are combined and applied to all tables.

Tip
If youincrease the data retentionof theOperationtable, you'll be able to view these benefit trends over longer periods.
Usage and estimated costs
You can get more usage details about Log Analytics workspaces and Application Insights resources from theUsage and Estimated Costsoption for each.
Log Analytics workspace
To learn about your usage trends and optimize your costs using the most cost-effectivecommitment tierfor your Log Analytics workspace, selectUsage and Estimated Costsfrom theLog Analytics workspacemenu in the Azure portal.

This view includes the following sections:
A. Estimated monthly charges based on usage from the past 31 days using the current pricing tier.B. Estimated monthly charges using different commitment tiers.C. Billable data ingestion by solution from the past 31 days.
To explore the data in more detail, select the icon in the upper-right corner of either chart to work with the query in Log Analytics.

Application insights
To learn about usage on your workspace-based resources, seeData volume trends for workspace-based resources.
To learn about usage on retired classic Application Insights resources, selectUsage and Estimated Costsfrom theApplicationsmenu in the Azure portal.

This view includes the following:
A. Estimated monthly charges based on usage from the past month.B. Billable data ingestion by table from the past month.
To investigate your Application Insights usage more deeply, open theMetricspage, add the metric namedData point volume, and then select theApply splittingoption to split the data by "Telemetry item type".
Operations Management Suite subscription entitlements
Customers who purchased Microsoft Operations Management Suite E1 and E2 are eligible for per-node data ingestion entitlements for Log Analytics and Application Insights. Each Application Insights node includes up to 200 MB of data ingested per day (separate from Log Analytics data ingestion), with 90-day data retention at no extra cost.
To receive these entitlements for Log Analytics workspaces or Application Insights resources in a subscription, they must use the Per-Node (OMS) pricing tier. This entitlement isn't visible in the estimated costs shown in the Usage and estimated cost pane.
Depending on the number of nodes of the suite that your organization purchased, moving some subscriptions into a Per GB (pay-as-you-go) pricing tier might be advantageous, but this change in pricing tier requires careful consideration.
Tip
If your organization has Microsoft Operations Management Suite E1 or E2, it's best to keep your Log Analytics workspaces in the Per-Node (OMS) pricing tier and your Application Insights resources in the Enterprise pricing tier.
Azure Migrate data benefits
Workspaces linked toclassic Azure Migratereceive free data benefits for the data tables related to Azure Migrate (ServiceMapProcess_CL,ServiceMapComputer_CL,VMBoundPort,VMConnection,VMComputer,VMProcess,InsightsMetrics). This version of Azure Migrate was retired in February 2024.

Starting from 1 July 2024, the data benefit for Azure Migrate in Log Analytics will no longer be available. We suggest moving to theAzure Migrate agentless dependency analysis. If you continue with agent-based dependency analysis, standardAzure Monitor chargesapply for the data ingestion that enables dependency visualization.
