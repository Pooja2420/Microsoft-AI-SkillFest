This article helps you onboard your Azure Arc-enabled machines toMicrosoft Sentinelto start collecting security-related events. Microsoft Sentinel provides a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response across the enterprise.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you meet the following requirements:

Onboard Azure Arc-enabled servers to Microsoft Sentinel
Microsoft Sentinel comes with many connectors for Microsoft solutions, available out of the box and providing real-time integration. For physical and virtual machines, you can install the Log Analytics agent that collects the logs and forwards them to Microsoft Sentinel. Azure Arc-enabled servers supports deploying the Log Analytics agent using the following methods:
Using the VM extensions framework.This feature in Azure Arc-enabled servers allows you to deploy the Log Analytics agent VM extension to a non-Azure Windows and/or Linux server. VM extensions can be managed using the following methods on your hybrid machines or servers managed by Azure Arc-enabled servers:TheAzure portalTheAzure CLIAzure PowerShellAzureResource Manager templates

Using Azure Policy.Using this approach, you use the Azure PolicyDeploy Log Analytics agent to Linux or Azure Arc machinesbuilt-in policy to audit if the Azure Arc-enabled server has the Log Analytics agent installed. If the agent isn't installed, it automatically deploys it using a remediation task. Alternatively, if you plan to monitor the machines with Azure Monitor for VMs, instead use theEnable Azure Monitor for VMsinitiative to install and configure the Log Analytics agent.

We recommend installing the Log Analytics agent for Windows or Linux using Azure Policy.
After your Arc-enabled servers are connected, your data starts streaming into Microsoft Sentinel and is ready for you to start working with. You can view the logs in thebuilt-in workbooksand start building queries in Log Analytics toinvestigate the data.
