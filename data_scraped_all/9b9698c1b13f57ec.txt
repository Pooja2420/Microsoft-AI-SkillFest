Virtual Machines Scale Sets provide a logical grouping of platform-managed virtual machines. With scale sets, you create a virtual machine configuration model, automatically add or remove additional instances based on CPU or memory load, and automatically upgrade to the latest OS version. Traditionally, scale sets allow you to create virtual machines using a VM configuration model provided at the time of scale set creation, and the scale set can only manage virtual machines that are implicitly created based on the configuration model.
Scale set orchestration modes allow you to have greater control over how virtual machine instances are managed by the scale set.
Important
The orchestration mode is defined when you create the scale set and cannot be changed or updated later.
Scale Sets with Flexible Orchestration (Recommended)
Optimized for high availability and scalability with identical or mixed virtual machine types. Flexible Orchestration is the reccomended orchestration mode when deploying scale sets in Azure.
Flexible orchestration provides a unified experience across the Azure VM ecosystem while offering enhanced availability guarantees (up to 1,000 VMs). VMs are automatically distributed across Availability Zone or fault domains within a region ensuring resilience for both stateless and stateful applications. Flexible orchestration supports a broad range of workloads, including quorum-based applications, open-source databases, and high-availability services. Additionally, it allows for dynamic instance mixing, enabling the use of different VM types, as well as a combination of Spot and on-demand instances, for optimized performance and cost efficiency. Flexible orchestration supports all key scale set features such as metrics-based autoscaling, instance protection, standby pools, upgrade policies, and more.
Scale Sets with Uniform Orchestration
Optimized for large-scale workloads with identical virtual machine instances.
Uniform orchestration ensures consistency by using a predefined virtual machine profile to deploy identical instances within a scale set. While some customization of individual VMs is possible, Uniform orchestration primarily manages VMs as a group. Individual instances are accessible via Virtual Machine Scale Set VM API commands but lack compatibility with standard Azure IaaS VM API commands, Azure Resource Manager tagging, RBAC, Azure Backup, or Azure Site Recovery. Uniform orchestration supports key scale set features, including metrics-based autoscaling, instance protection, and automatic OS upgrades.
What has changed with Flexible orchestration mode?
One of the main advantages of Flexible orchestration is that it provides orchestration features over standard Azure IaaS VMs, instead of scale set child virtual machines. This means you can use all of the standard VM APIs when managing Flexible orchestration instances, instead of the Virtual Machine Scale Set VM APIs you use with Uniform orchestration. There are several differences between managing instances in Flexible orchestration versus Uniform orchestration. In general, we recommend that you use the standard Azure IaaS VM APIs when possible. In this section, we highlight examples of best practices for managing VM instances with Flexible orchestration.
Flexible orchestration mode can be used with all VM sizes. Flexible orchestration mode provides the highest scale and configurability for VM sizes that supportâ¯memory preserving updates or live migration such as when using the B, D, E and F-series or when the scale set is configured for maximum spreading between instancesplatformFaultDomainCount=1. Currently, the Flexible orchestration mode has additional constraints for VM sizes that don't support memory preserving updates including the G, H, L, M, and N-series VMs and instances are spread across multiple fault domains. You can use theâ¯Compute Resource SKUs APIâ¯to determine whether a specific VM SKU support memory preserving updates.
platformFaultDomainCount=1
platformFaultDomainCount=1
platformFaultDomainCount > 1
FDCount = 1
Scale out with standard Azure virtual machines
Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Flexible Orchestration mode manage standard Azure VMs. You have full control over the virtual machine lifecycle, as well as network interfaces and disks using the standard Azure APIs and commands. Virtual machines created with Uniform orchestration mode are exposed and managed via the Virtual Machine Scale Set VM API commands. Individual instances aren't compatible with the standard Azure IaaS VM API commands, Azure management features such as Azure Resource Manager resource tagging RBAC permissions, Azure Backup, or Azure Site Recovery.
Assign fault domain during VM creation
You can choose the number of fault domains for the Flexible orchestration scale set. By default, when you add a VM to a Flexible scale set, Azure evenly spreads instances across fault domains. While it is recommended to let Azure assign the fault domain, for advanced or troubleshooting scenarios you can override this default behavior and specify the fault domain where the instance will land.
az vm create âvmss "myVMSS"  â-platform-fault-domain 1
az vm create âvmss "myVMSS"  â-platform-fault-domain 1
Instance naming
When you create a VM and add it to a Flexible scale set, you have full control over instance names within the Azure Naming convention rules. When VMs are automatically added to the scale set via autoscaling, you provide a prefix and Azure appends a unique number to the end of the name.
Query instances for power state
The preferred method is to use Azure Resource Graph to query for all VMs in a Virtual Machine Scale Set. Azure Resource Graph provides efficient query capabilities for Azure resources at scale across subscriptions.
resources
|â¯whereâ¯typeâ¯=~â¯'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
|â¯whereâ¯properties.virtualMachineScaleSet.idâ¯containsâ¯"demo"
|â¯extendâ¯powerStateâ¯=â¯properties.extended.instanceView.powerState.code
|â¯projectâ¯name,â¯resourceGroup,â¯location,â¯powerState
|â¯orderâ¯byâ¯resourceGroupâ¯desc,â¯nameâ¯desc

|â¯whereâ¯typeâ¯=~â¯'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
|â¯whereâ¯properties.virtualMachineScaleSet.idâ¯containsâ¯"demo"
|â¯extendâ¯powerStateâ¯=â¯properties.extended.instanceView.powerState.code
|â¯projectâ¯name,â¯resourceGroup,â¯location,â¯powerState
|â¯orderâ¯byâ¯resourceGroupâ¯desc,â¯nameâ¯desc
Querying resources withAzure Resource Graphis a convenient and efficient way to query Azure resources and minimizes API calls to the resource provider. Azure Resource Graph is an eventually consistent cache where new or updated resources may not be reflected for up to 60 seconds. You can:
List VMs in a resource group or subscription.
Use the expand option to retrieve the instance view (fault domain assignment, power and provisioning states) for all VMs in your subscription.
Use the Get VM API and commands to get model and instance view for a single instance.
Monitor application health
Application health monitoring allows your application to provide Azure with a heartbeat to determine whether your application is healthy or unhealthy. Azure can automatically replace VM instances that are unhealthy. When configuring application monitoring, you must install and configure the Application Health Extension if using Flexible Orchestration. For Uniform scale set instances, you can use either the Application Health Extension, or Health Probes.
List scale sets VM API changes
Virtual Machine Scale Sets allows you to list the instances that belong to the scale set. With Flexible orchestration, the list Virtual Machine Scale Sets VM command provides a list of scale sets VM IDs. You can then call the GET Virtual Machine Scale Sets VM commands to get more details on how the scale set is working with the VM instance. To get the details for many VMs in the scale set, useAzure Resource Graphor the standard List VM API and commands. Use the standard GET VM API and commands to get information on a single instance.
Retrieve boot diagnostics data
Use the standard VM APIs and commands to retrieve instance Boot Diagnostics data and screenshots. The Virtual Machine Scale Sets VM boot diagnostic APIs and commands aren't used with Flexible orchestration mode instances.
VM extensions
Use extensions targeted for standard virtual machines, instead of extensions targeted for Uniform orchestration mode instances.

The following table compares the Flexible orchestration mode, Uniform orchestration mode, and Availability Sets by their features.
