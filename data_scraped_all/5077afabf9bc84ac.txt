APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
Azure Monitor collects and aggregates metrics and logs from your system to monitor availability, performance, and resilience, and notify you of issues affecting your system. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API, or client libraries to set up and view monitoring data.
Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. This article describes the types of monitoring data you can collect for this service and ways to analyze that data.
Collect data with Azure Monitor
This table describes how you can collect data to monitor your service, and what you can do with the data once collected:
For the list of all of the data supported by Azure Monitor, see:
Azure Monitor supported metrics
Azure Monitor supported resource logs
Built in monitoring for API Management
Azure API management has the following built in monitoring features.
Get API analytics in Azure API Management
Azure API Management provides analytics for your APIs so that you can analyze their usage and performance. Use analytics for high-level monitoring and troubleshooting of your APIs. For other monitoring features, including near real-time metrics and resource logs for diagnostics and auditing, seeTutorial: Monitor published APIs.

Note
Currently, this feature isn't available inworkspaces.
API Management provides analytics using anAzure Monitor-based dashboard. The dashboard aggregates data in an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
In the classic API Management service tiers, your API Management instance also includeslegacy built-in analyticsin the Azure portal, and analytics data can be accessed using the API Management REST API. Closely similar data is shown in the Azure Monitor-based dashboard and built-in analytics.
Important
The Azure Monitor-based dashboard is the recommended way to access analytics data. Built-in (classic) analytics isn't available in the v2 tiers.
With API analytics, analyze the usage and performance of the APIs in your API Management instance across several dimensions, including:
Time
Geography
APIs
API operations
Products
Subscriptions
Users
Requests
API analytics provides data on requests, including failed and unauthorized requests. Geography values are based on IP address mapping. There can be a delay in the availability of analytics data.
To use the Azure Monitor-based dashboard, you need a Log Analytics workspace as a data source for API Management gateway logs.
If you need to configure one, the following are brief steps to send gateway logs to a Log Analytics workspace. For more information, seeTutorial: Monitor published APIs. This procedure is a one-time setup.
In theAzure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.
In the left-hand menu, underMonitoring, selectDiagnostic settings>+ Add diagnostic setting.
Enter a descriptive name for the diagnostic setting.
InLogs, selectLogs related to ApiManagement Gateway.
InDestination details, selectSend to Log Analyticsand select a Log Analytics workspace in the same or a different subscription. If you need to create a workspace, seeCreate a Log Analytics workspace.
Make sureResource specificis selected as the destination table.
SelectSave.
Important
A new Log Analytics workspace can take up to 2 hours to start receiving data. An existing workspace should start receiving data within approximately 15 minutes.
After a Log Analytics workspace is configured, access the Azure Monitor-based dashboard to analyze the usage and performance of your APIs.
In theAzure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.
In the left-hand menu, underMonitoring, selectAnalytics. The analytics dashboard opens.
Select a time range for data.
Select a report category for analytics data, such asTimeline,Geography, and so on.
Legacy built-in analytics
In certain API Management service tiers, built-in analytics (also calledlegacy analyticsorclassic analytics) is also available in the Azure portal, and analytics data can be accessed using the API Management REST API.
To access the built-in (classic) analytics in the Azure portal:
In theAzure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.
In the left-hand menu, underMonitoring, selectAnalytics (classic).
Select a time range for data, or enter a custom time range.
Select a report category for analytics data, such asTimeline,Geography, and so on.
Optionally, filter the report by one or more other categories.
UseReportsoperations in the API Management REST API to retrieve and filter analytics data for your API Management instance.
Available operations return report records by API, geography, API operations, product, request, subscription, time, or user.
Enable logging of developer portal usage in Azure API Management
This section shows you how to enable Azure Monitor logs for auditing and troubleshooting usage of the API Managementdeveloper portal. When enabled through a diagnostic setting, the logs collect information about the requests that are received and processed by the developer portal.
Developer portal usage logs include data about activity in the developer portal, including:
User authentication actions, such as sign-in and sign-out
Views of API details, API operation details, and products
API testing in the interactive test console
To configure a diagnostic setting for developer portal usage logs:
In theAzure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.

SelectSave.
Depending on the log destination you choose, it can take a few minutes for data to appear.
If you send logs to a storage account, you can access the data in the Azure portal and download it for analysis.
In theAzure portal, navigate to the storage account destination.
In the left menu, selectStorage Browser.
UnderBlob containers, selectinsights-logs-developerportalauditlogs.
Navigate to the container for the logs in your API Management instance. The logs are partitioned in intervals of 1 hour.
To retrieve the data for further analysis, selectDownload.
Use Azure Monitor tools to analyze the data
These Azure Monitor tools are available in the Azure portal to help you analyze monitoring data:
Some Azure services have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal. These dashboards are calledinsights, and you can find them in theInsightssection of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.
