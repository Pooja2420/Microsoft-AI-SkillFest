Remarks
If you have an external CI build system that produces artifacts, you can consume artifacts with a build resource. A build resource can be any external CI systems like Jenkins, TeamCity, CircleCI, and so on.
Important
Triggers are only supported for hosted Jenkins where Azure DevOps has line of sight with Jenkins server.
Examples
resources:
  builds:
  - build: Spaceworkz
    type: Jenkins
    connection: MyJenkinsServer 
    source: SpaceworkzProj   # name of the jenkins source project
    trigger: true
