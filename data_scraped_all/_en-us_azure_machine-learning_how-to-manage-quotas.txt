Azure uses quotas and limits to prevent budget overruns due to fraud, and to honor Azure capacity constraints. Consider these limits as you scale for production workloads. In this article, you learn about:
Default limits on Azure resources related toAzure Machine Learning.
Creating workspace-level quotas.
Viewing your quotas and limits.
Requesting quota increases.
Along with managing quotas and limits, you can learn how toplan and manage costs for Azure Machine Learningor learn about theservice limits in Azure Machine Learning.
Special considerations
Quotas are applied to each subscription in your account. If you have multiple subscriptions, you must request a quota increase for each subscription.

Default resource quotas and limits
In this section, you learn about the default and maximum quotas and limits for the following resources:
Azure Machine Learning assets
Azure Machine Learning computes (including serverless Spark)
Azure Machine Learning shared quota
Azure Machine Learning online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) and batch endpoints
Azure Machine Learning pipelines
Azure Machine Learning integration with Synapse
Virtual machines
Azure Container Instances
Azure Storage
Important
Limits are subject to change. For the latest information, seeService limits in Azure Machine Learning.
Azure Machine Learning assets
The following limits on assets apply on aper-workspacebasis.
In addition, the maximumrun timeis 30 days and the maximum number ofmetrics logged per runis 1 million.
Azure Machine Learning Compute
Azure Machine Learning Computehas a default quota limit on both thenumber of coresand thenumber of unique compute resourcesthat are allowed per region in a subscription.
Note
Thequota on the number of coresis split by each VM Family and cumulative total cores.
Thequota on the number of unique compute resourcesper region is separate from the VM core quota, as it applies only to the managed compute resources of Azure Machine Learning.
To raise the limits for the following items,Request a quota increase:
VM family core quotas. To learn more about which VM family to request a quota increase for, seevirtual machine sizes in Azure. For example, GPU VM families start with an "N" in their family name (such as the NCv3 series).
Total subscription core quotas
Cluster quota
Other resources in this section
Available resources:
Dedicated cores per regionhave a default limit of 24 to 300, depending on your subscription offer type. You can increase the number of dedicated cores per subscription for each VM family. Specialized VM families like NCv2, NCv3, or ND series start with a default of zero cores. GPUs also default to zero cores.

Total compute limit per regionhas a default limit of 500 per region within a given subscription and can be increased up to a maximum value of 2500 per region. This limit is shared between training clusters, compute instances, and managed online endpoint deployments. A compute instance is considered a single-node cluster for quota purposes.

The following table shows more limits in the platform. Reach out to the Azure Machine Learning product team through atechnicalsupport ticket to request an exception.
1Maximum lifetime is the duration between when a job starts and when it finishes. Completed jobs persist indefinitely. Data for jobs not completed within the maximum lifetime isn't accessible.
2Jobs on a low-priority node can be preempted whenever there's a capacity constraint. We recommend that you implement checkpoints in your job.
Azure Machine Learning shared quota
Azure Machine Learning provides a shared quota pool from which users across various regions can access quota to perform testing for a limited amount of time, depending upon availability. The specific time duration depends on the use case. By temporarily using quota from the quota pool, you no longer need to file a support ticket for a short-term quota increase or wait for your quota request to be approved before you can proceed with your workload.
Use of the shared quota pool is available for running Spark jobs and for testing inferencing for Llama-2, Phi, Nemotron, Mistral, Dolly, and Deci-DeciLM models from the Model Catalog for a short time. Before you can deploy these models via the shared quota, you must have anEnterprise Agreement subscription. For more information on how to use the shared quota for online endpoint deployment, seeHow to deploy foundation models using the studio.
You should use the shared quota only for creating temporary test endpoints, not production endpoints. For endpoints in production, you should request dedicated quota byfiling a support ticket. Billing for shared quota is usage-based, just like billing for dedicated virtual machine families. To opt out of shared quota for Spark jobs, fill out theAzure Machine Learning shared capacity allocation opt out form.
Azure Machine Learning online endpoints and batch endpoints
Azure Machine Learning online endpoints and batch endpoints have resource limits described in the following table.
Important
These limits areregional, meaning that you can use up to these limits per each region you're using. For example, if your current limit for number of endpoints per subscription is 100, you can create 100 endpoints in the East US region, 100 endpoints in the West US region, and 100 endpoints in each of the other supported regions in a single subscription. Same principle applies to all the other limits.
To determine the current usage for an endpoint,view the metrics.
To request an exception from the Azure Machine Learning product team, use the steps in theEndpoint limit increases.
Begin with a letter
Be 3-32 characters in length

For Kubernetes endpoint, the endpoint name plus deployment name must be 6-62 characters in total length

1This is a regional limit. For example, if current limit on number of endpoints is 100, you can create 100 endpoints in the East US region, 100 endpoints in the West US region, and 100 endpoints in each of the other supported regions in a single subscription. Same principle applies to all the other limits.
2Single dashes like,my-endpoint-name, are accepted in endpoint and deployment names.
my-endpoint-name
3Endpoints and deployments can be of different types, but limits apply to the sum of all types. For example, the sum of managed online endpoints, Kubernetes online endpoint and batch endpoint under each subscription can't exceed 100 per region by default. Similarly, the sum of managed online deployments, Kubernetes online deployments, and batch deployments under each subscription can't exceed 500 per region by default.
4We reserve 20% extra compute resources for performing upgrades. For example, if you request 10 instances in a deployment, you must have a quota for 12. Otherwise, you receive an error. There are some VM SKUs that are exempt from extra quota. For more information on quota allocation, seevirtual machine quota allocation for deployment.
5The request timeout maximum is 180 seconds unless it is a flow (prompt flow) deployment. The maximum request timeout for a flow deployment is 300 seconds. For more information on the timeout with flow deployments, seedeploy a flow in prompt flow.
6Requests per second, connections, bandwidth, etc. are related. If you request to increase any of these limits, ensure that you estimate/calculate other related limits together.
For managed online endpoints, Azure Machine Learning reserves 20% of your compute resources for performing upgrades on some VM SKUs. If you request a given number of instances for those VM SKUs in a deployment, you must have a quota forceil(1.2 * number of instances requested for deployment) * number of cores for the VM SKUavailable to avoid getting an error. For example, if you request 10 instances of aStandard_DS3_v2VM (that comes with four cores) in a deployment, you should have a quota for 48 cores (12 instances * 4 cores) available. This extra quota is reserved for system-initiated operations such as OS upgrades and VM recovery, and it won't incur cost unless such operations run.
ceil(1.2 * number of instances requested for deployment) * number of cores for the VM SKU
12 instances * 4 cores
There are certain VM SKUs that are exempted from extra quota reservation. To view the full list, seeManaged online endpoints SKU list.
To view your usage and request quota increases, seeView your usage and quotas in the Azure portal. To view your cost of running a managed online endpoint, seeView costs for a managed online endpoint.
Azure Machine Learning pipelines
Azure Machine Learning pipelineshave the following limits.
Azure Machine Learning integration with Synapse
Azure Machine Learning serverless Spark provides easy access to distributed computing capability for scaling Apache Spark jobs. Serverless Spark utilizes the same dedicated quota as Azure Machine Learning Compute. Quota limits can be increased by submitting a support ticket andrequesting for quota and limit increasefor ESv3 series under the "Machine Learning Service: Virtual Machine Quota" category.
To view quota usage, navigate to Machine Learning studio and select the subscription name that you would like to see usage for. Select "Quota" in the left panel.

Virtual machines
Each Azure subscription has a limit on the number of virtual machines across all services. Virtual machine cores have a regional total limit and a regional limit per size series. Both limits are separately enforced.
For example, consider a subscription with a US East total VM core limit of 30, an A series core limit of 30, and a D series core limit of 30. This subscription would be allowed to deploy 30 A1 VMs, or 30 D1 VMs, or a combination of the two that doesn't exceed a total of 30 cores.
You can't raise limits for virtual machines above the values shown in the following table.
1You can apply up to 50 tags directly to a subscription. Within the subscription, each resource or resource group is also limited to 50 tags. However, the subscription can contain an unlimited number of tags that are dispersed across resources and resource groups.
2Resource Manager returns alist of tag name and valuesin the subscription only when the number of unique tags is 80,000 or less. A unique tag is defined by the combination of resource ID, tag name, and tag value. For example, two resources with the same tag name and value would be calculated as two unique tags. You still can find a resource by tag when the number exceeds 80,000.
3Deployments are automatically deleted from the history as you near the limit. For more information, seeAutomatic deletions from deployment history.
Container Instances
For more information, seeContainer Instances limits.
Storage
Azure Storage has a limit of 250 storage accounts per region, per subscription. This limit includes both Standard and Premium storage accounts.
Workspace-level quotas
Use workspace-level quotas to manage Azure Machine Learning compute target allocation between multipleworkspacesin the same subscription.
By default, all workspaces share the same quota as the subscription-level quota for VM families. However, you can set a maximum quota for individual VM families on workspaces in a subscription. Quotas for individual VM families let you share capacity and avoid resource contention issues.
Go to any workspace in your subscription.
In the left pane, selectUsages + quotas.
Select theConfigure quotastab to view the quotas.
Expand a VM family.
Set a quota limit on any workspace listed under that VM family.
You can't set a negative value or a value higher than the subscription-level quota.

Note
You need subscription-level permissions to set a quota at the workspace level.
View quotas in the studio
When you create a new compute resource, by default you see only VM sizes that you already have quota to use.  Switch the view toSelect from all options.
