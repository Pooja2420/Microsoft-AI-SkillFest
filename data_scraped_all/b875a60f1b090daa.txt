Applies to:âï¸ Linux VMs
Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI)allows cloud providers, such as Azure, to:
Mirror Red Hat-hosted repository content
Create custom repositories with Azure-specific content
Make the content available to end-user Virtual Machines (VMs)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) images come preconfigured to access Azure RHUI. No other configuration is needed. To get the latest updates, runsudo yum updateafter your RHEL instance is ready. This service is included as part of the RHEL PAYG software fees. For more information on RHEL images in Azure, including publishing and retention policies, seeOverview of Red Hat Enterprise Linux images in Azure.
sudo yum update
For more information on Red Hat support policies for all versions of RHEL, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle.
Important
RHUI is intended only for pay-as-you-go (PAYG) images. For golden images, also known as bring your own subscription (BYOS), the system needs to be attached to Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) or Satellite in order to receive updates. For more information, seeHow to register and subscribe a RHEL system.
Important information about Azure RHUI
Azure RHUI is the update infrastructure that supports all RHEL PAYG VMs created in Azure. This infrastructure doesn't prevent you from registering your PAYG RHEL VMs with Subscription Manager, Satellite, or another source of updates. Registering with a different source with a PAYG VM results in indirect double-billing. See the following point for details.

This infrastructure doesn't prevent you from registering your PAYG RHEL VMs with Subscription Manager, Satellite, or another source of updates. Registering with a different source with a PAYG VM results in indirect double-billing. See the following point for details.
Access to the Azure-hosted RHUI is included in the RHEL PAYG image price. Unregistering a PAYG RHEL VM from the Azure-hosted RHUI doesn't convert the virtual machine into a BYOS type of VM. If you register the same VM with another source of updates, you might incurindirectdouble charges. You're charged the first time for the Azure RHEL software fee. You're charged the second time for Red Hat subscriptions that were purchased previously. If you consistently need to use an update infrastructure other than Azure-hosted RHUI, consider registering to useRHEL BYOS images.

RHEL SAP PAYG images in Azure are connected to dedicated RHUI channels that remain on the specific RHEL minor version as required for SAP certification. RHEL SAP PAYG images in Azure include RHEL for SAP, RHEL for SAP HANA, and RHEL for SAP Business Applications.

Access to Azure-hosted RHUI is limited to the VMs within theAzure datacenter IP ranges. If you proxy all VM traffic by using an on-premises network infrastructure, you might need to set up user-defined routes for the RHEL PAYG VMs to access the Azure RHUI. If that is the case, user-defined routes need to be added forallRHUI IP addresses.

Image update behavior
The Red Hat images provided in Azure Marketplace are connected by default to one of two different types of life-cycle repositories:
Non-EUS: Has the latest available software published by Red Hat for their particular Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) repositories.
Non-EUS: Has the latest available software published by Red Hat for their particular Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) repositories.
Extended Update Support (EUS): Updates for a specific RHEL minor release.
Extended Update Support (EUS): Updates for a specific RHEL minor release.
Note
For more information on RHEL EUS, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Life CycleandRed Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Update Support Overview.
The packages contained in the Red Hat Update Infrastructure repositories are published and maintained by Red Hat. Extra packages to support custom Azure services are published in independent repositories maintained by Microsoft.
For a full image list, runaz vm image list --offer RHEL --all -p RedHat --output tableusing the Azure CLI.
az vm image list --offer RHEL --all -p RedHat --output table
Images connected to non-EUS repositories
For RHEL VM images connected to non-EUS repositories, runningsudo yum updatewill upgrade to the latest RHEL minor version. For example, if you provision a VM from a RHEL 8.4 PAYG image and runsudo yum update, you end up with a RHEL 8.9 VM, the latest minor version in the RHEL8 family.
sudo yum update
sudo yum update
Images that are connected to non-EUS repositories don't contain a minor version number in the SKU. The SKU is the third element in the image name. For example, all of the following images come attached to non-EUS repositories:
RedHat:RHEL:7-LVM:7.9.2023032012
RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.7.2023022813
RedHat:RHEL:9-lvm:9.1.2022112101
RedHat:rhel-raw:7-raw:7.9.2022040605
RedHat:rhel-raw:8-raw:8.6.2022052413
RedHat:rhel-raw:9-raw:9.1.2022112101
RedHat:RHEL:7-LVM:7.9.2023032012
RedHat:RHEL:8-LVM:8.7.2023022813
RedHat:RHEL:9-lvm:9.1.2022112101
RedHat:rhel-raw:7-raw:7.9.2022040605
RedHat:rhel-raw:8-raw:8.6.2022052413
RedHat:rhel-raw:9-raw:9.1.2022112101
The SKUs are either X-LVM or X-RAW. The minor version is indicated in the version of these images, which is the fourth element in the name.
Images connected to EUS repositories
If you provision a VM from a RHEL image that is connected to EUS repositories, it isn't upgraded to the latest RHEL minor version when you runsudo yum update. This situation happens because the images connected to EUS repositories are also version-locked to their specific minor version.
sudo yum update
Images connected to EUS repositories contain a minor version number in the SKU. For example, all of the following images come attached to EUS repositories:
RedHat:RHEL:7.7:7.7.2022051301
RedHat:RHEL:8_4:latest
RedHat:RHEL:9_0:9.0.2023061412
RedHat:RHEL:7.7:7.7.2022051301
RedHat:RHEL:8_4:latest
RedHat:RHEL:9_0:9.0.2023061412
Note
For RHEL8, the following are EUS releases: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.6 and 8.8. RHEL 8.3, 8.5 and 8.7 aren't EUS releases.
RHEL 8.10 is the final release and falls under standard maintenance, not EUS.
RHEL EUS and version-locking RHEL VMs
Extended Update Support (EUS) repositories are available to customers who might want to lock their RHEL VMs to a certain RHEL minor release after provisioning the VM. You can version-lock your RHEL VM to a specific minor version by updating the repositories to point to the Extended Update Support repositories. You can also undo the EUS version-locking operation.
Note
The RHEL Extras channel does not follow the EUS lifecycle. This means that if you install a package from the RHEL Extras channel, it will not be specific to the EUS release you are on. Red Hat does not support installing content from the RHEL Extras channel while on an EUS release. For more information, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Extras Product Life Cycle.
Support for EUS RHEL7 ended in June 30, 2024. For more information, seeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Maintenance.

Troubleshoot connection problems to Azure RHUI
If you experience problems connecting to Azure RHUI from your Azure RHEL PAYG VM, follow these steps:
Inspect the VM configuration for the Azure RHUI endpoint:Check whether the/etc/yum.repos.d/rh-cloud.repofile contains a reference torhui-[1-4].microsoft.comin thebaseurlof the[rhui-microsoft-azure-rhel*]section of the file. If it does, you're using the new Azure RHUI.If the reference points to a location with the following pattern,mirrorlist.*cds[1-4].cloudapp.net, a configuration update is required. You're using the old VM snapshot, and you need to update it to point to the new Azure RHUI.

Infrastructure update
In September 2016, Azure deployed an updated Azure RHUI. In April 2017, the old Azure RHUI was shut down. If you have been using the RHEL PAYG images or their snapshots from September 2016 or later, you're automatically connecting to the new Azure RHUI. If, however, you have older snapshots on your VMs, you need to manually update their configuration to access the Azure RHUI as described in a following section.
The new Azure RHUI servers are deployed withAzure Traffic Manager. In Traffic Manager, any VM can use a single endpoint, rhui-1.microsoft.com, and rhui4-1.microsoft.com, regardless of region.
Manual update procedure to use the Azure RHUI servers
This procedure is provided for reference only. RHEL PAYG images already have the correct configuration to connect to Azure RHUI. To manually update the configuration to use the Azure RHUI servers, complete the following steps:
