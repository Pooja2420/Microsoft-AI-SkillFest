Learn how to enforce compliance policies on your Azure resources before and after deployment with Azure Pipelines. Azure Pipelines lets you build, test, and deploy with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) usingAzure DevOps. One scenario for adding Azure Policy to a pipeline is when you want to ensure that resources are deployed only to authorized regions and are configured to send diagnostics logs to Azure Log Analytics.
You can use either theclassic pipelineorYAML pipelineprocesses to implement Azure Policy in your CI/CD pipelines.
For more information, seeWhat is Azure Pipelines?andCreate your first pipeline.

If you're using a YAML pipeline definition, then use theAzurePolicyCheckGate@0Azure Pipelines task.
Validate for any violation(s) during a release
Note
Use theAzurePolicyCheckGatetask to check for policy compliance in YAML. This task can only be used as a gate and not in a build or a release pipeline.
