Important
Azure Front Door (classic) will be retired onMarch 31, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure Front Door (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by March 2027. For more information, seeAzure Front Door (classic) retirement.
This article explains how to enable HTTPS for a custom domain associated with your Front Door (classic). Using HTTPS on your custom domain (for example,https://www.contoso.com) ensures secure data transmission via TLS/SSL encryption. When a web browser connects to a website using HTTPS, it validates the website's security certificate and verifies its legitimacy, providing security and protecting your web applications from malicious attacks.
https://www.contoso.com
Azure Front Door supports HTTPS by default on its default hostname (for example,https://contoso.azurefd.net). However, you need to enable HTTPS separately for custom domains likewww.contoso.com.
https://contoso.azurefd.net
www.contoso.com
Key attributes of the custom HTTPS feature include:
No extra cost: No costs for certificate acquisition, renewal, or HTTPS traffic.
Simple enablement: One-select provisioning via theAzure portal, REST API, or other developer tools.
Complete certificate management: Automatic certificate procurement and renewal, eliminating the risk of service interruption due to expired certificates.
In this tutorial, you learn to:
Enable HTTPS on your custom domain.
Use an AFD-managed certificate.
Use your own TLS/SSL certificate.
Validate the domain.
Disable HTTPS on your custom domain.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have a Front Door with at least one custom domain onboarded. For more information, seeTutorial: Add a custom domain to your Front Door.
TLS/SSL certificates
To enable HTTPS on a Front Door (classic) custom domain, you need a TLS/SSL certificate. You can either use a certificate managed by Azure Front Door or your own certificate.
Option 1 (default): Use a certificate managed by Front Door
Using a certificate managed by Azure Front Door allows you to enable HTTPS with a few settings changes. Azure Front Door handles all certificate management tasks, including procurement and renewal. If your custom domain is already mapped to the Front Door's default frontend host ({hostname}.azurefd.net), no further action is required. Otherwise, you must validate your domain ownership via email.
{hostname}.azurefd.net
To enable HTTPS on a custom domain:
In theAzure portal, go to yourFront Doorprofile.
In theAzure portal, go to yourFront Doorprofile.
Select the custom domain you want to enable HTTPS for from the list of frontend hosts.

Proceed toValidate the domain.
Note
DigiCertâs 64 character limit is enforced for Azure Front Door-managed certificates. Validation will fail if this limit is exceeded.
Enabling HTTPS via Front Door managed certificate is not supported for apex/root domains (e.g., contoso.com). Use your own certificate for this scenario (see Option 2).
Option 2: Use your own certificate
You can use your own certificate through an integration with Azure Key Vault. Ensure your certificate is from aMicrosoft Trusted CA Listand has a complete certificate chain.
Create a key vault account in the same Azure subscription as your Front Door.
Configure your key vault to allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass the firewall if network access restrictions are enabled.
Use theKey Vault access policypermission model.
Upload your certificate as acertificateobject, not asecret.
Note
Front Door doesn't support certificates with elliptic curve (EC) cryptography algorithms. The certificate must have a complete certificate chain with leaf and intermediate certificates, and root CA must be part of theMicrosoft Trusted CA list.
Register the Azure Front Door service principal in your Microsoft Entra ID using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.

Validate the domain
If your custom domain is mapped to your custom endpoint with a CNAME record or you're using your own certificate, continue toCustom domain is mapped to your Front Door. Otherwise, follow the instructions inCustom domain isn't mapped to your Front Door.
Custom domain is mapped to your Front Door by a CNAME record
If your CNAME record still exists and doesn't contain the afdverify subdomain, DigiCert automatically validates ownership of your custom domain.
Your CNAME record should be in the following format:
For more information about CNAME records, seeCreate the CNAME DNS record.
If your CNAME record is correct, DigiCert automatically verifies your custom domain and creates a dedicated certificate. The certificate is valid for one year and autorenews before it expires. Continue toWait for propagation.
Note
If you have a Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) record with your DNS provider, it must include DigiCert as a valid CA. For more information, seeManage CAA records.
Custom domain isn't mapped to your Front Door
If the CNAME record entry for your endpoint no longer exists or contains the afdverify subdomain, follow these instructions.
After enabling HTTPS on your custom domain, DigiCert validates ownership by contacting the domain's registrant via email or phone listed in the WHOIS registration. You must complete domain validation within six business days. DigiCert domain validation works at the subdomain level.

DigiCert also sends a verification email to the following addresses if the WHOIS registrant information is private:
admin@<your-domain-name.com>
administrator@<your-domain-name.com>
webmaster@<your-domain-name.com>
hostmaster@<your-domain-name.com>
postmaster@<your-domain-name.com>
You should receive an email asking you to approve the request. If you don't receive an email within 24 hours, contact Microsoft support.
After approval, DigiCert completes the certificate creation. The certificate is valid for one year and autorenews if the CNAME record is mapped to your Azure Front Door's default hostname.
Note
Managed certificate autorenewal requires that your custom domain be directly mapped to your Front Door's default .azurefd.net hostname by a CNAME record.
Wait for propagation
After domain validation, it can take up to 6-8 hours for the custom domain HTTPS feature to be activated. When complete, the custom HTTPS status in the Azure portal is set toEnabled.
Operation progress
The following table shows the operation progress when enabling HTTPS:
* This message appears only if an error occurs.
If an error occurs before the request is submitted, the following error message is displayed:
We encountered an unexpected error while processing your HTTPS request. Please try again and contact support if the issue persists.
Frequently asked questions

What if I don't receive the domain verification email from DigiCert?If you have a CNAME entry for your custom domain that points directly to your endpoint hostname and you aren't using the afdverify subdomain name, you don't receive a domain verification email. Validation occurs automatically. Otherwise, if you don't have a CNAME entry and didn't receive an email within 24 hours, contact Microsoft support.
