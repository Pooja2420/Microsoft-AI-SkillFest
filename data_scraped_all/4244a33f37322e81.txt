Weâre expanding support in GitHub Advanced Security to include results with URI locations, providing broader coverage from container and dynamic scanning tools.
Weâve also improved how GitHub pull requests connect to Azure Boards work items, making it easier to keep work item states up to date when pull requests are merged.
Check out the release notes for details.

General
Manage high privilege scopes, pipeline decorators, and unpublished extensions
Azure DevOps extensions improve product functionality and workflows, but those with high privilege scopes may pose various risks.
We've added a new feature that flags these scopes on each organization's admin page and the Visual Studio Marketplace installation page, helping administrators make informed decisions. Unpublished extensions and pipeline decorators are also flagged for administrator awareness and appropriate actions.

GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps
Advanced Security now accepts results with URI locations
Previously, Advanced Security rejected SARIF files that contained results with URIs listed as the alert location. This typically affected container scanning tools and dynamic application scanning tools. Advanced Security can now conditionally accept and display findings from these tools.
To enable this feature, set the pipeline variableadvancedsecurity.publish.allowmissingpartialfingerprints.
advancedsecurity.publish.allowmissingpartialfingerprints
trigger: none

variables:
  advancedsecurity.publish.allowmissingpartialfingerprints: true


jobs:
  - job: "AdvancedSecurityPublish"
    displayName: "ð¡ Publish ZAP SARIF"
    steps:
      - task: AdvancedSecurity-Publish@1
        displayName: Publish to ZAP SARIF to Advanced Security
        inputs:
          SarifsInputDirectory: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/sarifs/
trigger: none

variables:
  advancedsecurity.publish.allowmissingpartialfingerprints: true


jobs:
  - job: "AdvancedSecurityPublish"
    displayName: "ð¡ Publish ZAP SARIF"
    steps:
      - task: AdvancedSecurity-Publish@1
        displayName: Publish to ZAP SARIF to Advanced Security
        inputs:
          SarifsInputDirectory: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/sarifs/

GitHub Integration: State Transition Support
Weâve expanded our support for linking GitHub pull requests to Azure Boards work items! Previously, only theFixes AB#{ID}keyword was supported. With this update, you can now use{State or Category} AB#{ID}to automatically transition work items to the desired state on merge.
Fixes AB#{ID}
{State or Category} AB#{ID}
If the GitHub pull request description includes a state name (e.g.,Validate AB#1234), the linked work item's state will be updated as a result. If the state name isnât recognized, we check if it matches a state category (likeResolved). If it does, the work item is transitioned to the first available state within that category.
Validate AB#1234
Resolved

If no matching state or category is found, the keyword is ignored and the state on the work item won't be updated.
Finally, theFixes AB#{ID}keyword continues to work as expected, defaulting to the "Closed" state value.
Fixes AB#{ID}

Note
These features will roll out over the next two to three weeks.
