Customers can visitService providersin theAzure portalfor control and visibility of their service providers who useAzure Lighthouse. InService providers, customers can delegate specific resources, review new or updated offers, remove service provider access, and more.
To accessService providersin the Azure portal, enter "Service providers" in the search box in the Azure portal page header. You can also navigate toAzure Lighthousein the Azure portal, then selectView service provider offers.
Note
To viewService providers, a user in the customer's tenant must have theReader built-in role(or another built-in role which includes Reader access).
To add or update offers, delegate resources, and remove offers, the user must have a role with theMicrosoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/writepermission, such asOwner.
Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
Service providersonly shows information about the service providers that have access to the customer's subscriptions or resource groups through Azure Lighthouse. It doesn't show information about any additional service providers who don't use Azure Lighthouse.
View service provider details
To view details about the current service providers who use Azure Lighthouse to work on the customer's tenant, selectService provider offersfrom the service menu ofService providers.
Each offer shows the service provider's name and the offer associated with it. Select an offer to view a description and other details, including the role assignments that the service provider was granted.
In theDelegationscolumn for an offer you can see how many subscriptions and/or resource groups were delegated to the service provider. The service provider can work on these subscriptions and/or resource groups according to the access levels specified in the offer.
Add service provider offers
You can add a new service provider offer inService provider offers.
To add an offer from the marketplace, selectAdd offerin the command bar, then chooseAdd via marketplace. To viewManaged Service offersthat were published specifically for a customer, selectPrivate products. Otherwise, search for a public offer. When you find the offer you're interested in, select it to review details. To add the offer, selectCreate, then provide any necessary information.
To add an offer from a template, selectAdd offerin the command bar, then chooseAdd via template. TheUpload Offer Templatepane appears, allowing you to upload a template from your service provider and onboard your subscription (or resource group). For detailed steps, seeDeploy in the Azure portal.
Update service provider offers
After a customer adds an offer, a service provider may publish an updated version of the same offer to Azure Marketplace, such as to add a new role definition. If a new version of the offer is published, an "update" icon appears in the row for that offer. Select this icon to see the changes in the current version of the offer.

After reviewing the changes, you can choose to update to the new version. When you do so, the authorizations and other settings specified in the new version apply to any subscriptions and/or resource groups that were previously delegated for that offer.
Remove service provider offers
You can remove a service provider offer at any time by selecting the trash can icon in the row for that offer.
Once you confirm the deletion, that service provider can no longer access the resources that were formerly delegated for that offer.
Important
If a subscription has two or more offers from the same service provider, removing one of them could cause some service provider users to lose the access granted via the other delegations. This problem only occurs when the same user and role are included in multiple delegations, then one of the delegations is removed. To restore access, theonboarding processshould be repeated for the offers that you don't want to remove.
Delegate resources
Before a service provider can access and manage a customer's resources, one or more specific subscriptions and/or resource groups must be delegated. When a customer adds an offer without delegating any resources, a note appears at the top of theService provider offerssection. The service provider can't work on any resources in the customer's tenant until the delegation is completed.
To delegate subscriptions or resource groups:
Check the box for the row containing the service provider, offer, and name. Then selectDelegate resourcesat the top of the screen.
In theOffer detailssection of theDelegate resourcespane, review the details about the service provider and offer. To review role assignments for the offer, selectClick here to see the details of the selected offer.
In theDelegatesection, selectDelegate subscriptionsorDelegate resource groups.
Choose the subscriptions and/or resource groups you'd like to delegate for this offer, then selectAdd.
Select the checkbox to confirm that you want to grant this service provider access to these resources, then selectDelegate.
View delegations
Delegations represent an association of specific customer resources (subscriptions and/or resource groups) with role assignments that grant permissions to the service provider for those resources. To view delegation details, selectDelegationsfrom the service menu.
Filters at the top of the pane let you sort and group your delegation information. You can also filter by specific service providers, offers, or keywords.
Note
Whenviewing role assignments for the delegated scope in the Azure portalor via APIs, customers can't see role assignments for users from the service provider tenant who have access through Azure Lighthouse. Similarly, users in the service provider tenant can't see role assignments for users in a customer's tenant, regardless of the role they've been assigned.
Classic administratorassignments in a customer tenant may be visible to users in the managing tenant, or the other way around, because classic administrator roles don't use the Resource Manager deployment model.
Audit and restrict delegations in your environment
Customers may want to review all subscriptions and/or resource groups that are delegated to Azure Lighthouse, or place restrictions on the tenants to which they can be delegated. These options are especially useful for customers with a large number of subscriptions, or who have many users who perform management tasks.
We provide anAzure Policy built-in policy definitiontoaudit delegation of scopes to a managing tenant. You can assign this policy to a management group that includes all of the subscriptions that you want to audit. When you check for compliance with this policy, any delegated subscriptions and/or resource groups within that management group are shown in a noncompliant state. You can then review the results and confirm that there are no unexpected delegations.
Anotherbuilt-in policy definitionlets yourestrict delegations to specific managing tenants. This policy can be assigned to a management group that includes all subscriptions for which you want to limit delegations. After the policy is deployed, any attempts to delegate a subscription to a tenant outside of the ones you specify are denied.
For more information about how to assign a policy and view compliance state results, seeQuickstart: Create a policy assignment.
