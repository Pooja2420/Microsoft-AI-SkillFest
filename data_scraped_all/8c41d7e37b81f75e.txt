Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that involves the management of infrastructure, such as networks, compute services, databases, storages, and connection topology, in a descriptive model. IaC allows teams to develop and release changes faster and with greater confidence. Benefits of IaC include:
Increased confidence in deployments
Ability to manage multiple environments
Improved understanding of the state of infrastructure
For more information about the benefits of using Infrastructure as Code, seeRepeatable infrastructure.
Tooling
There are two approaches you can take when implementing Infrastructure as Code.
Imperative Infrastructure as Codeinvolves writing scripts in languages like Bash or PowerShell. You explicitly state commands that are executed to produce a desired outcome. When you use imperative deployments, it's up to you to manage the sequence of dependencies, error control, and resource updates.
Declarative Infrastructure as Codeinvolves writing a definition that defines how you want your environment to look. In this definition, you specify a desired outcome rather than how you want it to be accomplished. The tooling figures out how to make the outcome happen by inspecting your current state, comparing it to your target state, and then applying the differences.

Bicep
Bicepis a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. In Bicep files, you define the infrastructure you intend to deploy and its properties. Compared to ARM templates, Bicep files are easier to read and write for a non-developer audience because they use a concise syntax.

Infrastructure as Code modules
One of the goals of using code to deploy infrastructure is to avoid duplicating work or creating multiple templates for the same or similar purposes. Infrastructure modules should be reusable and flexible and should have a clear purpose.
Modules are independent files, typically containing set of resources meant to be deployed together. Modules allow you to break complex templates into smaller, more manageable sets of code. You can ensure that each module focuses on a specific task and that all modules are reusable for multiple deployments and workloads.
Bicep modules
Bicep allows you to create and call modules. Once modules are created, they can be consumed from any other Bicep template. A high quality Bicep module should define multiple related resources. For example, when you define an Azure function, you typically deploy a particular application, a hosting plan for that application, and a storage account for that applicationÂ´s metadata. These components are separately defined, but they form a logical grouping of resources, so you should consider defining them together as a module.
Bicep modules commonly use:
Parametersto accept values from a calling module.
Output valuesto return results to a calling module.
Resourcesto define one or more infrastructure objects for a module to manage.
You have several options for publishing and sharing Bicep modules.
Public registry:The public module registry is hosted in a Microsoft container registry (MCR). Its source code and the modules it contains are stored inGitHub.
Private registry:You can use Azure container registry to publish modules to a private registry. For information on publishing modules to a registry in a CI/CD pipeline, seeBicep and GitHub Actions, or if you prefer,Bicep and Azure Pipelines.
Template Spec:You can usetemplate specsto publish Bicep modules. Template specs are meant to be complete templates, but Bicep allows you to use template specs to deploy modules.
Version control system:You can load modules directly from version control tools like GitHub or Azure DevOps.
Terraform modules
Terraform allows you to create and call modules. Each Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as itsroot module, consisting of resources defined in.tffiles in your main working directory. Each module can call other modules, which allows you to include child modules in your main configuration file. Modules can also be called multiple times within the same configuration or from different configurations.
.tf
Modules are defined with all of the same configuration language concepts. They most commonly use:
Input variablesto accept values from a calling module.
Output valuesto return results to a calling module.
Resourcesto define one or more infrastructure objects for a module to manage.
You have several options for publishing and sharing Terraform modules:
Public registry:HashiCorp has their own Terraform Module Registry that allows users to generate sharable Terraform modules. There are currently severalAzure modulespublished in the Terraform Module Registry.
Private registry:You can seamlessly publish Terraform modules to a private repository like Terraform Cloud Private Registry or Azure Container Registry.
Version control system:You can load private modules directly from version control tools like GitHub. For information on supported sources, seeTerraform module sources.
Design considerations
Consider using IaC when deploying landing zone resources to Azure. IaC fully realizes deployment optimization, reduces configuration effort, and automates the entire environmentÂ´s deployments.

Consider deployment scopes. Have a good understanding ofAzure management levels and hierarchy. Each IaC deployment must know the scope at which Azure resources are deployed.

Determine whether you should use an Azure native or Azure non-native IaC tool. Some points to consider:Azure native tools like Azure CLI, ARM Templates, and Bicep are fully supported by Microsoft, which allows their new features to be integrated faster.Non-native tools like Terraform allow you to manage infrastructure as code across multiple cloud providers like AWS or GCP. However, new Azure features can take some time to be included in non-native. If your organization is multicloud or your organization is already using and well-versed in Terraform, consider using Terraform to deploy Azure landing zones.

Since modules enable you to break complex templates into smaller sets of code, consider using IaC modules for resources that are commonly deployed together. You can ensure each module focuses on a specific task and is reusable for multiple deployments and workloads.
