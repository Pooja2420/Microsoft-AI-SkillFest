Tutorial: Protect your public load balancer with Azure DDoS Protection

Azure DDoS Protection enables enhanced DDoS mitigation capabilities such as adaptive tuning, attack alert notifications, and monitoring to protect your public load balancers from large scale DDoS attacks.
Important
Azure DDoS Protection incurs a cost when you use the Network Protection SKU. Overages charges only apply if more than 100 public IPs are protected in the tenant. Ensure you delete the resources in this tutorial if you aren't using the resources in the future. For information about pricing, seeAzure DDoS Protection Pricing. For more information about Azure DDoS protection, seeWhat is Azure DDoS Protection?.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a DDoS Protection plan.
Create a virtual network with DDoS Protection and Bastion service enabled.
Create a standard SKU public load balancer with frontend IP, health probe, backend configuration, and load-balancing rule.
Create a NAT gateway for outbound internet access for the backend pool.
Create virtual machine, then install and configure IIS on the VMs to demonstrate the port forwarding and load-balancing rules.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.

Create the virtual network
In this section, you'll create a virtual network, subnet, Azure Bastion host, and associate the DDoS Protection plan. The virtual network and subnet contains the load balancer and virtual machines. The bastion host is used to securely manage the virtual machines and install IIS to test the load balancer. The DDoS Protection plan will protect all public IP resources in the virtual network.
Important
Hourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Create load balancer
In this section, you'll create a zone redundant load balancer that load balances virtual machines. With zone-redundancy, one or more availability zones can fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy.
During the creation of the load balancer, you'll configure:
Frontend IP address
Backend pool
Inbound load-balancing rules
Health probe

Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
