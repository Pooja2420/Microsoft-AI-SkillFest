Controlling outbound network access is an important part of an overall network security plan. For example, you may want to limit access to web sites. Or, you may want to limit the outbound IP addresses and ports that can be accessed.
One way you can control outbound network access from an Azure subnet is with Azure Firewall and Firewall Policy. With Azure Firewall and Firewall Policy, you can configure:
Application rules that define fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that can be accessed from a subnet.
Network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port, and destination address.
Network traffic is subjected to the configured firewall rules when you route your network traffic to the firewall as the subnet default gateway.
For this tutorial, you create a simplified single VNet with two subnets for easy deployment.
AzureFirewallSubnet- the firewall is in this subnet.
Workload-SN- the workload server is in this subnet. This subnet's network traffic goes through the firewall.

For production deployments, ahub and spoke modelis recommended, where the firewall is in its own VNet. The workload servers are in peered VNets in the same region with one or more subnets.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Set up a test network environment
Deploy a firewall and firewall policy
Create a default route
Configure an application rule to allow access towww.google.com
Configure a network rule to allow access to external DNS servers
Configure a NAT rule to allow a remote desktop to the test server
Test the firewall
If you prefer, you can complete this procedure usingAzure PowerShell.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Set up the network
First, create a resource group to contain the resources needed to deploy the firewall. Then create a VNet, subnets, and a test server.
Create a resource group
The resource group contains all the resources for the tutorial.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groupsor search for and selectResource groupsfrom any page, then selectCreate. Enter or select the following values:SettingValueSubscriptionSelect your Azure subscription.Resource groupEnterTest-FW-RG.RegionSelect a region. All other resources that you create must be in the same region.
On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groupsor search for and selectResource groupsfrom any page, then selectCreate. Enter or select the following values:

Change the primary and secondary DNS address for theSrv-Worknetwork interface
For testing purposes in this tutorial, configure the server's primary and secondary DNS addresses. This isn't a general Azure Firewall requirement.
On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groupsor search for and selectResource groupsfrom any page. Select theTest-FW-RGresource group.
Select the network interface for theSrv-Workvirtual machine.
UnderSettings, selectDNS servers.
UnderDNS servers, selectCustom.
Enter209.244.0.3in theAdd DNS servertext box, and209.244.0.4in the next text box.
SelectSave.
Restart theSrv-Workvirtual machine.
Test the firewall
Now, test the firewall to confirm that it works as expected.
Connect a remote desktop to firewall public IP address and sign in to theSrv-Workvirtual machine.

Browse tohttps://www.microsoft.com.
https://www.microsoft.com
You should be blocked by the firewall.
So now you've verified that the firewall rules are working:
You can browse to the one allowed FQDN, but not to any others.
You can resolve DNS names using the configured external DNS server.
Clean up resources
You can keep your firewall resources for the next tutorial, or if no longer needed, delete theTest-FW-RGresource group to delete all firewall-related resources.
