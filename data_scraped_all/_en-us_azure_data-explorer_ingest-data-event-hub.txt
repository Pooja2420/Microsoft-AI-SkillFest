Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion fromEvent Hubs, a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. Event Hubs can process millions of events per second in near real time.
In this article, you connect to an event hub and ingest data into Azure Data Explorer. For an overview on ingesting from Event Hubs, seeAzure Event Hubs data connection.
To learn how to create the connection using the Kusto SDKs, seeCreate an Event Hubs data connection with SDKs.
For code samples based on previous SDK versions, see thearchived article.
Create an event hub data connection
In this section, you establish a connection between the event hub and your Azure Data Explorer table. As long as this connection is in place, data is transmitted from the event hub into your target table. If the event hub is moved to a different resource or subscription, you need to update or recreate the connection.

Source
In theGet datawindow, theSourcetab is selected.
Select the data source from the available list. In this example, you're ingesting data fromEvent Hubs.

Configure
Select a target database and table. If you want to ingest data into a new table, select+ New tableand enter a table name.NoteTable names can be up to 1024 characters including spaces, alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores. Special characters aren't supported.

Fill in the following fields:SettingField descriptionSubscriptionThe subscription ID where the event hub resource is located.Event hub namespaceThe name that identifies your namespace.Event hubThe event hub you wish toConsumer groupThe consumer group defined in your eventData connection nameThe name that identifies your data connection.Advanced filtersCompressionThe compression type of the event hub messages payload.Event system propertiesTheevent hub system properties. If there are multiple records per event message, the system properties are added to the first one. When adding system properties,createorupdatetable schema andmappingto include the selected properties.Event retrieval start dateThe data connection retrieves existing Event Hubs events created after theEvent retrieval start date. Only events retained by Event Hubs's retention period can be retrieved. If theEvent retrieval start dateisn't specified, the default time is the time at which the data connection is created.

Inspect
TheInspecttab opens with a preview of the data.
To complete the ingestion process, selectFinish.

Optionally:
If the data you see in the preview window isn't complete, you might need more data to create a table with all necessary data fields. Use the following commands to fetch new data from your event hub:Discard and fetch new data: Discards the data presented and searches for new events.Fetch more data: Searches for more events in addition to the events already found.NoteTo see a preview of your data, your event hub must be sending events.

Edit columns
Note
For tabular formats (CSV, TSV, PSV), you can't map a column twice. To map to an existing column, first delete the new column.
You can't change an existing column type. If you try to map to a column having a different format, you may end up with empty columns.
The changes you can make in a table depend on the following parameters:
Tabletype is new or existing
Mappingtype is new or existing

Mapping transformations
Some data format mappings (Parquet, JSON, and Avro) support simple ingest-time transformations. To apply mapping transformations, create or update a column in theEdit columnswindow.
Mapping transformations can be performed on a column of type string or datetime, with the source having data type int or long. Supported mapping transformations are:
DateTimeFromUnixSeconds
DateTimeFromUnixMilliseconds
DateTimeFromUnixMicroseconds
DateTimeFromUnixNanoseconds
Advanced options based on data type
Tabular (CSV, TSV, PSV):
If you're ingesting tabular formats in anexisting table, you can selectAdvanced>Keep current table schema. Tabular data doesn't necessarily include the column names that are used to map source data to the existing columns. When this option is checked, mapping is done by-order, and the table schema remains the same. If this option is unchecked, new columns are created for incoming data, regardless of data structure.

Summary
In theData preparationwindow, all three steps are marked with green check marks when data ingestion finishes successfully. You can view the commands that were used for each step, or select a card to query, visualize, or drop the ingested data.
