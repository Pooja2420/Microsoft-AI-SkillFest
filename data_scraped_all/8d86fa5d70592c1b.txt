Security Copilot is a generative AI-powered security solution that helps increase the efficiency and capabilities of security personnel to improve security outcomes at machine speed and scale. It provides a natural language, assistive copilot experience helping support security professionals in end-to-end scenarios such as incident response, threat hunting, intelligence gathering, and posture management. For more information about what it can do, seeWhat is Microsoft Security Copilot?

Security Copilot integration in Azure Firewall
Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
The Azure Firewall integration in Security Copilot helps analysts perform detailed investigations of the malicious traffic intercepted by the IDPS feature of their firewalls across their entire fleet using natural language questions.
You can use this integration in two different experience:
Security Copilot portal(standalone experience)
Security Copilot portal(standalone experience)

Key features
Security Copilot has built-in system features that can get data from the different plugins that are turned on.
To view the list of built-in system capabilities for Azure Firewall, use the following procedure on the Security Copilot portal:
In the prompt bar, select thePromptsicon.

Enable the Azure Firewall integration in Security Copilot
Ensure your Azure Firewall is configured correctly:Azure Firewall Structured Logsâ the Azure Firewalls to be used with Security Copilot must be configured with resource specific structured logs for IDPS and these logs must be sent to a Log Analytics workspace.Role Based Access Control for Azure Firewallâ the users using the Azure Firewall plugin in Security Copilot must have the appropriate Azure Role-based access control roles to access the Firewall and associated Log Analytics workspaces.

Ensure that the Azure Firewall plugin is turned on. In the prompt bar, select theSourcesicon. In theManage sourcespop-up window that appears, confirm that theAzure Firewalltoggle is turned on. Then, close the window. No other configuration is necessary. As long as structured logs are being sent to a Log Analytics workspace and you have the right Role-based access control permissions, Copilot finds the data it needs to answer your questions.

Enter your prompt in the prompt bar on either theSecurity Copilot portalor via theCopilot in Azureexperience in the Azure portal.ImportantUse of Copilot in Azure to query Azure Firewall is included with Security Copilot and requiressecurity compute units (SCUs). You can deploy SCUs and increase or decrease them at any time. For more information on SCUs, seeGet started with Microsoft Security Copilot.
If you don't have Security Copilot properly configured but ask a question relevant to the Azure Firewall capabilities through the Copilot in Azure experience then you'll see an error message.

Sample Azure Firewall prompts
There are many prompts you can use to get information from Azure Firewall. This section lists the ones that work best today. They're continuously updated as new capabilities are launched.
Retrieve the top IDPS signature hits for a given Azure Firewall
Getlog informationabout the traffic intercepted by the IDPS feature instead of constructing KQL queries manually.

Sample prompts:
Has there been any malicious traffic intercepted by my Firewall<Firewall name>?
<Firewall name>
What are the top 20 IDPS hits from the last seven days for Firewall<Firewall name>in resource group<resource group name>?
<Firewall name>
<resource group name>
Show me in tabular form the top 50 attacks that targeted Firewall<Firewall name>in subscription<subscription name>in the past month.
<Firewall name>
<subscription name>
Enrich the threat profile of an IDPS signature beyond log information
Getadditional detailsto enrich the threat information/profile of an IDPS signature instead of compiling it yourself manually.

Sample prompts:
Explain why IDPS flagged the top hit as high severity and the fifth hit as low severity.
Explain why IDPS flagged the top hit as high severity and the fifth hit as low severity.
What can you tell me about this attack? What are the other attacks this attacker is known for?
What can you tell me about this attack? What are the other attacks this attacker is known for?
I see that the third signature ID is associated with CVE<CVE number\>, tell me more about this CVE.NoteThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence plugin is another source that Security Copilot might use to provide threat intelligence for IDPS signatures.

<CVE number\>
Note
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence plugin is another source that Security Copilot might use to provide threat intelligence for IDPS signatures.
Look for a given IDPS signature across your tenant, subscriptions, or resource groups
Perform afleet-wide search(over any scope) for a threat across all your Firewalls instead of searching for the threat manually.

Sample prompts:
Was signature ID<ID number\>only stopped by this one Firewall? What about others across this entire tenant?
<ID number\>
Was the top hit seen by any other Firewall in the subscription<subscription name>?
<subscription name>
Over the past week did any Firewall in resource group<resource group name\>see signature ID<ID number>?
<resource group name\>
<ID number>
Generate recommendations to secure your environment using Azure Firewall's IDPS feature
Getinformation from documentationabout using Azure Firewall's IDPS feature to secure your environment instead of having to look up this information manually.

Sample prompts:
How do I protect myself from future attacks from this attacker across my entire infrastructure?
How do I protect myself from future attacks from this attacker across my entire infrastructure?
If I want to make sure all my Azure Firewalls are protected against attacks from signature ID<ID number\>, how do I accomplish this?
If I want to make sure all my Azure Firewalls are protected against attacks from signature ID<ID number\>, how do I accomplish this?
<ID number\>
What is the difference in risk between alert only and alert and block modes for IDPS?NoteSecurity Copilot may also use theAsk Microsoft Documentationcapability to provide this information and when using this capability via the Copilot in Azure experience, theGet Informationcapability may be used to provide this information.

Through Copilot in Azure
Use thelikeanddislikebuttons at the bottom of each completed prompt. For either feedback option, you can provide additional information in the subsequent dialog box. Whenever possible, and especially when you dislike a response, write a few words explaining how the outcome can be improved. If you entered prompts specific to Azure Firewall and the results aren't related, include that information.
Privacy and data security in Security Copilot
When you interact with Security Copilot either through the Security Copilot portal or the Copilot in Azure experience to get information, Copilot pulls that data from Azure Firewall. The prompts, the data retrieved, and the output shown in the prompt results are processed and stored within the Copilot service.
