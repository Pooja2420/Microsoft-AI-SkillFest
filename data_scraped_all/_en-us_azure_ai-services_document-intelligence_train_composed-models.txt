The v4.02024-11-30(GA)model composeoperation adds an explicitly trained classifier instead of an implicit classifier for analysis. For the previous composed model version,seeComposed custom models v3.1. If you're currently using composed models, consider upgrading to the latest implementation.

What is a composed model?
With composed models, you can group multiple custom models into a composed model called with a single model ID. For example, your composed model might include custom models trained to analyze your supply, equipment, and furniture purchase orders. Instead of manually trying to select the appropriate model, you can use a composed model to determine the appropriate custom model for each analysis and extraction.
Some scenarios require classifying the document first and then analyzing the document with the model best suited to extract the fields from the model. Such scenarios can include ones where a user uploads a document but the document type isn't explicitly known. Another scenario can be when multiple documents are scanned together into a single file and the file is submitted for processing. Your application then needs to identify the component documents and select the best model for each document.
In previous versions, themodel composeoperation performed an implicit classification to decide which custom model best represents the submitted document. The2024-11-30 (GA)implementation of themodel composeoperation replaces the implicit classification from the earlier versions with an explicit classification step and adds conditional routing.

Benefits of the new model compose operation
The newmodel composeoperation requires you to train an explicit classifier and provides several benefits.
model compose
Continual incremental improvement. You can consistently improve the quality of the classifier by adding more samples andincrementally improving classification. This fine tuning ensures your documents are always routed to the right model for extraction.

Complete control over routing. By adding confidence-based routing, you provide a confidence threshold for the document type and the classification response.

Ignore document specific document types during the operation. Earlier implementations of themodel composeoperation selected the best analysis model for extraction based on the confidence score even if the highest confidence scores were relatively low. By providing a confidence threshold or explicitly not mapping a known document type from classification to an extraction model, you can ignore specific document types.

Analyze multiple instances of the same document type. When paired with thesplitModeoption of the classifier, themodel composeoperation can detect multiple instances of the same document in a file and split the file to process each document independently. UsingsplitModeenables the processing of multiple instances of a document in a single request.

How to use model compose
Start by collecting samples of all your needed documents including samples with information that should be extracted or ignored.

Train a classifier by organizing the documents in folders where the folder names are the document type you intend to use in your composed model definition.

Once your classification and extraction models are trained, use the Document Intelligence Studio, client libraries, or theREST APIto compose the classification and extraction models into a composed model.

Use thesplitModeparameter to control the file splitting behavior:
splitMode
None. The entire file is treated as a single document.
perPage. Each page in the file is treated as a separate document.
auto. The file is automatically split into documents.
Billing and pricing
Composed models are billed the same as individual custom models. The pricing is based on the number of pages analyzed by the downstream analysis model. Billing is based on the extraction price for the pages routed to an extraction model. With the addition of the explicit classification charges are incurred for the classification of all pages in the input file. For more information, see theDocument Intelligence pricing page.

Forcustom templatemodels, the composed model can be created using variations of a custom template or different form types. This operation is useful when incoming forms belong to one of several templates.

Forcustom neuralmodels the best practice is to add all the different variations of a single document type into a single training dataset and train on custom neural model. Themodel composeoperation is best suited for scenarios when you have documents of different types being submitted for analysis.

Compose model limits
With themodel composeoperation, you can assign up to 500 models to a single model ID. If the number of models that I want to compose exceeds the upper limit of a composed model, you can use one of these alternatives:Classify the documents before calling the custom model. You can use theRead modeland build a classification based on the extracted text from the documents and certain phrases by using sources like code, regular expressions, or search.If you want to extract the same fields from various structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents, consider using the deep-learningcustom neural model.

Analyzing a document by using composed models is identical to analyzing a document by using a single model. TheAnalyze Documentresult returns adocTypeproperty that indicates which of the component models you selected for analyzing the document.

To compose a model trained with a prior version of the API (v2.1 or earlier), train a model with the v3.0 API using the same labeled dataset. That addition ensures that the v2.1 model can be composed with other models.
