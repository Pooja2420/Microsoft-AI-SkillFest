In this guide, learn how to connect an Azure Monitor workspace to Grafana directly from an Azure Managed Grafana workspace. This feature is designed to provide a quick way to collect Prometheus metrics stored in an Azure Monitor workspace and enables you to monitor your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters in Grafana.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
An Azure Managed Grafana workspace in the Standard tier.Create a new workspaceif you don't have one.
AnAzure Monitor workspace with Prometheus data.
Add a new role assignment
In the Azure Monitor workspace, assign theMonitoring Data Readerrole to the Azure Managed Grafana resource's managed identity, so that Grafana can collect data from the Azure Monitor workspace.
Note
A system-assigned managed identity must be enabled in your Azure Managed Grafana resource. If needed, enable it by going toIdentityand selectStatus:On.
To assign the Monitoring Data Reader role:
Open the Azure Monitor workspace that holds Prometheus data.
Go toAccess control (IAM)>Add>Add role assignment.
Select theMonitoring Data Readerrole, thenNext.
ForAssign access to, selectManaged identity
OpenSelect membersand select your Azure Managed Grafana resource.
SelectReview + assignto initiate the role assignment
Add an Azure Monitor workspace
Open your Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
In the left menu, selectIntegrations>Azure Monitor workspaces.
SelectAdd.
In the pane that opens, select an Azure Monitor workspace from the list and confirm withAdd.
Once the operation is complete, Azure displays all the Azure Monitor workspaces added to the Azure Managed Grafana workspace. You can add more Azure Monitor workspaces by selectingAddagain.
Display Prometheus data in Grafana
When you added the Azure Monitor workspace to Azure Managed Grafana in the previous step, Azure added a new Prometheus data source to Grafana.
To get a dashboard with Prometheus metrics, either use one of the prebuilt dashboards or build a brand new one.
Use a prebuilt dashboard
In Grafana, go toDashboardsfrom the left menu and expand theManaged Prometheusdata source. Review the list of prebuilt dashboards and open one that seems interesting to you.
The following automatically generated dashboards are available, as of November 7, 2023:
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster (Windows)
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods)
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Windows)
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Workloads)
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Node (Pods)
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod (Windows)
Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Workload
Kubernetes / Kubelet
Kubernetes / Networking
Kubernetes / USE Method / Cluster (Windows)
Kubernetes / USE Method / Node (Windows)
Node Exporter / Nodes
Node Exporter / USE Method / Node
Overview
The following screenshot shows some of the panels from the "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster" dashboard.

Edit the dashboard as desired. For more information about editing a dashboard, readEdit a dashboard panel.
Create a new dashboard
To build a brand new dashboard with Prometheus metrics:
Open Grafana and selectConnections>Your connectionsfrom the left menu.
Open Grafana and selectConnections>Your connectionsfrom the left menu.
Find the new Prometheus data source.

Tip
If you're unable to get Prometheus data in your dashboard, check if your Azure Monitor workspace is collecting Prometheus data. Go toTroubleshoot collection of Prometheus metrics in Azure Monitorfor more information.
Remove an Azure Monitor workspace
If you no longer need it, you can remove an Azure Monitor workspace from your Azure Managed Grafana workspace:
In your Azure Managed Grafana workspace, selectIntegrations> **Azure Monitor workspaces from the left menu.
Select the row  with the resource to delete and selectDelete>Yes.
Optionally also remove the role assignment that was previously added in the Azure Monitor workspace:
In the Azure Monitor workspace resource, selectAccess control (IAM)>Role assignments.
UnderMonitoring Data Reader, select the row with the name of your Azure Managed Grafana resource and selectRemove>OK.
