Workloads commonly span multiple cloud platforms. Cloud security services must do the same. Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps protect workloads in Amazon Web Services (AWS), but you need to set up the connection between them and Defender for Cloud.
The following screenshot shows AWS accounts displayed in the Defender for Cloudoverview dashboard.

You can learn more by watching theNew AWS connector in Defender for Cloudvideo from theDefender for Cloud in the Fieldvideo series.
AWS authentication process
Federated authentication is used between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and AWS. All of the resources related to the authentication are created as a part of the CloudFormation template deployment, including:
An identity provider (OpenID connect)
An identity provider (OpenID connect)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with a federated principal (connected to the identity providers).
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with a federated principal (connected to the identity providers).
The architecture of the authentication process across clouds is as follows:

Microsoft Defender for Cloud CSPM service acquires a Microsoft Entra token with a validity life time of 1 hour that is signed by the Microsoft Entra ID using the RS256 algorithm.
The Microsoft Entra token is exchanged with AWS short living credentials and Defender for Cloud's CSPM service assumes the CSPM IAM role (assumed with web identity).
Since the principle of the role is a federated identity as defined in a trust relationship policy, the AWS identity provider validates the Microsoft Entra token against the Microsoft Entra ID through a process that includes:
audience validation
audience validation
token digital signature validation
token digital signature validation
certificate thumbprint
certificate thumbprint
The Microsoft Defender for Cloud CSPM role is assumed only after the validation conditions defined at the trust relationship have been met. The conditions defined for the role level are used for validation within AWS and allows only the Microsoft Defender for Cloud CSPM application (validated audience) access to the specific role (and not any other Microsoft token).
After the Microsoft Entra token is validated by the AWS identity provider, the AWS STS exchanges the token with AWS short-living credentials which the CSPM service uses to scan the AWS account.

Note
The AWS connector is not available on the national government clouds (Azure Government, Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet).
Native connector plan requirements
Each plan has its own requirements for the native connector.
Defender for Containers
If you choose the Microsoft Defender for Containers plan, you need:
At least one Amazon EKS cluster with permission to access to the EKS Kubernetes API server. If you need to create a new EKS cluster, follow the instructions inGetting started with Amazon EKS â eksctl.
The resource capacity to create a new Amazon SQS queue,Kinesis Data Firehosedelivery stream, and Amazon S3 bucket in the cluster's region.
Kinesis Data Firehose
Defender for SQL
If you choose the Microsoft Defender for SQL plan, you need:
Microsoft Defender for SQL enabled on your subscription.Learn how to protect your databases.
An active AWS account, with EC2 instances running SQL Server or RDS Custom for SQL Server.
Azure Arc for servers installed on your EC2 instances or RDS Custom for SQL Server.
We recommend that you use the autoprovisioning process to install Azure Arc on all of your existing and future EC2 instances. To enable the Azure Arc autoprovisioning, you needOwnerpermission on the relevant Azure subscription.
AWS Systems Manager (SSM) uses the SSM Agent to handle automatic provisioning. Some Amazon Machine Images already have theSSM Agent preinstalled. If your EC2 instances don't have the SSM Agent, install it by using these instructions from Amazon:Install SSM Agent for a hybrid and multicloud environment (Windows).
Ensure that your SSM Agent has the managed policyAmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore. It enables core functionality for the AWS Systems Manager service.
Enable these other extensions on the Azure Arc-connected machines:
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
A vulnerability assessment solution (TVM or Qualys)
The Log Analytics agent on Azure Arc-connected machines or the Azure Monitor agent
Make sure the selected Log Analytics workspace has a security solution installed. The Log Analytics agent and the Azure Monitor agent are currently configured at thesubscriptionlevel. All of your AWS accounts and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects under the same subscription inherit the subscription settings for the Log Analytics agent and the Azure Monitor agent.
Learn more about monitoring componentsfor Defender for Cloud.
Defender for open-source databases (Preview)
If you choose the Defender for open-source relational databases plan, you need:
You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you cansign up for a free subscription.
You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you cansign up for a free subscription.
You mustenable Microsoft Defender for Cloudon your Azure subscription.

Region availability: All public AWS regions (excluding Tel Aviv, Milan, Jakarta, Spain and Bahrain).
Defender for Servers
If you choose the Microsoft Defender for Servers plan, you need:
Microsoft Defender for Servers enabled on your subscription. Learn how to enable plans inEnable enhanced security features.
An active AWS account, with EC2 instances.
Azure Arc for servers installed on your EC2 instances.
We recommend that you use the autoprovisioning process to install Azure Arc on all of your existing and future EC2 instances. To enable the Azure Arc autoprovisioning, you needOwnerpermission on the relevant Azure subscription.
AWS Systems Manager automatically provisions using the SSM Agent. Some Amazon Machine Images already have theSSM Agent preinstalled. If your EC2 instances don't have the SSM Agent, install it by using either of the following instructions from Amazon:
Install SSM Agent for a hybrid and multicloud environment (Windows)
Install SSM Agent for a hybrid and multicloud environment (Linux)
Ensure that your SSM Agent has the managed policyAmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore, which enables core functionality for the AWS Systems Manager service.
You must have the SSM Agent for auto provisioning Arc agent on EC2 machines. If the SSM doesn't exist, or is removed from the EC2, the Arc provisioning won't be able to proceed.
Note
As part of the CloudFormation template that is run during the onboarding process, an automation process is created and triggered every 30 days, over all the EC2s that existed during the initial run of the CloudFormation. The goal of this scheduled scan is to ensure that all the relevant EC2s have an IAM profile with the required IAM policy that allows Defender for Cloud to access, manage, and provide the relevant security features (including the Arc agent provisioning). The scan does not apply to EC2s that were created after the run of the CloudFormation.
If you want to manually install Azure Arc on your existing and future EC2 instances, use theEC2 instances should be connected to Azure Arcrecommendation to identify instances that don't have Azure Arc installed.
Enable these other extensions on the Azure Arc-connected machines:
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Note
As the Log Analytics agent (also known as MMA) is set to retire inAugust 2024, all Defender for Servers features and security capabilities that currently depend on it, including those described on this page, will be available through eitherMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint integrationoragentless scanning, before the retirement date. For more information about the roadmap for each of the features that are currently rely on Log Analytics Agent, seethis announcement.
Defender for Servers assigns tags to your Azure ARC resources on top of your EC2 instances to manage the autoprovisioning process. You must have these tags properly assigned to your resources so that Defender for Cloud can manage them:AccountId,Cloud,InstanceId, andMDFCSecurityConnector.
AccountId
Cloud
InstanceId
MDFCSecurityConnector
Defender CSPM
If you choose the Microsoft Defender CSPM plan, you need:
a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you cansign up for a free subscription.
You mustenable Microsoft Defender for Cloudon your Azure subscription.
Connect yournon-Azure machinesand AWS accounts.
In order to gain access to all of the features available from the CSPM plan, the plan must be enabled by theSubscription Owner.
To enable CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) capabilities, the Entra ID account used for the onboarding process must have either the Application Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator directory role for your tenant (or equivalent administrator rights to create app registrations). This requirement is only necessary during the onboarding process.

Select Defender plans
In this section of the wizard, you select the Defender for Cloud plans that you want to enable.
SelectNext: Select plans.TheSelect planstab is where you choose which Defender for Cloud capabilities to enable for this AWS account. Each plan has its ownrequirements for permissionsand might incurcharges.ImportantTo present the current status of your recommendations, the Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management plan queries the AWS resource APIs several times a day. These read-only API calls incur no charges, but theyareregistered in CloudTrail if you've enabled a trail for read events.As explained inthe AWS documentation, there are no additional charges for keeping one trail. If you're exporting the data out of AWS (for example, to an external SIEM system), this increased volume of calls might also increase ingestion costs. In such cases, we recommend filtering out the read-only calls from the Defender for Cloud user or ARN role:arn:aws:iam::[accountId]:role/CspmMonitorAws. (This is the default role name. Confirm the role name configured on your account.)

Deploy a CloudFormation template to your AWS account
As part of connecting an AWS account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you deploy a CloudFormation template to the AWS account. This template creates all of the required resources for the connection.
Deploy the CloudFormation template by using Stack (or StackSet if you have a management account). When you're deploying the template, the Stack creation wizard offers the following options.

Amazon S3 URL: Upload the downloaded CloudFormation template to your own S3 bucket with your own security configurations. Enter the URL to the S3 bucket in the AWS deployment wizard.
Amazon S3 URL: Upload the downloaded CloudFormation template to your own S3 bucket with your own security configurations. Enter the URL to the S3 bucket in the AWS deployment wizard.
Upload a template file: AWS automatically creates an S3 bucket that the CloudFormation template is saved to. The automation for the S3 bucket has a security misconfiguration that causes theS3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layerrecommendation to appear.
