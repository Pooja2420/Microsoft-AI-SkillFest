In this article, you'll learn how to secure a linked service in Synapse with a private endpoint.
Prerequisites
Azure subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree Azure accountbefore you begin.
Azure Storage account: You use Azure Data Lake Gen 2 as asourcedata store. If you don't have a storage account, seeCreate an Azure Storage accountfor steps to create one. Make sure that the Storage Account has the Synapse Studio IP filtering for accessing it and that you only allowSelected networksto access the Storage account. The setting under the bladeFirewalls and virtual networksshould look like the picture below.

Create a linked service with Private Links
In Azure Synapse Analytics, a linked service is where you define your connection information to other services. In this section, you'll add Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Data Lake Gen 2 as linked services.
Open the Synapse Studio and go to theManagetab.
UnderExternal connections, selectLinked services.
To add a linked service, selectNew.
Select the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 tile from the list and selectContinue.
Make sure you enableInteractive Authoring. It might take around 1 minute to be enabled.
Enter your authentication credentials. Account key, service principal, and managed identity are currently supported authentication types. Select test connection to verify your credentials are correct.
SelectTest connection, it should fail because the Storage Account doesn't enable access into it without the creation and approval of a Private Endpoint. In the error message, you should see a link to create aprivate endpointthat you can follow to go to the next part. If you follow that link, skip the next part.
SelectCreatewhen finished.
Create a managed private endpoint
If you didn't select into the hyperlink when testing the connection above, follow the following path. Create a managed private endpoint that you'll connect to the linked service created above.
Go to theManagetab.
Go to theManaged Virtual Networkssection.
Select+ Newunder Managed private endpoint.
Select the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 tile from the list and selectContinue.
Enter the name of the Storage Account you created above.
SelectCreate
You should see after waiting some seconds that the private link created needs an approval.
Private link approval
Select the Private Endpoint that you created above. You can see a hyperlink that will let you approve the Private Endpoint at the Storage Account level.An alternative is to go directly to the Azure portal Storage Account and go into thePrivate endpoint connectionsblade.
Tick the Private endpoint you created in the Studio and selectApprove.
Add a description and selectyes
Go back to Synapse Studio in under theManaged Virtual Networkssection of theManagetab.
It should take around 1 minute to get the approval reflected for your private endpoint.
Check the connection works
Go to theManagetab and select the linked service you created.
Make sure thatInteractive authoringis active.
SelectTest connection. You should see the connection be successful.
You've now established a secure and private connection between Synapse and your linked service.
