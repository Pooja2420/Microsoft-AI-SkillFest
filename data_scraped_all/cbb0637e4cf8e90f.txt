This tutorial shows you how to use Virtual WAN to connect to your resources in Azure over an ExpressRoute circuit. For more conceptual information about ExpressRoute in Virtual WAN, seeAbout ExpressRoute in Virtual WAN. You can also create this configuration using thePowerShellsteps.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual WAN
Create a hub and a gateway
Connect a VNet to a hub
Connect a circuit to a hub gateway
Test connectivity
Change a gateway size
Advertise a default route
Prerequisites
Verify that you've met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:
You have a virtual network that you want to connect to. Verify that none of the subnets of your on-premises networks overlap with the virtual networks that you want to connect to. To create a virtual network in the Azure portal, see theQuickstart.
You have a virtual network that you want to connect to. Verify that none of the subnets of your on-premises networks overlap with the virtual networks that you want to connect to. To create a virtual network in the Azure portal, see theQuickstart.
Your virtual network doesn't have any virtual network gateways. If your virtual network has a gateway (either VPN or ExpressRoute), you must remove all gateways. This configuration requires that virtual networks are connected instead to the Virtual WAN hub gateway.

Obtain an IP address range for your hub region. The hub is a virtual network that is created and used by Virtual WAN. The address range that you specify for the hub can't overlap with any of your existing virtual networks that you connect to. It also can't overlap with your address ranges that you connect to on-premises. If you're unfamiliar with the IP address ranges located in your on-premises network configuration, coordinate with someone who can provide those details for you.

The following ExpressRoute circuit SKUs can be connected to the hub gateway: Local, Standard, and Premium.

Create a virtual hub and gateway
In this section, you'll create an ExpressRoute gateway for your virtual hub. You can either create the gateway when youcreate a new virtual hub, or you can create the gateway in anexisting hubby editing it.
To create a new virtual hub and a gateway
Create a new virtual hub. Once a hub is created, you'll be charged for the hub, even if you don't attach any sites.
Go to the virtual WAN that you created. On the virtual WAN page left pane, under theConnectivity, selectHubs.

The minimum address space is /24 to create a hub.Virtual hub capacity: Select from the dropdown. For more information, seeVirtual hub settings.Hub routing preference: Leave the setting as the default,ExpressRouteunless you have a specific need to change this field. For more information, seeVirtual hub routing preference.

To create a gateway in an existing hub
You can also create a gateway in an existing hub by editing the hub.
Go to the virtual WAN.
In the left pane, selectHubs.
On theVirtual WAN | Hubspage, click the hub that you want to edit.
On theVirtual HUBpage, at the top of the page, clickEdit virtual hub.
On theEdit virtual hubpage, select the checkboxInclude ExpressRoute gatewayand adjust any other settings that you require.
SelectConfirmto confirm your changes. It takes about 30 minutes for the hub and hub resources to fully create.
To view a gateway
Once you've created an ExpressRoute gateway, you can view gateway details. Navigate to the hub, selectExpressRoute, and view the gateway.

Connect your VNet to the hub
In this section, you create the peering connection between your hub and a VNet. Repeat these steps for each VNet that you want to connect.
On the page for your virtual WAN, clickVirtual network connection.
On the page for your virtual WAN, clickVirtual network connection.
On the virtual network connection page, click+Add connection.
On the virtual network connection page, click+Add connection.
On theAdd connectionpage, fill in the following fields:Connection name- Name your connection.Hubs- Select the hub you want to associate with this connection.Subscription- Verify the subscription.Virtual network- Select the virtual network you want to connect to this hub. The virtual network can't have an already existing virtual network gateway (neither VPN nor ExpressRoute).
On theAdd connectionpage, fill in the following fields:
Connection name- Name your connection.
Hubs- Select the hub you want to associate with this connection.
Subscription- Verify the subscription.
Virtual network- Select the virtual network you want to connect to this hub. The virtual network can't have an already existing virtual network gateway (neither VPN nor ExpressRoute).
Connect your circuit to the hub gateway
Once the gateway is created, you can connect anExpressRoute circuitto it.
To connect the circuit to the hub gateway
First, verify that your circuit's peering status is provisioned in theExpressRoute circuit -> Peeringspage in Portal. Then, go to theVirtual hub -> Connectivity -> ExpressRoutepage. If you have access in your subscription to an ExpressRoute circuit, you'll see the circuit you want to use in the list of circuits. If you donât see any circuits, but have been provided with an authorization key and peer circuit URI, you can redeem and connect a circuit. SeeTo connect by redeeming an authorization key.
Select the circuit.
SelectConnect circuit(s).
To connect by redeeming an authorization key
Use the authorization key and circuit URI you were provided in order to connect.
On the ExpressRoute page, click+Redeem authorization key
On the Redeem authorization key page, fill in the values.
SelectAddto add the key.
View the circuit. A redeemed circuit only shows the name (without the type, provider and other information) because it is in a different subscription than that of the user.
To test connectivity
After the circuit connection is established, the hub connection status will indicate 'this hub', implying the connection is established to the hub ExpressRoute gateway. Wait approximately 5 minutes before you test connectivity from a client behind your ExpressRoute circuit, for example, a VM in the VNet that you created earlier.
To change the size of a gateway
If you want to change the size of your ExpressRoute gateway, locate the ExpressRoute gateway inside the hub, and select the scale units from the dropdown. Save your change. It will take approximately 30 minutes to update the hub gateway.
To advertise default route 0.0.0.0/0 to endpoints
If you would like the Azure virtual hub to advertise the default route 0.0.0.0/0 to your ExpressRoute end points, you'll need to enable 'Propagate default route'.
Select yourCircuit ->â¦-> Edit connection.
Select yourCircuit ->â¦-> Edit connection.

SelectEnableto propagate the default route.
SelectEnableto propagate the default route.
To see your Virtual WAN connection from the ExpressRoute circuit blade
Navigate to theConnectionspage for your ExpressRoute circuit to see each ExpressRoute gateway that your ExpressRoute circuit is connected to. If the gateway is in a different subscription than the circuit, then thePeerfield will be the circuit authorization key.
Enable or disable VNet to Virtual WAN traffic over ExpressRoute
By default, VNet to Virtual WAN traffic is disabled over ExpressRoute. You can enable this connectivity by using the following steps.
In the "Edit virtual hub" blade, enableAllow traffic from non Virtual WAN networks.
In the "Virtual network gateway" blade, enableAllow traffic from remote Virtual WAN networks.See instructionshere.
We recommend that you keep these toggles disabled and instead create a Virtual Network connection between the standalone virtual network and Virtual WAN hub. This offers better performance and lower latency, as conveyed in ourFAQ.
Clean up resources
When you no longer need the resources that you created, delete them. Some of the Virtual WAN resources must be deleted in a certain order due to dependencies. Deleting can take about 30 minutes to complete.
Open the virtual WAN that you created.
