This article helps you connect virtual networks by using the VNet-to-VNet connection type. The virtual networks can be in the same or different regions, and from the same or different subscriptions. When you connect virtual networks from different subscriptions, the subscriptions don't need to be associated with the same tenant. If you already have VNets that you want to connect and they're in the same subscription, you might want to use theAzure portalsteps instead because the process is less complicated. Note that you can't connect VNets from different subscriptions using the Azure portal.
In this exercise, you create the required virtual networks (VNets) and VPN gateways. We have steps to connect VNets within the same subscription, as well as steps and commands for the more complicated scenario to connect VNets in different subscriptions. The PowerShell cmdlet to create a connection isNew-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection. The-ConnectionTypeisVnet2Vnet.

About connecting VNets
There are multiple ways to connect VNets. The following sections describe different ways to connect virtual networks.
VNet-to-VNet
Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating. The difference between the connection types is the way the local network gateway is configured. When you create a VNet-to-VNet connection, you don't see the local network gateway address space. It's automatically created and populated. If you update the address space for one VNet, the other VNet automatically knows to route to the updated address space. Creating a VNet-to-VNet connection is typically faster and easier than creating a Site-to-Site connection between VNets.
Site-to-Site (IPsec)
If you're working with a complicated network configuration, you might prefer to connect your VNets using theSite-to-Sitesteps, instead the VNet-to-VNet steps. When you use the Site-to-Site steps, you create and configure the local network gateways manually. The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic. If the address space for a VNet changes, you need to update the corresponding local network gateway to reflect the change. It doesn't automatically update.
VNet peering
You might want to consider connecting your VNets using VNet Peering. VNet peering doesn't use a VPN gateway and has different constraints. Additionally,VNet peering pricingis calculated differently thanVNet-to-VNet VPN Gateway pricing. For more information, seeVNet peering.
Why create a VNet-to-VNet connection?
You might want to connect virtual networks using a VNet-to-VNet connection for the following reasons:
Cross region geo-redundancy and geo-presenceYou can set up your own geo-replication or synchronization with secure connectivity without going over Internet-facing endpoints.With Azure Traffic Manager and Load Balancer, you can set up highly available workload with geo-redundancy across multiple Azure regions. One important example is to set up SQL Always On with Availability Groups spreading across multiple Azure regions.

Within the same region, you can set up multi-tier applications with multiple virtual networks connected together due to isolation or administrative requirements.
VNet-to-VNet communication can be combined with multi-site configurations. This lets you establish network topologies that combine cross-premises connectivity with inter-virtual network connectivity.
Which VNet-to-VNet steps should I use?
In this article, you see two different sets of steps. One set of steps forVNets that reside in the same subscriptionand one forVNets that reside in different subscriptions.
The key difference between the sets is that you must use separate PowerShell sessions when configuring the connections for VNets that reside in different subscriptions.
For this exercise, you can combine configurations, or just choose the one that you want to work with. All of the configurations use the VNet-to-VNet connection type. Network traffic flows between the VNets that are directly connected to each other. In this exercise, traffic from TestVNet4 doesn't route to TestVNet5.
VNets that reside in the same subscription: The steps for this configuration use TestVNet1 and TestVNet4.

VNets that reside in different subscriptions: The steps for this configuration use TestVNet1 and TestVNet5. If the virtual networks aren't in the same tenant, there areadditional instructionsthat you must follow. Read those instructions first to understand where they fall within the steps of the exercise.

How to connect VNets that are in the same subscription
You can complete the following steps using Azure Cloud Shell. If you would rather install latest version of the Azure PowerShell module locally, seeHow to install and configure Azure PowerShell.
Because it takes 45 minutes or more to create a gateway, Azure Cloud Shell times out periodically during this exercise. You can restart Cloud Shell by clicking in the upper left of the terminal. Be sure to redeclare any variables when you restart the terminal.
Step 1 - Plan your IP address ranges
In the following steps, you create two virtual networks along with their respective gateway subnets and configurations. You then create a VPN connection between the two VNets. Itâs important to plan the IP address ranges for your network configuration. Keep in mind that you must make sure that none of your VNet ranges or local network ranges overlap in any way. In these examples, we don't include a DNS server. If you want name resolution for your virtual networks, seeName resolution.
We use the following values in the examples:
Values for TestVNet1:
VNet Name: TestVNet1
Resource Group: TestRG1
Location: East US
TestVNet1: 10.1.0.0/16
FrontEnd: 10.1.0.0/24
GatewaySubnet: 10.1.255.0/27
GatewayName: VNet1GW
Public IP: VNet1GWIP
VPNType: RouteBased
Connection(1to4): VNet1toVNet4
Connection(1to5): VNet1toVNet5 (For VNets in different subscriptions)
ConnectionType: VNet2VNet
Values for TestVNet4:
VNet Name: TestVNet4
TestVNet2: 10.41.0.0/16
FrontEnd: 10.41.0.0/24
GatewaySubnet: 10.41.255.0/27
Resource Group: TestRG4
Location: West US
GatewayName: VNet4GW
Public IP: VNet4GWIP
VPNType: RouteBased
Connection: VNet4toVNet1
ConnectionType: VNet2VNet
Step 2 - Create and configure TestVNet1
For the following steps, you can either use Azure Cloud Shell, or you can run PowerShell locally. For more information, seeHow to install and configure Azure PowerShell.

Create the subnet configurations for TestVNet1. This example creates a virtual network named TestVNet1 and two subnets, one called GatewaySubnet, and one called FrontEnd. When substituting values, it's important that you always name your gateway subnet specifically GatewaySubnet. If you name it something else, your gateway creation fails. For this reason, it isn't assigned via variable in the example.The following example uses the variables that you set earlier. In this example, the gateway subnet is using a /27. While it's possible to create a gateway subnet using /28 for this configuration, we recommend that you create a larger subnet that includes more addresses by selecting at least /27. This will allow for enough addresses to accommodate possible additional configurations that you might want in the future.$fesub1 = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $FESubName1 -AddressPrefix $FESubPrefix1

After you finish the commands, it will take 45 minutes or more to create this gateway. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, you can restart your Cloud Shell session by clicking in the upper left of the Cloud Shell terminal, then configure TestVNet4. You don't need to wait until the TestVNet1 gateway completes.
Step 3: Create and configure TestVNet4
Create TestVNet4. Use the following steps, replacing the values with your own when needed.

$vnet4gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName4 -ResourceGroupName $RG4
Create the TestVNet1 to TestVNet4 connection. In this step, you create the connection from TestVNet1 to TestVNet4. You'll see a shared key referenced in the examples. You can use your own values for the shared key. The important thing is that the shared key must match for both connections. Creating a connection can take a short while to complete.New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $Connection14 -ResourceGroupName $RG1 `

How to connect VNets that are in different subscriptions
In this scenario, you connect TestVNet1 and TestVNet5. TestVNet1 and TestVNet5 reside in different subscriptions. The subscriptions don't need to be associated with the same tenant.
The difference between these steps and the previous set is that some of the configuration steps need to be performed in a separate PowerShell session in the context of the second subscription. Especially when the two subscriptions belong to different organizations.
Due to changing subscription context in this exercise, you might find it easier to use PowerShell locally on your computer, rather than using the Azure Cloud Shell, when you get to Step 8.
Step 5: Create and configure TestVNet1
You must completeStep 1andStep 2from the previous section to create and configure TestVNet1 and the VPN Gateway for TestVNet1. For this configuration, you aren't required to create TestVNet4 from the previous section, although if you do create it, it won't conflict with these steps. Once you complete Step 1 and Step 2, continue with Step 6 to create TestVNet5.
Step 6: Verify the IP address ranges
It's important to make sure that the IP address space of the new virtual network, TestVNet5, doesn't overlap with any of your VNet ranges or local network gateway ranges. In this example, the virtual networks might belong to different organizations. For this exercise, you can use the following values for the TestVNet5:
Values for TestVNet5:
VNet Name: TestVNet5
Resource Group: TestRG5
Location: Japan East
TestVNet5: 10.51.0.0/16
FrontEnd: 10.51.0.0/24
GatewaySubnet: 10.51.255.0.0/27
GatewayName: VNet5GW
Public IP: VNet5GWIP
VPNType: RouteBased
Connection: VNet5toVNet1
ConnectionType: VNet2VNet
Step 7: Create and configure TestVNet5
This step must be done in the context of the new subscription. This part might be performed by the administrator in a different organization that owns the subscription.
Declare your variables. Be sure to replace the values with the ones that you want to use for your configuration.$Sub5 = "Replace_With_the_New_Subscription_Name"

Step 8: Create the connections
In this example, because the gateways are in the different subscriptions, we've split this step into two PowerShell sessions marked as [Subscription 1] and [Subscription 5].
[Subscription 1]Get the virtual network gateway for Subscription 1. Sign in and connect to Subscription 1 before running the following example:$vnet1gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1Copy the output of the following elements and send these to the administrator of Subscription 5 via email or another method.$vnet1gw.Name
$vnet1gw.IdThese two elements will have values similar to the following example output:PS D:\> $vnet1gw.Name
VNet1GW
PS D:\> $vnet1gw.Id
/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroupsTestRG1/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet1GW
[Subscription 1]Get the virtual network gateway for Subscription 1. Sign in and connect to Subscription 1 before running the following example:
$vnet1gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
$vnet1gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
Copy the output of the following elements and send these to the administrator of Subscription 5 via email or another method.
$vnet1gw.Name
$vnet1gw.Id
$vnet1gw.Name
$vnet1gw.Id
These two elements will have values similar to the following example output:
PS D:\> $vnet1gw.Name
VNet1GW
PS D:\> $vnet1gw.Id
/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroupsTestRG1/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet1GW
PS D:\> $vnet1gw.Name

PS D:\> $vnet1gw.Id
/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroupsTestRG1/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet1GW
[Subscription 5]Get the virtual network gateway for Subscription 5. Sign in and connect to Subscription 5 before running the following example:$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName5 -ResourceGroupName $RG5Copy the output of the following elements and send these to the administrator of Subscription 1 via email or another method.$vnet5gw.Name
$vnet5gw.IdThese two elements will have values similar to the following example output:PS C:\> $vnet5gw.Name
VNet5GW
PS C:\> $vnet5gw.Id
/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/TestRG5/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet5GW
[Subscription 5]Get the virtual network gateway for Subscription 5. Sign in and connect to Subscription 5 before running the following example:
$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName5 -ResourceGroupName $RG5
$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName5 -ResourceGroupName $RG5
Copy the output of the following elements and send these to the administrator of Subscription 1 via email or another method.
$vnet5gw.Name
$vnet5gw.Id
$vnet5gw.Name
$vnet5gw.Id
These two elements will have values similar to the following example output:
PS C:\> $vnet5gw.Name
VNet5GW
PS C:\> $vnet5gw.Id
/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/TestRG5/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet5GW
PS C:\> $vnet5gw.Name

PS C:\> $vnet5gw.Id
/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/TestRG5/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet5GW
[Subscription 1]Create the TestVNet1 to TestVNet5 connection. In this step, you create the connection from TestVNet1 to TestVNet5. The difference here is that $vnet5gw can't be obtained directly because it is in a different subscription. You'll need to create a new PowerShell object with the values communicated from Subscription 1 in the previous steps. Use the following example. Replace the Name, ID, and shared key with your own values. The important thing is that the shared key must match for both connections. Creating a connection can take a short while to complete.Connect to Subscription 1 before running the following example:$vnet5gw = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models.PSVirtualNetworkGateway
$vnet5gw.Name = "VNet5GW"
$vnet5gw.Id   = "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/TestRG5/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VNet5GW"
$Connection15 = "VNet1toVNet5"

[Subscription 5]Create the TestVNet5 to TestVNet1 connection. This step is similar previous step, except you're creating the connection from TestVNet5 to TestVNet1. The same process of creating a PowerShell object based on the values obtained from Subscription 1 applies here as well. In this step, be sure that the shared keys match.Connect to Subscription 5 before running the following example:$vnet1gw = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models.PSVirtualNetworkGateway

Connect VNets in different subscriptions and different tenants
This scenario makes use of the previous scenario steps, but with a few key differences. In this scenario, TestVNet5 resides in Subscription 1, Tenant 1. TestVNet1 resides in Subscription2, Tenant 2.
In this scenario, when you create the TestVNet1 gateway, you need to connect to Tenant2, Subscription2 using the following commands. Adjust or declare any variables as needed.
Connect-AzAccount -TenantID $Tenant2
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscription2
<Other PS commandlets to create TestVNet1 gateway are same as above>
$vnet1gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
Connect-AzAccount -TenantID $Tenant2
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscription2
<Other PS commandlets to create TestVNet1 gateway are same as above>
$vnet1gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
When you create and configure TestVNet5 gateway, you need to connect to Tenant1, Subscription1 using the following commands, adjusting any variables as needed.
Connect-AzAccount -TenantID $Tenant1
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscription1
$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName5 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
Connect-AzAccount -TenantID $Tenant1
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscription1
$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName5 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
When you create create Vnet2Vnet VirtualNetworkGatewayConnection with VirtualNetworkGateway1 as $vnet1gw, you need to connect to Tenant2, Subscription2 first and other commands are same the previous section.
Connect-AzAccount -TenantID $Tenant2
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscription2
$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $Connection51 -ResourceGroupName $RG5 -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $vnet5gw -VirtualNetworkGateway2 $vnet1gw -Location $Location5 -ConnectionType Vnet2Vnet -SharedKey 'AzureA1b2C3'
Connect-AzAccount -TenantID $Tenant2
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscription2
$vnet5gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName1 -ResourceGroupName $RG1
New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $Connection51 -ResourceGroupName $RG5 -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $vnet5gw -VirtualNetworkGateway2 $vnet1gw -Location $Location5 -ConnectionType Vnet2Vnet -SharedKey 'AzureA1b2C3'
How to verify a connection
Important
NSGs on the gateway subnet aren't supported. Associating a network security group to this subnet might cause your virtual network gateway (VPN and ExpressRoute gateways) to stop functioning as expected. For more information about network security groups, seeWhat is a network security group?.
You can verify that your connection succeeded by using the 'Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection' cmdlet, with or without '-Debug'.
Use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values to match your own. If prompted, select 'A' in order to run 'All'. In the example, '-Name' refers to the name of the connection that you want to test.Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name VNet1toSite1 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
Use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values to match your own. If prompted, select 'A' in order to run 'All'. In the example, '-Name' refers to the name of the connection that you want to test.
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name VNet1toSite1 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name VNet1toSite1 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
After the cmdlet has finished, view the values. In the example below, the connection status shows as 'Connected' and you can see ingress and egress bytes."connectionStatus": "Connected",
"ingressBytesTransferred": 33509044,
"egressBytesTransferred": 4142431
