This article helps you understand managed identity (formerly known as Managed Service Identity/MSI) and how it works in Azure Data Factory.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Overview
Managed identities eliminate the need to manage credentials. Managed identities provide an identity for the service instance when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. For example, the service can use a managed identity to access resources likeAzure Key Vault, where data admins can securely store credentials or access storage accounts. The service uses the managed identity to obtain Microsoft Entra tokens.
There are two types of supported managed identities:
System-assigned:You can enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you allow a system-assigned managed identity during the creation of the service, an identity is created in Microsoft Entra tied to that service instance's lifecycle. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you.
User-assigned:You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You cancreate a user-assigned managed identityand assign it to one or more instances of a data factory. In user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.
Note
Trusted bypasscannot utilize user-assigned managed identities. It can only employ system-assigned managed identities for connecting to Azure Storage and Azure Key Vault.
Managed identity provides the below benefits:
Store credential in Azure Key Vault, in which case-managed identity is used for Azure Key Vault authentication.
Access data stores or computes using managed identity authentication, including Azure Blob storage, Azure Data Explorer, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Synapse Analytics, REST, Databricks activity, Web activity, and more. Check the connector and activity articles for details.
Managed identity is also used to encrypt/decrypt data and metadata using the customer-managed key stored in Azure Key Vault, providing double encryption.
Required Roles for Managed Identities
To effectively use managed identities in Azure Data Factory, specific roles must be assigned to ensure proper access and functionality. Below are the roles required:
System-Assigned Managed IdentityReader Role: This role is necessary to read the metadata of the resources.Contributor Role: This role is required to manage the resources that the managed identity needs to access.
System-Assigned Managed Identity
Reader Role: This role is necessary to read the metadata of the resources.
Contributor Role: This role is required to manage the resources that the managed identity needs to access.
User-Assigned Managed IdentityManaged Identity Operator Role: This role allows the management of the user-assigned managed identity.Reader Role: This role is necessary to read the metadata of the resources.Contributor Role: This role is required to manage the resources that the managed identity needs to access.
User-Assigned Managed Identity
Managed Identity Operator Role: This role allows the management of the user-assigned managed identity.
Reader Role: This role is necessary to read the metadata of the resources.
Contributor Role: This role is required to manage the resources that the managed identity needs to access.
System-assigned managed identity
Note
System-assigned managed identity is also referred to as 'Managed identity' elsewhere in the documentation and in the Data Factory Studio for backward compatibility purpose. We will explicitly mention 'User-assigned managed identity' when referring to it.
Generate system-assigned managed identity
System-assigned managed identity is generated as follows:
When creating a data factory throughAzure portal or PowerShell, managed identity will always be created automatically.
When creating data factory throughSDK, managed identity will be created only if you specify "Identity = new FactoryIdentity()" in the factory object for creation."  See example in.NET Quickstart - Create data factory.
When creating a data factory throughREST API, managed identity will be created only if you specify "identity" section in request body. See example inREST quickstart - create data factory.
If you find your service instance doesn't have a managed identity associated followingretrieve managed identityinstruction, you can explicitly generate one by updating it with identity initiator programmatically:
Generate managed identity using PowerShell
Generate managed identity using REST API
Generate managed identity using an Azure Resource Manager template
Generate managed identity using SDK
Note
Managed identity cannot be modified. Updating a service instance which already has a managed identity won't have any impact, and the managed identity is kept unchanged.
If you update a service instance which already has a managed identity without specifying the "identity" parameter in the factory objects or without specifying "identity" section in REST request body, you will get an error.
When you delete a service instance, the associated managed identity will also be deleted.
CallSet-AzDataFactoryV2command, then you see "Identity" fields being newly generated:
PS C:\> Set-AzDataFactoryV2 -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -Name <dataFactoryName> -Location <region>

DataFactoryName   : ADFV2DemoFactory
DataFactoryId     : /subscriptions/<subsID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/ADFV2DemoFactory
ResourceGroupName : <resourceGroupName>
Location          : East US
Tags              : {}
Identity          : Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataFactory.Models.FactoryIdentity
ProvisioningState : Succeeded
PS C:\> Set-AzDataFactoryV2 -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -Name <dataFactoryName> -Location <region>

DataFactoryName   : ADFV2DemoFactory
DataFactoryId     : /subscriptions/<subsID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/ADFV2DemoFactory
ResourceGroupName : <resourceGroupName>
Location          : East US
Tags              : {}
Identity          : Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataFactory.Models.FactoryIdentity
ProvisioningState : Succeeded
Note
If you attempt to update a service instance that already has a managed identity without either specifying theidentityparameter in the factory object or providing anidentitysection in the REST request body, you will get an error.
Call the API below with the "identity" section in the request body:

Call the create_or_update function with Identity=new FactoryIdentity(). Sample code using .NET:
Factory dataFactory = new Factory
{
    Location = <region>,
    Identity = new FactoryIdentity()
};
client.Factories.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroup, dataFactoryName, dataFactory);
Factory dataFactory = new Factory
{
    Location = <region>,
    Identity = new FactoryIdentity()
};
client.Factories.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroup, dataFactoryName, dataFactory);
Retrieve system-assigned managed identity
You can retrieve the managed identity from Azure portal or programmatically. The following sections show some samples.
Tip
If you don't see the managed identity,generate managed identityby updating your service instance.
You can find the managed identity information from Azure portal -> your data factory -> Properties.

Managed Identity Object ID
Managed Identity Tenant
The managed identity information will also show up when you create linked service, which supports managed identity authentication, like Azure Blob, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Key Vault, etc.
To grant permissions for the Data Factory manged identity to your Azure data sources, follow these steps. For detailed steps, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
SelectAccess control (IAM)on the Azure portal page for the data source.

Tip
To retrieve the managed identity from an ARM template, add anoutputssection in the ARM JSON:
{
    "outputs":{
        "managedIdentityObjectId":{
            "type":"string",
            "value":"[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.DataFactory/factories', parameters('<dataFactoryName>')), '2018-06-01', 'Full').identity.principalId]"
        }
    }
}
{
    "outputs":{
        "managedIdentityObjectId":{
            "type":"string",
            "value":"[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.DataFactory/factories', parameters('<dataFactoryName>')), '2018-06-01', 'Full').identity.principalId]"
        }
    }
}
User-assigned managed identity
You can create, delete, manage user-assigned managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID. For more details refer toCreate, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity using the Azure portal.
In order to use a user-assigned managed identity, you must firstcreate credentialsin your service instance for the UAMI.
