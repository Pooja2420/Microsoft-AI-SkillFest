After you create one or more Managed HSMs, you'll likely want to monitor how and when your HSMs are accessed, and by who. You can do this by enabling logging, which saves information in an Azure storage account that you provide. A new container namedinsights-logs-auditeventis automatically created for your specified storage account. You can use this same storage account for collecting logs for multiple Managed HSMs. You can also choose to send your logs to a log analytics workspace, which can then be used to enable Microsoft Sentinel to detect suspicious activity automatically.
You can access your logging information 10 minutes (at most) after the Managed HSM operation. In most cases, it is sooner. It's up to you to manage your logs in your storage account:
Use standard Azure access control methods to secure your logs by restricting who can access them.
Delete logs that you no longer want to keep in your storage account.
Use this tutorial to help you get started with Managed HSM logging. You should have a storage account or log analytics workspace already created before you enable logging and interpret the collected log information.
Prerequisites
To complete the steps in this article, you must have the following items:
A subscription to Microsoft Azure. If you don't have one, you can sign up for afree trial.
The Azure CLI version 2.25.0 or later. Runaz --versionto find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall the Azure CLI.
az --version
A managed HSM in your subscription. SeeQuickstart: Provision and activate a managed HSM using Azure CLIto provision and activate a managed HSM.

Identify the managed HSM, storage account, and log analytics workspace
The first step in setting up key logging is to find the Managed HSM that you want to log.
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Portal
Use the Azure CLIaz keyvault showcommand to find the Managed HSM that you want to log.
You can also use the Azure CLIaz storage account showcommand to find the storage account that you want to use for logging, and/or the Azure CLIaz monitor log-analytics workspace showcommand to find the log analytics workspace that you want to use for logging.
hsmresource=$(az keyvault show --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --query id -o tsv)
storageresource=$(az storage account show --name ContosoMHSMLogs --query id -o tsv)
loganalyticsresource=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show --resource-group ContosoResourceGroup --workspace-name ContosoLogs --query id -o tsv)
hsmresource=$(az keyvault show --hsm-name ContosoMHSM --query id -o tsv)
storageresource=$(az storage account show --name ContosoMHSMLogs --query id -o tsv)
loganalyticsresource=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show --resource-group ContosoResourceGroup --workspace-name ContosoLogs --query id -o tsv)
Use the Azure PowerShellGet-AzKeyVaultcmdlet to find the Managed HSM that you want to log.
Get-AzKeyVault
You can also use the Azure PowerShellGet-AzStorageAccountcmdlet to find the storage account that you want to use for logging, and/or the Azure PowerShellGet-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspacecmdlet to find the log analytics workspace that you want to use for logging.
Get-AzStorageAccount
Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace
$hsmresource = (Get-AzKeyVault -ResourceGroupName "ContosoResourceGroup" -VaultName "ContosoMHSM").ResourceId
$storageresource = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "ContosoResourceGroup" -Name "ContosoMHSMLogs").Id
$loganalyticsresource = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "ContosoResourceGroup" -Name "ContosoLogs").ResourceId
$hsmresource = (Get-AzKeyVault -ResourceGroupName "ContosoResourceGroup" -VaultName "ContosoMHSM").ResourceId
$storageresource = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "ContosoResourceGroup" -Name "ContosoMHSMLogs").Id
$loganalyticsresource = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "ContosoResourceGroup" -Name "ContosoLogs").ResourceId
Find your Managed HSM from the Azure portal landing page by clicking "See all" under "Resources" and selecting your Managed HSM by name. You can find your storage account and log analytics workspace in the same way.
Enable logging
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Portal
To enable logging for Managed HSM, use the Azure CLIaz monitor diagnostic-settings createcommand, together with the variables from the previous commands. We will also set the-Enabledflag to "true" and set thecategoryto "AuditEvent" (the only category for Managed HSM logging).
-Enabled
category
To send the logs to a storage account:
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics --resource $hsmresource --logs '[{"category": "AuditEvent","enabled": true}]' --storage-account $storageresource
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics --resource $hsmresource --logs '[{"category": "AuditEvent","enabled": true}]' --storage-account $storageresource
To send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace:
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name "ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics" --resource $hsmresource --logs '[{"category": "AuditEvent","enabled": true}]' --workspace $loganalyticsresource
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name "ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics" --resource $hsmresource --logs '[{"category": "AuditEvent","enabled": true}]' --workspace $loganalyticsresource
To enable logging for Managed HSM, use the Azure PowerShellSet-AzDiagnosticSettingcmdlet, together with the variables from the previous commands. We will also set the-Enabledflag to$trueand set thecategoryto "AuditEvent" (the only category for Managed HSM logging).
-Enabled
$true
category
To send the logs to a storage account:
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name "ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics" -ResourceId $hsmresource -Category "AuditEvent" -Enabled $true -StorageAccountId $storageresource
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name "ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics" -ResourceId $hsmresource -Category "AuditEvent" -Enabled $true -StorageAccountId $storageresource
To send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace:
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name "ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics" -ResourceId $hsmresource -Category "AuditEvent" -Enabled $true -WorkspaceId $loganalyticsresource
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -Name "ContosoMHSM-Diagnostics" -ResourceId $hsmresource -Category "AuditEvent" -Enabled $true -WorkspaceId $loganalyticsresource
Select your HSM resource in the Azure portal, and then select Diagnostic settings under Monitoring.

Select Add diagnostic setting.

Enter a Name for the diagnostic setting.

Select the category group of logs and/or metrics you want to send and the Destination details of the logs. In this example, we will select audit and allLogs as well as AllMetrics and send to a Log Analytics workspace. Enter the details for the destination, and select Save.

What's logged
The following types of operations and events are logged for Managed HSM:
All authenticated REST API requests, including failed requests as a result of access permissions, system errors, firewall blocks, or bad requests.
Managed plane operations on the Managed HSM resource itself, including creation, deletion, and updating attributes such as tags.
Security Domain related operations such as initialize & download, initialize recovery, upload
Full HSM backup, restore, and selective restore operations
Role management operations such as create/view/delete role assignments and create/view/delete custom role definitions
Operations on keys, including:Creating, modifying, or deleting the keys.Signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting, wrapping and unwrapping keys, listing keys.Key backup, restore, purgeKey release
Creating, modifying, or deleting the keys.
Signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting, wrapping and unwrapping keys, listing keys.
Key backup, restore, purge
Key release
Invalid paths that result in a 404 response.
Access your logs
Storage account
Managed HSM logs are stored in theinsights-logs-auditeventcontainer in the storage account that you provided. To view the logs, you have to download blobs. For information on Azure Storage, seeCreate, download, and list blobs with Azure CLI.
Individual blobs are stored as text, formatted as a JSON. Let's look at an example log entry. This example shows the log entry when a request to create a full backup is sent to the managed HSM.

Log Analytics workspace
Managed HSM logs are stored in the Log Analytics workspace that you provided. You can use the Azure portal to query the logs. For more information, seeLog Analytics tutorial.
Use Azure Monitor logs
You can use the Key Vault solution in Azure Monitor logs to review Managed HSM AuditEvent logs. In Azure Monitor logs, you use log queries to analyze data and get the information you need. For more information, including how to set it up, seeMonitor Azure Managed HSM.
For learn how to analyze logs, seeSample Kusto log queries.
If you are sending your logs to a log analytics workspace, you can use Microsoft Sentinel to automatically detect suspicious activity. SeeMicrosoft Sentinel for Azure Managed HSM.
