  displayName: string # Human-readable name for the task.
  target: string | target # Environment in which to run this task.
  enabled: boolean # Run this task when the job runs?
  env: # Variables to map into the process's environment.
    string: string # Name/value pairs

name
timeoutInMinutesstring.Time to wait for this task to complete before the server kills it. For example, to configure a 10 minute timeout, usetimeoutInMinutes: 10.
timeoutInMinutes
timeoutInMinutes: 10
Note
Pipelines may be configured with a job level timeout. If the job level timeout interval elapses before your step completes, the running job (including your step) is terminated, even if the step is configured with a longertimeoutInMinutesinterval. For more information, seeTimeouts.
timeoutInMinutes
retryCountOnTaskFailurestring.Number of retries if the task fails. On Azure DevOps Server 2022, 2022.1, and 2022.2, retries are supported only on agent jobs. For more information, seeAzure DevOps service update November 16, 2021 - Automatic retries for a taskandAzure DevOps service update June 14, 2025 - Retries for server tasks.

Remarks
Tasksare the building blocks of a pipeline.
There's acatalog of tasksavailable to choose from.
If you don't specify a command mode, you can shorten thetargetstructure to:
target
- task:
  target: string  # container name or the word 'host'
- task:
