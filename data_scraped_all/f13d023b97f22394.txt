Defender for Containers performs agentless vulnerability assessment on container images in supported runtime environments and supported container registries. Relevant recommendations are generated for vulnerabilities detected in a container registry image or running container.
Vulnerability assessment of images in supported container registries is performed whenRegistry accessis enabled for the Defender for Cloud Security Posture Management or Defender for Containers plans.
Vulnerability assessment of running container images is performed agnostic of the originating container registry, when theAgentless scanning for machinesextension together with either theK8S API accessorDefender sensorextensions are enabled in the Defender for Cloud Security Posture Management or the Defender for Containers plans. Vulnerability assessment findings are also created for container images pulled from supported registries.

Vulnerability assessment of container images, powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, has the following capabilities:
Scanning OS packages- container vulnerability assessment has the ability to scan vulnerabilities in packages installed by the OS package manager in Linux and Windows OS. See thefull list of the supported OS and their versions.

Vulnerability assessment recommendations
The following new preview recommendations report on runtime container vulnerabilities and registry image vulnerabilities, and don't count toward secure score while in preview.  The scan engine for the new recommendations is the same as the current GA recommendations, and provides the same findings. The new recommendations are best suited for customers that use the new risk-based view for recommendations and have the Defender CSPM plan enabled.

The following current GA recommendations report on vulnerabilities in containers within a Kubernetes cluster, and on container images within a container registry. These recommendations are best suited for customers that use the classic view for recommendations and don't have Defender CSPM plan enabled.

How Vulnerability Assessment for Images and Containers Works
Scanning images in Defender for Containers supported registries
Note
TheRegistry accessextension must be enabled for vulnerability assessment of images in container registries.
The scan of an image in a container registry creates an inventory of the image and its vulnerability recommendations. Thesupported container image registriesare: Azure Container Registry (ACR), Amazon AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Artifact Registry (GAR), Google Container Registry (GCR), andconfigured external registries. An image is scanned when:
A new image is pushed or imported to the container registry. The image is scanned within a few hours.
Continuous re-scan triggeringâ continuous rescan is required to ensure images that have been previously scanned for vulnerabilities are rescanned to update their vulnerability reports in case a new vulnerability is published.Re-scanis performed once a day for:Images pushed in the last 90 days.*Images pulled in the last 30 days.Images currently running on the Kubernetes clusters monitored by Defender for Cloud (either viaAgentless discovery for Kubernetesor theDefender sensor).*The newpreview recommendationis generated for images pushed in the last 30 days.

*The newpreview recommendationis generated for images pushed in the last 30 days.
Note
ForDefender for Container Registries (deprecated), images are scanned once on push, on pull, and rescanned only once a week.
Scanning containers running in the cluster workload
The container images in the cluster workload are scanned as follows:
Vulnerable images scanned in supported registries are identified as running on the cluster by discovery process. Running container images are scanned every 24 hours.Registry Accessand eitherKubernetes API accessorDefender sensormust be enabled.
Container images are collected from the runtime environment and scanned for vulnerabilities, agnostic to the originating registry. The scan includes customer owned containers, Kubernetes add-ons, and third party tools running on the cluster. Runtime environment images are collected every 24 hours.Agentless scanning for machineseitherKubernetes API accessorDefender sensormust be enabled.
Note
The container runtime layer can't be scanned for vulnerabilities.
Container images from nodes using AKS Ephemeral OS disks or Windows nodes can't be scanned for vulnerabilities.
Autoscale configured AKS clusters may provide partial or no results if any or all of the cluster nodes are down at the time of scan.
If I remove an image from my registry, how long before vulnerabilities reports on that image would be removed?
Azure Container Registries notifies Defender for Cloud when images are deleted, and removes the vulnerability assessment for deleted images within one hour. In some rare cases, Defender for Cloud might not be notified on the deletion, and deletion of associated vulnerabilities in such cases might take up to three days.
