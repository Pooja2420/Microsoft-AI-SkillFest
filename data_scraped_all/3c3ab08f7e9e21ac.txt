Deploying Azure API Management with Service Fabric is an advanced scenario.  API Management is useful when you need to publish APIs with a rich set of routing rules for your back-end Service Fabric services. Cloud applications typically need a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. In Service Fabric, a gateway can be any stateless service designed for traffic ingress such as an ASP.NET Core application, Event Hubs, IoT Hub, or Azure API Management.
This article shows you how to set upAzure API Managementwith Service Fabric to route traffic to a back-end service in Service Fabric.  When you're finished, you have deployed API Management to a VNET, configured an API operation to send traffic to back-end stateless services. To learn more about Azure API Management scenarios with Service Fabric, see theoverviewarticle.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Availability
Important
This feature is available in thePremiumandDevelopertiers of API Management due to the required virtual network support.
Prerequisites
Before you begin:
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree account
InstallAzure PowerShellorAzure CLI.
Create a secureWindows clusterin a network security group.
If you deploy a Windows cluster, set up a Windows development environment. InstallVisual Studio 2019and theAzure development,ASP.NET and web development, and.NET Core cross-platform developmentworkloads.  Then set up a.NET development environment.
Network topology
Now that you have a secureWindows clusteron Azure, deploy API Management to the virtual network (VNET) in the subnet and NSG designated for API Management. For this article, the API Management Resource Manager template is pre-configured to use the names of the VNET, subnet, and NSG that you set up in theWindows cluster tutorialThis article deploys the following topology to Azure in which API Management and Service Fabric are in subnets of the same Virtual Network:

Deploy a Service Fabric back-end service
Before configuring API Management to route traffic to a Service Fabric back-end service, first you need a running service to accept requests.
Create a basic stateless ASP.NET Core Reliable Service using the default Web API project template. This creates an HTTP endpoint for your service, which you expose through Azure API Management.
Start Visual Studio as Administrator and create an ASP.NET Core service:
In Visual Studio, select File -> New Project.
In Visual Studio, select File -> New Project.
Select the Service Fabric Application template under Cloud and name it"ApiApplication".
Select the Service Fabric Application template under Cloud and name it"ApiApplication".
Select the stateless ASP.NET Core service template and name the project"WebApiService".
Select the stateless ASP.NET Core service template and name the project"WebApiService".
Select the Web API ASP.NET Core 2.1 project template.
Select the Web API ASP.NET Core 2.1 project template.
Once the project is created, openPackageRoot\ServiceManifest.xmland remove thePortattribute from the endpoint resource configuration:<Resources>
  <Endpoints>
    <Endpoint Protocol="http" Name="ServiceEndpoint" Type="Input" />
  </Endpoints>
</Resources>Removing the port allows Service Fabric to specify a port dynamically from the application port range, opened through the Network Security Group in the Cluster Resource Manager template, allowing traffic to flow to it from API Management.
Once the project is created, openPackageRoot\ServiceManifest.xmland remove thePortattribute from the endpoint resource configuration:
PackageRoot\ServiceManifest.xml
Port
<Resources>
  <Endpoints>
    <Endpoint Protocol="http" Name="ServiceEndpoint" Type="Input" />
  </Endpoints>
</Resources>
<Resources>
  <Endpoints>
    <Endpoint Protocol="http" Name="ServiceEndpoint" Type="Input" />
  </Endpoints>
</Resources>
Removing the port allows Service Fabric to specify a port dynamically from the application port range, opened through the Network Security Group in the Cluster Resource Manager template, allowing traffic to flow to it from API Management.
Press F5 in Visual Studio to verify the web API is available locally.Open Service Fabric Explorer and drill down to a specific instance of the ASP.NET Core service to see the base address the service is listening on. Add/api/valuesto the base address and open it in a browser, which invokes the Get method on the ValuesController in the Web API template. It returns the default response that is provided by the template, a JSON array that contains two strings:["value1", "value2"]`This is the endpoint that you expose through API Management in Azure.

["value1", "value2"]`
This is the endpoint that you expose through API Management in Azure.
Finally, deploy the application to your cluster in Azure. In Visual Studio, right-click the Application project and selectPublish. Provide your cluster endpoint (for example,mycluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000) to deploy the application to your Service Fabric cluster in Azure.

mycluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000
An ASP.NET Core stateless service namedfabric:/ApiApplication/WebApiServiceshould now be running in your Service Fabric cluster in Azure.
fabric:/ApiApplication/WebApiService
Download and understand the Resource Manager templates
Download and save the following Resource Manager templates and parameters file:
network-apim.json
network-apim.parameters.json
apim.json
apim.parameters.json
Thenetwork-apim.jsontemplate deploys a new subnet and network security group in the virtual network where the Service Fabric cluster is deployed.
The following sections describe the resources being defined by theapim.jsontemplate. For more information, follow the links to the template reference documentation within each section. The configurable parameters defined in theapim.parameters.jsonparameters file are set later in this article.
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service
Microsoft.ApiManagement/servicedescribes the API Management service instance: name, SKU or tier, resource group location, publisher information, and virtual network.
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/certificates
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/certificatesconfigures API Management security. API Management must authenticate with your Service Fabric cluster for service discovery using a client certificate that has access to your cluster. This article uses the same certificate specified previously when creating theWindows cluster, which by default can be used to access your cluster.
This article uses the same certificate for client authentication and cluster node-to-node security. You may use a separate client certificate if you have one configured to access your Service Fabric cluster. Provide thename,password, anddata(base-64 encoded string) of the private key file (.pfx) of the cluster certificate that you specified when creating your Service Fabric cluster.
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/backends
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/backendsdescribes the  backend service that traffic is forwarded to.
For Service Fabric backends, the Service Fabric cluster is the backend instead of a specific Service Fabric service. This allows a single policy to route to more than one service in the cluster. Theurlfield here is a fully qualified service name of a service in your cluster that all requests are routed to by default if no service name is specified in a backend policy. You may use a fake service name, such as "fabric:/fake/service" if you do not intend to have a fallback service.resourceIdspecifies the cluster management endpoint.clientCertificateThumbprintandserverCertificateThumbprintsidentify certificates used to authenticate with the cluster.
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/products
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/productscreates a product. In Azure API Management, a product contains one or more APIs as well as a usage quota and the terms of use. Once a product is published, developers can subscribe to the product and begin to use the product's APIs.
Enter a descriptivedisplayNameanddescriptionfor the product. For this article, a subscription is required but subscription approval by an admin is not.  This productstateis "published" and is visible to subscribers.
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apiscreates an API. An API in API Management represents a set of operations that can be invoked by client applications. Once the operations are added, the API is added to a product and can be published. Once an API is published, it can be subscribed to and used by developers.
displayNamecan be any name for your API. For this article, use "Service Fabric App".
nameprovides a unique and descriptive name for the API, such as "service-fabric-app". It is displayed in the developer and publisher portals.
serviceUrlreferences the HTTP service implementing the API. API management forwards requests to this address. For Service Fabric backends, this URL value is not used. You can put any value here. For this article, for example "http://servicefabric".
pathis appended to the base URL for the API management service. The base URL is common for all APIs hosted by an API Management service instance. API Management distinguishes APIs by their suffix and therefore the suffix must be unique for every API for a given publisher.
protocolsdetermine which protocols can be used to access the API. For this article, listhttpandhttps.
pathis a suffix for the API. For this article, use "myapp".
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis/operations
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis/operationsBefore an API in API Management can be used, operations must be added to the API.  External clients use an operation to communicate with the ASP.NET Core stateless service running in the Service Fabric cluster.
To add a front-end API operation, fill out the values:
displayNameanddescriptiondescribe the operation. For this article, use "Values".
methodspecifies the HTTP verb.  For this article, specifyGET.
urlTemplateis appended to the base URL of the API and identifies a single HTTP operation.  For this article, use/api/valuesif you added the .NET backend service orgetMessageif you added the Java backend service.  By default, the URL path specified here is the URL path sent to the backend Service Fabric service. If you use the same URL path here that your service uses, such as "/api/values", then the operation works without further modification. You may also specify a URL path here that is different from the URL path used by your backend Service Fabric service, in which case you also need to specify a path rewrite in your operation policy later.
/api/values
getMessage
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis/policies
Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis/policiescreates a backend policy, which ties everything together. This is where you configure the backend Service Fabric service to which requests are routed. You can apply this policy to any API operation.  For more information, seePolicies overview.
Thebackend configuration for Service Fabricprovides the following request routing controls:
Service instance selection by specifying a Service Fabric service instance name, either hardcoded (for example,"fabric:/myapp/myservice") or generated from the HTTP request (for example,"fabric:/myapp/users/" + context.Request.MatchedParameters["name"]).
"fabric:/myapp/myservice"
"fabric:/myapp/users/" + context.Request.MatchedParameters["name"]
Partition resolution by generating a partition key using any Service Fabric partitioning scheme.
Replica selection for stateful services.
Resolution retry conditions that allow you to specify the conditions for re-resolving a service location and resending a request.
policyContentis the Json escaped XML contents of the policy.  For this article, create a backend policy to route requests directly to the .NET or Java stateless service deployed earlier. Add aset-backend-servicepolicy under inbound policies.  Replace thesf-service-instance-namevalue withfabric:/ApiApplication/WebApiServiceif you previously deployed the .NET backend service, orfabric:/EchoServerApplication/EchoServerServiceif you deployed the Java service.backend-idreferences a backend resource, in this case theMicrosoft.ApiManagement/service/backendsresource defined in theapim.jsontemplate.backend-idcan also reference another backend resource created using the API Management APIs.

Clean up resources
A cluster is made up of other Azure resources in addition to the cluster resource itself. The simplest way to delete the cluster and all the resources it consumes is to delete the resource group.
Sign in to Azure and select the subscription ID with which you want to remove the cluster.  You can find your subscription ID by logging in to theAzure portal. Delete the resource group and all the cluster resources using theRemove-AzResourceGroup cmdlet.
$ResourceGroupName = "sfclustertutorialgroup"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroupName -Force
$ResourceGroupName = "sfclustertutorialgroup"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroupName -Force
ResourceGroupName="sfclustertutorialgroup"
az group delete --name $ResourceGroupName
ResourceGroupName="sfclustertutorialgroup"
az group delete --name $ResourceGroupName
