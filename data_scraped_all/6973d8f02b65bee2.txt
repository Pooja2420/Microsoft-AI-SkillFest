This article provides details on ExpressRoute connections in Azure Virtual WAN.
A virtual hub can contain gateways for site-to-site, ExpressRoute, or point-to-site functionality. Users using private connectivity in Virtual WAN can connect their ExpressRoute circuits to an ExpressRoute gateway in a Virtual WAN hub. For a tutorial on connecting an ExpressRoute circuit to an Azure Virtual WAN hub, seeHow to Connect an ExpressRoute Circuit to Virtual WAN.
ExpressRoute circuit SKUs supported in Virtual WAN
The following ExpressRoute circuit SKUs can be connected to the hub gateway: Local, Standard, and Premium. ExpressRoute Direct circuits are also supported with Virtual WAN. To learn more about different SKUs, visitExpressRoute Circuit SKUs. ExpressRoute Local circuits can only be connected to ExpressRoute gateways in the same region, but they can still access resources in spoke virtual networks located in other regions.
ExpressRoute gateway performance
ExpressRoute gateways are provisioned in units of 2 Gbps. One scale unit = 2 Gbps with support up to 10 scale units = 20 Gbps.
It is important to note the following:
Scale units 2-10, during maintenance operations, maintain aggregate throughput. However, scale unit 1, during a maintenance operation, may see a slight variation in throughput numbers.
Regardless of the number of scale units deployed, traffic may experience performance degradation if more than 1.5 Gbps is sent in a single TCP flow.
BGP with ExpressRoute in Virtual WAN
Dynamic routing (BGP) is supported. For more information, please seeDynamic Route Exchange with ExpressRoute. The ASN of the ExpressRoute gateway in the hub and ExpressRoute circuit are fixed and can't be edited at this time.

Note
If you have configured a 0.0.0.0/0 route statically in a virtual hub route table or dynamically via a network virtual appliance for traffic inspection, that traffic will bypass inspection when destined for Azure Storage and is in the same region as the ExpressRoute gateway in the virtual hub. As a workaround, you can either usePrivate Linkto access Azure Storage or put the Azure Storage service in a different region than the virtual hub.
ExpressRoute limits in Virtual WAN
The above two limits hold true regardless of the number of ExpressRoute gateway scale units deployed. For ExpressRoute circuit route limits, please seeExpressRoute Circuit Route Advertisement Limits.
