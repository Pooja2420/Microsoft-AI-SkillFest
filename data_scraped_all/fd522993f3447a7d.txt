Inputs
azureSubscription-Azure subscriptionstring. Required.
azureSubscription
string
Selects theAzure Resource Manager subscriptionfor the deployment.
appName-App namestring. Required.
appName
string
The name of the Function App for Containers.
deployToSlotOrASE-Deploy to Slot or App Service Environmentboolean. Default value:false.
deployToSlotOrASE
boolean
false
Set this input totrueto deploy to an existing deployment slot or Azure App Service Environment. The task needs a Resource Group name for both targets. For the deployment slot option, the default deploys to theproductionslot, or you can specify any other existing slot name. If the deployment target is an Azure App Service Environment, leave the slot name asproductionand specify the Resource Group name.
true
resourceGroupName-Resource groupstring. Required whendeployToSlotOrASE = true.
resourceGroupName
string
deployToSlotOrASE = true
The name of the Resource Group that contains the Function App for Containers.
slotName-Slotstring. Required whendeployToSlotOrASE = true. Default value:production.
slotName
string
deployToSlotOrASE = true
production
Enters or selects an existing slot, excluding theproductionslot.
imageName-Image namestring. Required.
imageName
string
A globally unique top-level domain name for your specific registry or namespace.
Note:A fully qualified image name will be of the format:<registry or namespace> <repository> <tag>. For example,myregistry.azurecr.io/nginx:latest.
<registry or namespace> <repository> <tag>
myregistry.azurecr.io/nginx:latest
containerCommand-Startup commandstring.
containerCommand
string
The startup command that executes after deployment. For example,dotnet rundotnet filename.dll.
dotnet run
dotnet filename.dll.
appSettings-App settingsstring.
appSettings
string
Enter the application settings using the syntax-key value(for example:-Port 5000-RequestTimeout 5000-WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE). Enclose values that contain spaces in double quotes (for example:"Eastern Standard Time").
-key value
-Port 5000
-RequestTimeout 5000
-WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE
"Eastern Standard Time"
configurationStrings-Configuration settingsstring.
configurationStrings

Task control options
All tasks have control options in addition to their task inputs. For more information, seeControl options and common task properties.
Output variables
This task defines the followingoutput variables, which you can consume in downstream steps, jobs, and stages.
AppServiceApplicationUrlThe application URL of the selected App Service.
AppServiceApplicationUrl
Remarks
Use this task to deploy an Azure Function on Linux using acustom image.
Error: Could not fetch access token for Azure. Verify if the Service Principal used is valid and not expired.
The task uses the service principal in the service connection to authenticate with Azure. If the service principal has expired or doesn't have permissions to the App Service, the task fails with this error. Verify the validity of the service principal used and that it's present in the app registration. For more information, seeUse role-based access control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources.This blog postalso contains more information about using service principal authentication.
SSL error
If you want to use a certificate in App Service, the certificate must be signed by a trusted certificate authority. If your web app gives you certificate validation errors, you're probably using a self-signed certificate. Set a variable namedVSTS_ARM_REST_IGNORE_SSL_ERRORSto the valuetruein the build or release pipeline to resolve the error.
VSTS_ARM_REST_IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS
true
A release hangs for long time and then fails
This problem could be the result of insufficient capacity in your App Service plan. To resolve this problem, you can scale up the App Service instance to increase available CPU, RAM, and disk space or try with a different App Service plan.
5xxerror codes
If you're seeing a 5xxerror,check the status of your Azure service.
Azure Function suddenly stopped working
Azure Functions may suddenly stop working if more than one year has passed since the last deployment. If you deploy with "RunFromPackage" in "deploymentMethod", a SAS with an expiration date of 1 year is generated and set as the value of "WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE" in the application configuration. Azure Functions uses this SAS to reference the package file for function execution, so if the SAS has expired, the function will not be executed. To resolve this issue, deploy again to generate a SAS with an expiration date of one year.
How should I configure my service connection?
This task requires anAzure Resource Manager service connection.
How should I configure web job deployment with Application Insights?
When you're deploying to an App Service, if you haveApplication Insightsconfigured and you've enabledRemove additional files at destination, you also need to enableExclude files from the App_Data folder. Enabling this option keeps the Application Insights extension in a safe state. This step is required because the Application Insights continuous WebJob is installed into the App_Data folder.
Remove additional files at destination
Exclude files from the App_Data folder
How should I configure my agent if it's behind a proxy while I'm deploying to App Service?
If your self-hosted agent requires a web proxy, you can inform the agent about the proxy during configuration. Doing so allows your agent to connect to Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server through the proxy.Learn more about running a self-hosted agent behind a web proxy.
Examples
