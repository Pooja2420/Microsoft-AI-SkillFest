When you commit to a reserved instance of Azure Dedicated Hosts, you can save money. The reservation discount is applied automatically to the number of running dedicated hosts that match the reservation scope and attributes. You don't need to assign a reservation to a dedicated host to get the discounts. A reserved instance purchase covers only the compute part of your usage and does
include software licensing costs. See theOverview of Azure Dedicated Hosts for virtual machines.
Determine the right dedicated host SKU before you buy
Before you buy a reservation, you should determine which dedicated host you need. A SKU is defined for a dedicated host representing the VM series and type.
Start by going over the supported sizes forWindows virtual machineorLinuxto identify the VM series.
Next, check whether it is supported on Azure Dedicated Hosts.Azure Dedicated Hosts pricingpage has the complete list of dedicated hosts SKUs, their CPU information, and various pricing options (including reserved instances).
You may find several SKUs supporting your selected VM series (with different Types). Identify the best SKU by comparing the capacity of the host (number of vCPUs). Note that you will be able to apply your reservation to multiple dedicated hosts SKUs supporting the same VM series (for example DSv3_Type1 and DSv3_Type2) but not across different VM series (like DSv3 and ESv3).  Over the lifetime of the reservation, you may need to switch between different dedicated host SKUs that support the same VM size, depending on the hardware usage fluctuations and lifecycle.
Purchase restriction considerations
Reserved instances are available for most dedicated host sizes, with some exceptions.
Reservation discounts don't apply for the following:
Clouds- Reservations aren't available for purchase in Germany or China regions.

Insufficient quota- A reservation that is scoped to a single subscription must have vCPU quota available in the subscription for the new reserved instance. For example, if the target subscription has a quota limit of 10 vCPUs for DSv3-Series, then you can't buy a reservation dedicated hosts supporting this series. The quota check for reservations includes the VMs and dedicated hosts already deployed in the subscription. You cancreate quota increase requestto resolve this issue.

Capacity restrictions- In rare circumstances, Azure limits the purchase of new reservations for subset of dedicated host SKUs, because of low capacity in a region.

Usage data and reservation utilization
Your usage data has an effective price of zero for the usage that gets a reservation discount. You can see which VM instance received the reservation discount for each reservation.
For more information about how reservation discounts appear in usage data, seeUnderstand Azure reservation usage for your Enterprise enrollmentif you are an EA customer. If you have an individual subscription, seeUnderstand Azure reservation usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
