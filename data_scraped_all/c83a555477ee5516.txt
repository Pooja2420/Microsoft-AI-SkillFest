The Memory-and-storage optimized Mbv3 VM (Mbsv3 and Mbdsv3) series are based on the 4th generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Scalable processors and deliver higher remote disk storage performance. These new VM sizes offer up to 650,000 IOPS and 10 GBps of remote disk storage throughput Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disk, up to 4 TiB of RAM and up to 650,000 IOPS and 10 GBps throughput to remote disk storage with NVMe interface by using Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2.
The increased remote storage performance of these VMs is ideal for storage throughput-intensive workloads such as relational databases and data analytics applications.
The resource allocation and high-performance capabilities of the Mbv3 VM series make them particularly well suited for SQL Server workloads with high memory needs, such as criticalonline transaction processing (OLTP),data analytics,in-memory databases,data warehousing, and the consolidation of SQL Server workloads for efficient management of multiple SQL Server instances.

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3), remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
IOPS/MBps listed here refer to uncached mode for data disks.
To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, seeVirtual machine and disk performance.
IOPS spec is defined using common small random block sizes like 4KiB or 8KiB. Maximum IOPS is defined as "up-to" and measured using 4KiB random reads workloads.
TPUT spec is defined using common large sequential block sizes like 128KiB or 1024KiB. Maximum TPUT is defined as "up-to" and measured using 128KiB sequential reads workloads.
