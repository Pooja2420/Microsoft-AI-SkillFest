With Power BI Desktop, you can easily connect to an Analytics view to start creating reports for your project in Azure DevOps. An Analytics view provides a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data.
Important
Analytics views only support Azure Boards data (work items). Analytics views don't support other data types, such as pipelines. Views provide a flat list of work items and don't support work item hierarchies. At this point, there are no plans to update the connector to support other types of data. For information on other approaches, seeAbout Power BI integration.
If you don't have Power BI Desktop, you candownloadand install it for free.
You can create status and trend reports of your work tracking data using one of the default Analytics views available to you. As needed, you can alsocreate a custom Analytics view.
Follow these steps to create two reports in Power BI desktop that shows adaily trend of backlog itemsand acount of active user storiesbased on a defaultAnalytics view:
From the web portal for Azure DevOps:a. OpenAnalytics viewb. Verify a default Analytics view for your data.
From the Power BI Desktop:a. Get the dataset defined by the Analytics viewb. Create a trend reportc. Apply filters to your trend reportd. Create a card and apply theIs Current=Truefilter to show current count.
Prerequisites

Open Analytics to access views
From your web portal, selectBoards>Analytics views.
If you don't seeAnalytics views, check that you have permissions to view Analytics. See thePermissions and prerequisites to access Analytics.

Verify the default Analytics view for your data
By verifying the view you'll use in Power BI, your view is more likely to load correctly in Power BI. If verification takes too long, you can quickly adjust the view. Add filters or narrow your history and verify your view again.
From theAnalytics view>Allpage, choose theactions icon next to the default view and select theEditoption. For a project that uses the Agile process, use theStories -Last 30 daysview.

Choose theVerificationtab and then theVerify viewbutton.Wait until the verification process completes. Verification time varies according to the amount of data defined in your view. For example, a view that includes all work item types and specifies "All history", will take more time to verify than a view that includes only stories and specifies a rolling period of 30 days.

If your view successfully verifies, then go to the next step. If it's unsuccessful, select theWork Itemstab and adjust the selections to select fewer teams or specify fewer work items in the dataset.For more information about defining views, seeCreate an Analytics view.

Connect to an Analytics view
Follow these steps to connect to an Analytics view:
Open Power BI Desktop.
Open Power BI Desktop.
Sign in to the service. First-time access requires you to sign in and authenticate your credentials. Power BI Desktop saves your credentials, so you only have to sign in once.NoteAzure DevOps doesn't support cross-tenant scenarios that use Open Authorization (OAuth). Instead,use service principals and managed identities.

SelectConnect.
SelectConnect.

SelectGet Data>Online Services, and then selectAzure DevOps (Boards only)for cloud services orAzure DevOps Server (Boards only)for an on-premises server. SelectConnect. Analytics views support queries only against work items and test cases.

Specify the basic parameters to connect to your data.Collection URL: Enter the URL where your Azure DevOps Server instance is hosted. An example URL ishttps://fabrikam-server/AzureDevOpsServer/fabrikam-collection.Team project: Enter only the project name. For example, enterFabrikam-Fiberif the URL of your Azure DevOps Server instance ishttps://fabrikam-server/AzureDevOpsServer/fabrikam-collection/Fabrikam-Fiber.ImportantDon't confuse the team name with the project name, which is a common mistake. For example, if the URL you use ishttps://fabrikam-server/AzureDevOpsServer/fabrikam-collection/Fabrikam-Fiber-Git/Device,Fabrikam-Fiber-Gitis the project name, andDeviceis the team name.After you successfully sign in, Power BI verifies that your credentials have the permissions that are needed to access the specified project. If any errors arise, see theFAQsfor solutions to common problems.

Select the Analytics view
Follow these steps to select the Analytics view:
ExpandShared Views. The Data Connector presents a list of availableAnalytics views. Each view represents a set of data that you can pull into Power BI. You can alsocreate custom Analytics views.The following image shows the default Analytics views. Your list of views might differ based on the process model used to create your project. All views listed, except the views appended withToday, provide historical trend data.

Select theWork Items - Last 30 daysview and wait for the preview to load. This view uses a filter to show the last 30 days of history for all work items in the project.NoteIf you verify the view when you create it, the view should load. If the view doesn't load, it's most likely because the dataset is too large. Return to theAnalytics viewspage in the web portal and open the view for editing. Adjust the filters to decrease the size of the dataset.NoteThe preview shown for any selected view in the navigator can be truncated depending on the number of fields selected and the size of the dataset. The data gets truncated only for the preview and doesn't affect the full data refresh.Analytics viewsdon't apply filters defined by using Power BI on the server. Any filters applied in Power BI limit the data shown to end users but don't reduce the amount of data retrieved from Analytics. If the filter is intended to reduce the size of the dataset, apply it bycustomizing the view.

Select theWork Items - Todayview, which represents the current state of all work items in the project. Select the checkbox next to the view, and then selectLoad. Wait for the data to load. Monitor its progress through the status messages displayed under the table name. If any errors occur, refer to theFAQssection for solutions to common issues.

Create a daily trend report
In your report, (1) select the Line chart visual, (2) enterwork item idin the search field, and then (3) check the box forWork Item Id.It will change your chart to a single dot.TipTo change the chart size, choose theViewtab,Page View, and then select theAdjust Sizeoption as shown. You can then resize the chart to your desired dimensions.

Next, (1) select theDatefield in the fields list as your axis. By default, Power BI creates a date hierarchy from any date field. To see a daily trend, (2) select the context menu icon next to the field and change it fromDate HierarchytoDate.NoteTo view trends over time, you want to use theDateformat and notDate Hierarchy. TheDate Hierarchyin Power BI rolls ups everything into a simple number for the period. The day level in the hierarchy rolls all days to a number between 1-31. For example, April 3 and May 3 both roll up into number 3. This is not the same as counting items per actual date.

Group and filter the trend by State
To group your user stories by State, drag theStatefield into the Legend area. Optionally, filter the set of States to show in the chart.Here we've filtered the list to show work items in the Active, Committed, and In Progress states.The chart now shows a daily distinct count of user stories, grouped by Active, Committed, and In Progress.TipIf you need to modify your Analytics view, you can do so and then return to your Power BI report and refresh the data. Simply click theRefreshoption as shown.

Create a card to show the latest active stories count
Add a new page by clicking the plus sign (+) at the bottom of the page.

Select the card visual, add theWork Item Idfield, and then drag theStateandWork Item Typefields under Page level filters. Filter the State to show Active, and filter the Work Item Type for Bugs.The card now shows the number of active stories times the number of days each one was defined during the past 60 days. For this example, that number is 894.
