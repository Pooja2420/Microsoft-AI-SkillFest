After you've addedfeatures or epicsto your portfolio backlog, organize your backlog by mapping backlog items. You can quickly add and group items into a hierarchy. And also drill up or down within the hierarchy, reorder and reparent items, and filter hierarchical views.
In this article you'll learn how to:
Open your product backlog or portfolio backlog
View the tree hierarchy
Group backlog items using the Mapping pane
Reparent items through dragging or theChange parentoption
Note
For more information, seeBacklogs, boards, and plans. In case you don't see the desired work items on your backlog or board, seeSet up your backlogs and boards.
Prerequisites
Note
Stakeholderaccess users for a private project can't drag items to map or reparent them or to assign their sprint.

Open your backlog from the web portal
From your web browser, open your product backlog.
(1) Check that you've selected the right project, (2) chooseBoards>Backlogs, and then (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu.To select another backlog, open the selector and then choose a different team or select theView Backlog directoryoption. Or, enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.TipChoose thestar icon to favorite a team backlog.

Show parent tasks and expand the tree hierarchy
You can set various options to view backlog work items using theView optionsmenu. To learn which options to set based on the tasks you want to accomplish, seeConfigure your backlog view.
To view Parents or a tree hierarchy, choose theview options icon and slideParentstoOn.The hierarchical view displays. From this view, you can reparent items by dragging a child item to a new parent.

Map items to group them under a feature or epic
If you've already created your backlog, and now you want to organize it, you can do that most easily by mapping child items to parents.
ChooseView optionsand selectMapping.The Mapping pane displays immediately.

To map features to epics, select theFeaturesbacklog from the backlog selector. The Epics Mapping pane automatically displays.

You can multi-select backlog and sprint backlog items in the same way as youmulti-select items from query results.
It's the same process to map features to epics. From the Features backlog, drag features to an epic listed under the mapping pane.

Change the parent task and reorder items
When you need to change the order or grouping, drag the item to its new location.
You can reparent an item using the mapping pane, or drag it within the hierarchy to change its parent.

You can only reparent backlog items under other features, and features under other epics.
Also, to change an item's priority within a group, drag the item up or down within its hierarchical group.
Reordering from a portfolio backlog works the same as when youmoved items into priority order on your product backlog.
Limitations on reordering backlog items owned by other teams
If you find you can't reorder a backlog item, check whether theinfo icon appears in the first column as shown in the following image.

You can reparent items owned by other teams, but you can't reorder items owned by other teams. For more information, seeBacklogs, portfolios, and Agile project management, Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items.

Change a parent of multiple backlog items
From a product or portfolio backlog, you can multi-select several work items and chooseChange parentâ¦to link the items to a parent work item.


Add portfolio backlogs and boards
To add a portfolio backlog or board, customize your process, add new work item types, and then configuring your backlogs and boards. You can also add or modify the fields defined for a work item type (WIT) or add a custom WIT. For more information, seeCustomize an inheritance processandCustomize your backlogs or boards (Inheritance process).
To add a portfolio backlog or board, either customize your inherited process or modify your XML definition files. You can also add or modify the fields defined for a work item type (WIT) or add a custom WIT. For more information, see the following articles based on the process model used to update your project:
Inheritance process model:
Customize your backlogs or boards for a process.
Customize an inheritance process.
On-premises XML process model:
Customize work tracking

Display rollup progress counts, or totals
Product and portfolio backlogs support rollup columns. You can add one or more rollup columns to display progress bars, counts of descendant work items, or totals of select numeric fields. Your settings persist for each page that you customize and are only valid for your views.
Progress barsindicate the percentage of descendant items within a hierarchy that are closed or completed.
Countsdisplay the total number of descendant items.
Totalsprovide a sum of numeric fields, such as Effort, Story Points, Completed Work, or Remaining Work of descendant items.
The following example shows progress bars for a portfolio backlog.
