Data flows are available in both Azure Data Factory pipelines and Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines. This article applies to mapping data flows. If you're new to transformations, refer to the introductory articleTransform data using mapping data flows.
A mapping data flow provides a way to transform data at scale without any coding required. You can design a data transformation job in the data flow designer by constructing a series of transformations. Start with any number of source transformations, followed by data transformation steps. Then, complete your data flow with a sink to land your results in a destination.
