This article describes how to set up agent-based dependency analysis in Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment.Dependency analysishelps you to identify and understand dependencies across servers you want to assess and migrate to Azure.
Before you start
Review the support and deployment requirements for agent-based dependency analysis for:Servers in VMware environmentPhysical serversServers in Hyper-V environment

To use dependency visualization, you associate aLog Analytics workspacewith an Azure Migrate project:You can attach a workspace only after setting up the Azure Migrate appliance, and discovering servers in the Azure Migrate project.Make sure you have a workspace in the subscription that contains the Azure Migrate project.The workspace must reside in the East US, Southeast Asia, or West Europe regions. Workspaces in other regions can't be associated with a project.The workspace must be in a region in whichService Map is supported. You can monitor Azure VMs in any region. The VMs themselves aren't limited to the regions supported by the Log Analytics workspace.You attach the workspace the first time that you set up dependency visualization for a server. The workspace for an Azure Migrate project can't be modified after it's added.In Log Analytics, the workspace associated with Azure Migrate is tagged with the Migration Project key, and the project name.

Download and install the VM agents
On each server you want to analyze, install the agents.
Note
For servers monitored by System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2 or later, you don't need to install the MMA agent. Service Map integrates with Operations Manager.Followintegration guidance.

To install the MMA on a Linux server:
Transfer the appropriate bundle (x86 or x64) to your Linux computer using scp/sftp.
Transfer the appropriate bundle (x86 or x64) to your Linux computer using scp/sftp.
Install the bundle by using the --install argument.sudo sh ./omsagent-<version>.universal.x64.sh --install -w <workspace id> -s <workspace key>

Create a group using dependency visualization
Now create a group for assessment.
Note
Groups for which you want to visualize dependencies shouldn't contain more than 10 servers. If you have more than 10 servers, split them into smaller groups.
InAzure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, selectDiscovered servers.

In theDependenciescolumn, selectView dependenciesfor each server you want to review.
In theDependenciescolumn, selectView dependenciesfor each server you want to review.
On the dependency map, you can see the following:Inbound (clients) and outbound (servers) TCP connections, to and from the server.Dependent servers that don't have the dependency agents installed are grouped by port numbers.Dependent servers with dependency agents installed are shown as separate boxes.Processes running inside the server. Expand each server box to view the processes.Server properties (including FQDN, operating system, MAC address). Select each server box to view the details.

You can look at dependencies for different time durations by selecting on the time duration in the time range label.By default the range is an hour.You can modify the time range, or specify start and end dates, and duration.Time range can be up to an hour. If you need a longer range, use Azure Monitor to query dependent data for a longer period.

After creating the group, we recommend that you install agents on all the servers in the group, and then visualize dependencies for the entire group.
Query dependency data in Azure Monitor
You can query dependency data captured by Service Map in the Log Analytics workspace associated with the Azure Migrate project. Log Analytics is used to write and run Azure Monitor log queries.
Learn how tosearch for Service Map data in Log Analytics.
Get an overviewof writing log queries inLog Analytics.
Run a query for dependency data as follows:
After you install the agents, go to the portal and selectOverview.
InAzure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, selectOverview. Select the down arrow to expandEssentials.
InOMS Workspace, select the workspace name.
On the Log Analytics workspace page >General, selectLogs.
Write your query, and selectRun.
Sample queries
Here are a few sample queries that you can use to extract dependency data.
You can modify the queries to extract your preferred data points.

Review inbound connections for a set of servers.
The records in the table for connection metrics (VMConnection) don't represent individual physical network connections.
Multiple physical network connections are grouped into a logical connection.
