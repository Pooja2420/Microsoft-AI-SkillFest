The Azure Policy exemptions feature is used toexempta resource hierarchy or an individual resource from evaluation of initiatives or definitions. Resources that areexemptcount toward overall compliance, but can't be evaluated or have a temporary waiver. For more information, seeUnderstand applicability in Azure Policy. Azure Policy exemptions also work with the followingResource Manager modes:Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data,Microsoft.KeyVault.Data, andMicrosoft.Network.Data.
Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data
Microsoft.KeyVault.Data
Microsoft.Network.Data
You use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to create a policy exemption. The policy exemption contains elements for:
display name
description
metadata
policy assignment
policy definitions within an initiative
exemption category
expiration
resource selectors
assignment scope validation
A policy exemption is created as a child object on the resource hierarchy or the individual resource granted the exemption. Exemptions can't be created at the Resource Provider mode component level. If the parent resource to which the exemption applies is removed, then the exemption is removed as well.
For example, the following JSON shows a policy exemption in thewaivercategory of a resource to an initiative assignment namedresourceShouldBeCompliantInit. The resource isexemptfrom only two of the policy definitions in the initiative, thecustomOrgPolicycustom policy definition (policyDefinitionReferenceId:requiredTags) and theAllowed locationsbuilt-in policy definition (policyDefinitionReferenceId:allowedLocations):
resourceShouldBeCompliantInit
customOrgPolicy
policyDefinitionReferenceId
requiredTags
policyDefinitionReferenceId

Metadata
Themetadataproperty allows creating any child property needed for storing relevant information. In the example, propertiesrequestedBy,approvedBy,approvedOn, andticketRefcontains customer values to provide information on who requested the exemption, who approved it and when, and an internal tracking ticket for the request. Thesemetadataproperties are examples, but they aren't required andmetadataisn't limited to these child properties.

Policy assignment ID
This field must be the full path name of either a policy assignment or an initiative assignment. ThepolicyAssignmentIdis a string and not an array. This property defines which assignment the parent resource hierarchy or individual resource isexemptfrom.
policyAssignmentId
Policy definition IDs
If thepolicyAssignmentIdis for an initiative assignment, thepolicyDefinitionReferenceIdproperty might be used to specify which policy definition in the initiative the subject resource has an exemption to. As the resource might be exempted from one or more included policy definitions, this property is anarray. The values must match the values in the initiative definition in thepolicyDefinitions.policyDefinitionReferenceIdfields.
policyAssignmentId
policyDefinitionReferenceId
policyDefinitions.policyDefinitionReferenceId
Exemption category
Two exemption categories exist and are used to group exemptions:
Mitigated: The exemption is granted because the policy intent is met through another method.
Waiver: The exemption is granted because the non-compliance state of the resource is temporarily accepted. Another reason to use this category is to exclude a resource or resource hierarchy from one or more definitions in an initiative, but shouldn't be excluded from the entire initiative.
Expiration
To set when a resource hierarchy or an individual resource is no longerexemptfrom an assignment, set theexpiresOnproperty. This optional property must be in the Universal ISO 8601 DateTime formatyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ.
expiresOn
yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ
Note
The policy exemptions isn't deleted when theexpiresOndate is reached. The object is preserved for record-keeping, but the exemption is no longer honored.
expiresOn
Resource selectors
Exemptions support an optional propertyresourceSelectorsthat works the same way in exemptions as it does in assignments. The property allows for gradual rollout or rollback of anexemptionto certain subsets of resources in a controlled manner based on resource type, resource location, or whether the resource has a location. More details about how to use resource selectors can be found in theassignment structure. The following JSON is an example exemption that uses resource selectors. In this example, only resources inwestcentralusare exempt from the policy assignment:
resourceSelectors

{
  "properties": {
    "policyAssignmentId": "/subscriptions/{subId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/CostManagement",
    "policyDefinitionReferenceId": [
      "limitSku",
      "limitType"
    ],
    "exemptionCategory": "Waiver",
    "resourceSelectors": [
      {
        "name": "TemporaryMitigation",
        "selectors": [
          {
            "kind": "resourceLocation",
            "in": [
              "westcentralus"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "systemData": { ...
  },

  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions",
  "name": "DemoExpensiveVM"
}
{
  "properties": {
    "policyAssignmentId": "/subscriptions/{subId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/CostManagement",
    "policyDefinitionReferenceId": [
      "limitSku",
      "limitType"
    ],
    "exemptionCategory": "Waiver",
    "resourceSelectors": [
      {
        "name": "TemporaryMitigation",
        "selectors": [
          {
            "kind": "resourceLocation",
            "in": [
              "westcentralus"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "systemData": { ...
  },
  "id": "/subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions/DemoExpensiveVM",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions",
  "name": "DemoExpensiveVM"
}
Regions can be added or removed from theresourceLocationlist in the example. Resource selectors allow for greater flexibility of where and how exemptions can be created and managed.

Assignment scope validation (preview)
In most scenarios, the exemption scope is validated to ensure it's at or under the policy assignment scope. The optionalassignmentScopeValidationproperty can allow an exemption to bypass this validation and be created outside of the assignment scope. This validation is intended for situations where a subscription needs to be moved from one management group (MG) to another, but the move would be blocked by policy due to properties of resources within the subscription. In this scenario, an exemption could be created for the subscription in its current MG to exempt its resources from a policy assignment on the destination MG. That way, when the subscription is moved into the destination MG, the operation isn't blocked because resources are already exempt from the policy assignment in question. The use of this property is shown in the following example:
assignmentScopeValidation
{
  "properties": {
    "policyAssignmentId": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mgName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/CostManagement",
    "policyDefinitionReferenceId": [
      "limitSku",
      "limitType"
    ],
    "exemptionCategory": "Waiver",
    "assignmentScopeValidation": "DoNotValidate",
  },
  "systemData": { ...
  },
  "id": "/subscriptions/{subId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions/DemoExpensiveVM",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions",
  "name": "DemoExpensiveVM"
}
{
  "properties": {
    "policyAssignmentId": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mgName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/CostManagement",
    "policyDefinitionReferenceId": [
      "limitSku",
      "limitType"
    ],
    "exemptionCategory": "Waiver",
    "assignmentScopeValidation": "DoNotValidate",
  },
  "systemData": { ...
  },
  "id": "/subscriptions/{subId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions/DemoExpensiveVM",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions",
  "name": "DemoExpensiveVM"
}
Allowed values forassignmentScopeValidationareDefaultandDoNotValidate. If not specified, the default validation process occurs.

Required permissions
The Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions needed to manage Policy exemption objects are in theMicrosoft.Authorization/policyExemptionsoperation group. The built-in rolesResource Policy ContributorandSecurity Adminboth have thereadandwritepermissions andPolicy Insights Data Writer (Preview)has thereadpermission.

Exemptions have extra security measures because of the effect of granting an exemption. Beyond requiring theMicrosoft.Authorization/policyExemptions/writeoperation on the resource hierarchy or individual resource, the creator of an exemption must have theexempt/Actionverb on the target assignment.

Exemption creation and management
Exemptions are recommended for time-bound or specific scenarios where a resource or resource hierarchy should still be tracked and would otherwise be evaluated, but there's a specific reason it shouldn't be assessed for compliance. For example, if an environment has the built-in definitionStorage accounts should disable public network access(ID:b2982f36-99f2-4db5-8eff-283140c09693) assigned witheffectset toaudit. Upon compliance assessment, resourceStorageAcc1is non-compliant, butStorageAcc1must have public network access enable for business purposes. At that time, a request should be submitted to create an exemption resource that targetsStorageAcc1. After the exemption is created,StorageAcc1is shown asexemptin compliance review.

Regularly revisit your exemptions to ensure that all eligible items are appropriately exempted and promptly remove any that don't qualify for exemption. At that time, expired exemption resources can be deleted as well.
