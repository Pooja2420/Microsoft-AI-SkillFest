In this article
As part of your migration journey to Azure, you discover your servers for assessment and migration.
This tutorial shows you how to discover Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instances with the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool, using a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance. You deploy the appliance on a server on GCP, to continuously discover machine and performance metadata.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Set up an Azure account.
Prepare server on GCP for discovery.
Create a project.
Set up the Azure Migrate appliance.
Start continuous discovery.
Note
Tutorials show the quickest path for trying out a scenario and using default options.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, check you have these prerequisites in place.
Prepare an Azure user account
To create a project and register the Azure Migrate appliance, you need an account with:
Contributor or Owner permissions on an Azure subscription.
Permissions to register Microsoft Entra apps.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription. If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the permissions as follows:
In the Azure portal, search for "subscriptions", and underServices, selectSubscriptions.

Prepare GCP instances
Set up an account that the appliance can use to access servers on  GCP.
ForWindows servers:Set up a local user account on non-domain joined servers, and a domain account on domain joined servers that you want to include in the discovery. Add the user account to the following groups:Remote Management UsersPerformance Monitor UsersPerformance Log users.

ForLinux servers:You need a root account on the Linux servers that you want to discover. If you aren't able to provide a root account, refer to the instructions in thesupport matrixfor an alternative.Azure Migrate uses password authentication when discovering GCP instances. GCP instances don't support password authentication by default. Before you can discover instance, you need to enable password authentication.Sign into each Linux  machine.Open the sshd_config file: vi /etc/ssh/sshd_configIn the file, locate thePasswordAuthenticationline, and change the value toyes.Save the file and close it.

Set up the appliance
The Azure Migrate appliance is a lightweight appliance, used by Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment to do the following:
Discover on-premises servers.
Send metadata and performance data for discovered servers to Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment.
Learn moreabout the Azure Migrate appliance.
To set up the appliance, you:
Provide an appliance name and generate a project key in the portal.
Download a zipped file with Azure Migrate installer script from the Azure portal.
Extract the contents from the zipped file. Launch the PowerShell console with administrative privileges.
Execute the PowerShell script to launch the appliance web application.
Configure the appliance for the first time and register it with the project using the project key.
1. Generate the project key
InMigration goals>Servers, databases and web apps>Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, selectDiscover.
InDiscover servers>Are your servers virtualized?, selectPhysical or other (AWS, GCP, Xen, etc.).
In1:Generate project key, provide a name for the Azure Migrate appliance that you'll set up for discovery of your GCP virtual servers. The name should be alphanumeric with 14 characters or fewer.
SelectGenerate keyto start the creation of the required Azure resources. Don't close the Discover servers page during the creation of resources.
After the successful creation of the Azure resources, aproject keyis generated.
Copy the key as you'll need it to complete the registration of the appliance during its configuration.
2. Download the installer script
In2: Download Azure Migrate appliance, selectDownload.
Verify security
Check that the zipped file is secure before you deploy it.
On the machine to which you downloaded the file, open an administrator command window.
Run the following command to generate the hash for the zipped file:C:\>CertUtil -HashFile <file_location> [Hashing Algorithm]Example usage for public cloud:C:\>CertUtil -HashFile C:\Users\administrator\Desktop\AzureMigrateInstaller-Server-Public.zip SHA256Example usage for government cloud:C:\>CertUtil -HashFile C:\Users\administrator\Desktop\AzureMigrateInstaller-Server-USGov.zip SHA256

To perform discovery of SQL Server instances and databases, you can add additional credentials (Windows domain/non-domain, SQL authentication credentials) and the appliance will attempt to automatically map the credentials to the SQL servers. If you add domain credentials, the appliance will authenticate the credentials against Active Directory of the domain to prevent any user accounts from locking out. To check validation of the domain credentials, follow these steps:

How discovery works
It takes approximately 2 minutes to complete discovery of 100 servers and their metadata to appear in the Azure portal.

Software inventory(discovery of installed applications) is automatically initiated when the discovery of servers is finished.
Software inventory(discovery of installed applications) is automatically initiated when the discovery of servers is finished.
Software inventoryidentifies the SQL Server instances that are running on the servers. Using the information it collects, the appliance attempts to connect to the SQL Server instances through the Windows authentication credentials or the SQL Server authentication credentials that are provided on the appliance. Then, it gathers data on SQL Server databases and their properties. The SQL Server discovery is performed once every 24 hours.

The time taken for discovery of installed applications depends on the number of discovered servers. For 500 servers, it takes approximately one hour for the discovered inventory to appear in the Azure Migrate project in the portal.

During software inventory, the added server credentials are iterated against servers and validated for agentless dependency analysis. When the discovery of servers is finished, in the portal, you can enable agentless dependency analysis on the servers. Only the servers on which validation succeeds can be selected to enableagentless dependency analysis.

By default, Azure Migrate uses the most secure way of connecting to SQL instances that is, Azure Migrate encrypts communication between the Azure Migrate appliance and the source SQL Server instances by setting the TrustServerCertificate property totrue. Additionally, the transport layer uses SSL to encrypt the channel and bypass the certificate chain to validate trust. Hence, the appliance server must be set up to trust the certificate's root authority. However, you can modify the connection settings, by selectingEdit SQL Server connection propertieson the appliance.Learn moreto understand what to choose.

Verify servers in the portal
After discovery finishes, you can verify that the servers appear in the portal.
