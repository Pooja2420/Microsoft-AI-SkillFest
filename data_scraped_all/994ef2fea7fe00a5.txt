The NCCads H100 v5 series of virtual machines are a new addition to the Azure GPU family. In this VM SKU, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) spans confidential VM on the CPU and attached GPU, enabling secure offload of data, models, and computation to the GPU.
The NCCads H100 v5 series is powered by 4th-generation AMD EPYCâ¢ Genoa processors and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. These VMs feature 1 NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs with 94 GB memory, 40 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Genoa processor cores, and 320 GiB of system memory. These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as:
GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
Machine Learning (ML) development
Video processing
AI/ML web services

Introduction to Azure managed disks
Azure managed disk types

1Temp disk speed often differs between RR (Random Read) and RW (Random Write) operations. RR operations are typically faster than RW operations. The RW speed is usually slower than the RR speed on series where only the RR speed value is listed.
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
