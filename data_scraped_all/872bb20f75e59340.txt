This article walks you through the steps to add and remove a virtual network gateway for a pre-existing virtual network (virtual network). The steps for this configuration apply to VNets that were created using the Resource Manager deployment model for an ExpressRoute configuration. For more information about virtual network gateways and gateway configuration settings for ExpressRoute, seeAbout virtual network gateways for ExpressRoute.

Prerequisites
The steps for this tutorial use the values in the following configuration reference list. You can copy the list to use as a reference, replacing the values with your own.

Create the gateway subnet
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Select+ Gateway subnetto add a gateway subnet.
TheNamefor your subnet is automatically filled in with the value 'GatewaySubnet'. This value is required in order for Azure to recognize the subnet as the gateway subnet. Adjust the autofilledAddress rangevalues to match your configuration requirements.You need to create the GatewaySubnet with a /27 or larger(/26, /25, and so on.). /28 or smaller subnets are not supported for new deployments. If you plan on connecting 16 ExpressRoute circuits to your gateway, youmustcreate a gateway subnet of /26 or larger.If you're using a dual stack virtual network and plan to use IPv6-based private peering over ExpressRoute, selectAdd IPv6 address spaceand enterIPv6 address rangevalues.Then, selectOKto save the values and create the gateway subnet.

On theCreate virtual network gatewaypage, enter or select these settings:SettingValueProject detailsSubscriptionVerify that the correct subscription is selected.Resource GroupThe resource group gets automatically chosen once you select the virtual network.Instance detailsNameName your gateway. This name isn't the same as naming a gateway subnet. It's the name of the gateway resource you're creating.RegionChange theRegionfield to point to the location where your virtual network is located. If the region isn't pointing to the location where your virtual network is, the virtual network doesn't appear in theVirtual networkdropdown.If you want to create the gateway in anAzure Extended Zone, selectDeploy to an Azure Extended Zone.Gateway typeSelectExpressRoute.SKUSelect a gateway SKU from the dropdown.

Note
To create the gateway in anAzure Extended Zone, you must firstrequest access to the Extended Zone. Once you have access, you can create the gateway.
The following considerations apply when creating a virtual network gateway in an Extended Zone:
Availability Zones aren't supported in Azure Extended Zones.
The following SKUs are currently supported in Azure Extended Zones:Standard,HighPerformance,UltraPerformance.
Local SKU circuit isn't supported with gateways in Azure Extended Zone.
SelectReview + Create, and thenCreateto begin creating the gateway. The settings are validated and the gateway deploys. Creating virtual network gateway can take up to 45 minutes to complete.

Enable or disable VNet to VNet or VNet to Virtual WAN traffic through ExpressRoute
You can enable or disable VNet to VNet or VNet to WAN connectivity through ExpressRoute. By default, VNet to VNet or VNet to WAN traffic is disabled through ExpressRoute. You can enable this traffic by using the following steps.
In the Azure portal, navigate to the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.
In the Azure portal, navigate to the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.
In theSettingssection, selectConfiguration.
In theSettingssection, selectConfiguration.
In theConfigurationsection, select the checkbox forAllow traffic from remote virtual networks. You can also enable traffic from remote Virtual WAN networks by selecting the checkbox forAllow traffic from remote Virtual WAN network.
In theConfigurationsection, select the checkbox forAllow traffic from remote virtual networks. You can also enable traffic from remote Virtual WAN networks by selecting the checkbox forAllow traffic from remote Virtual WAN network.

These steps will need to be completed on all virtual networks that need to communicate with each other through ExpressRoute.
Clean up resources
If you no longer need the ExpressRoute gateway, locate the gateway in the virtual network resource group and selectDelete. Ensure the gateway doesn't have any connections to a circuit.
