External collaboration settings let you specify what roles in your organization can invite external users for B2B collaboration. These settings also include options forallowing or blocking specific domains, and options for restricting what external guest users can see in your Microsoft Entra directory. The following options are available:
Determine guest user access: Microsoft Entra External ID allows you to restrict what external guest users can see in your Microsoft Entra directory. For example, you can limit guest users' view of group memberships, or allow guests to view only their own profile information.

Specify who can invite guests: By default, all users in your organization, including B2B collaboration guest users, can invite external users to B2B collaboration. If you want to limit the ability to send invitations, you can turn invitations on or off for everyone, or limit invitations to certain roles.

Enable guest self-service sign-up via user flows: For applications you build, you can create user flows that allow a user to sign up for an app and create a new guest account. You can enable the feature in your external collaboration settings, and thenadd a self-service sign-up user flow to your app.

Allow or block domains: You can use collaboration restrictions to allow or deny invitations to the domains you specify. For details, seeAllow or block domains.

For B2B collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations, you should also review yourcross-tenant access settingsto ensure your inbound and outbound B2B collaboration and scope access to specific users, groups, and applications.
For B2B collaboration end-users who perform cross-tenant sign-ins, their home tenant branding appears, even if there isn't custom branding specified. In the following example, the company branding for Woodgrove Groceries appears on the left. The example on the right displays the default branding for the user's home tenant.

Note
In the Microsoft Entra admin center, you must be assigned the Global Administrator role to activate the External Collaboration Settings page and update the settings. When using Microsoft Graph, lesser privileged roles might be available for individual settings; seeConfigure settings with Microsoft Graphlater in this article.

To configure collaboration restrictions (allow or block domains)
Important
Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This practice helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios or when you can't use an existing role.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin center.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin center.

UnderCollaboration restrictions, you can choose whether to allow or deny invitations to the domains you specify and enter specific domain names in the text boxes. For multiple domains, enter each domain on a new line. For more information, seeAllow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations.

Configure settings with Microsoft Graph
External collaboration settings can be configured by using the Microsoft Graph API:
ForGuest user access restrictionsandGuest invite restrictions, use theauthorizationPolicyresource type.
For theEnable guest self-service sign up via user flowssetting, use theauthenticationFlowsPolicyresource type.
ForExternal user leave settings, use theexternalidentitiespolicyresource type.
For email one-time passcode settings (now on theAll identity providerspage in the Microsoft Entra admin center), use theemailAuthenticationMethodConfigurationresource type.
Assign the Guest Inviter role to a user
With theGuest Inviterrole, you can give individual users the ability to invite guests without assigning them a higher privilege administrator role. Users with the Guest Inviter role are able to invite guests even when the optionOnly users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest usersis selected (underGuest invite settings).
Here's an example that shows how to use Microsoft Graph PowerShell to add a user to theGuest Inviterrole:
Guest Inviter
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement

$roleName = "Guest Inviter"
$role = Get-MgDirectoryRole | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $roleName}
$userId = <User Id/User Principal Name>

$DirObject = @{
  "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/$userId"
  }

New-MgDirectoryRoleMemberByRef -DirectoryRoleId $role.Id -BodyParameter $DirObject
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement

$roleName = "Guest Inviter"
$role = Get-MgDirectoryRole | where {$_.DisplayName -eq $roleName}
$userId = <User Id/User Principal Name>

$DirObject = @{
  "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/$userId"
  }

New-MgDirectoryRoleMemberByRef -DirectoryRoleId $role.Id -BodyParameter $DirObject
Sign-in logs for B2B users
When a B2B user signs into a resource tenant to collaborate, a sign-in log is generated in both the home tenant and the resource tenant. These logs include information such as the application being used, email addresses, tenant name, and tenant ID for both the home tenant and the resource tenant.
