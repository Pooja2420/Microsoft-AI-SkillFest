This table includes more detailed descriptions of some metrics.
Storage breakdown metricsprovide valuable insights into the storage usage of your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. These metrics give you a detailed breakdown of the storage limit, storage percentage, storage used, data storage used, ibdata1 storage used, binlog storage used, other storage used, and backup storage used. By monitoring these metrics, you can effectively manage your storage resources, optimize storage allocation, and ensure efficient utilization of your server's storage capacity. Understanding the storage breakdown metrics helps you make informed decisions to maintain the performance and availability of your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.
The table below lists descriptions for the storage breakdown metrics available for Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server:
Replication metricsprovide valuable insights into the performance and status of replication in Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. These metrics allow you to monitor the replication lag, check the status of replica and HA IO/SQL threads, and measure the replication latency. By tracking these metrics, you can ensure the reliability and efficiency of your replication setup, identify any potential issues or delays, and take appropriate actions to maintain data consistency and availability. Let's explore the different replication metrics available for Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.
The table below lists the replication metrics available for Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server:
In addition to the standard metrics provided by Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, enhanced metrics are available to gain deeper insights into your server's performance. These enhanced metrics provide more granular information about specific aspects of your workload.
TheData Manipulation Language (DML) statistics metricsgive you visibility into the number of select, update, insert, and delete statements executed on your server. By monitoring these metrics, you can track the usage and performance of your database operations and identify any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
TheData Definition Language (DDL) statistics metricsprovide information about how often you can create a database, drop a database, create a table, drop a table, and alter table statements run on your server. These metrics help you understand the frequency and impact of schema changes in your database, allowing you to optimize your database design and improve overall performance.
TheInnodb metricsfocus on the performance of the InnoDB storage engine, which is the default engine for Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. These metrics include InnoDB row lock time, InnoDB row lock waits, Innodb buffer pool reads, Innodb buffer pool read requests, and more. By monitoring these metrics, you can gain insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of your database's storage and caching mechanisms.
These enhanced metrics provide valuable information for optimizing your workload and improving the performance of your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. Using these metrics, you can make data-driven decisions to enhance your database operations' scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

This service doesn't have any metrics that contain dimensions.
Troubleshoot metrics
Sometimes, you might encounter issues with creating, customizing, or interpreting charts in Azure Metrics Explorer.
AChart showing no datacould arise due to various factors. These issues might include the Microsoft Insights resource provider not being registered for your subscription or you lacking adequate access rights to your Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server. Other possibilities could be that your resource didn't generate metrics within the chosen time frame or the selected time range exceeds 30 days.
Several reasons that follow can cause this behavior:
Microsoft.Insights resource provider isn't registered: Exploring metrics requires Microsoft.Insights resource provider registered in your subscription. Register your server manually by following the steps described inAzure resource providers and types.
Insufficient access rights to your resource: Ensure you have sufficient permissions for your Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server from which you're exploring metrics. Your resource didn't emit metrics during the selected time range. Change the time of the chart to a wider range. In Azure,Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)controls access to metrics. You must be a member ofmonitoring reader,monitoring contributor, orcontributorto explore metrics for any resource.
Your resource didn't emit metrics during the selected time range: This behavior could be due to several reasons. One possibility is that your resource didn't generate metrics within the chosen time frame. Change the time of the chart to a broader range to see if this approach resolves the issue. For more detailed information on troubleshooting this issue, refer to theAzure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide.
Time range greater than 30 days: Verify that the difference between the start and end dates in the time picker doesn't exceed the 30-day interval. For more detailed information on troubleshooting metrics, refer to theAzure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide.
Dashed Line Indication: In Azure Monitor, a dashed line signifies a gap in data, or anull value, between two points of known time grain data. This aspect is a deliberate design that helps detect missing data points. If your chart displays dashed lines, it indicates missing data. For more information, seeChart shows dashed line.
For more detailed information on troubleshooting metrics, refer to theAzure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide.
Note
Metrics marked as deprecated are scheduled to be removed from the Azure portal. You should ignore these metrics when monitoring your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.
