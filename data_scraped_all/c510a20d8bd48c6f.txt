Perform the steps in this article in sequence to install the Start/Stop VMs v2 feature. After completing the setup process, configure the schedules to customize it to your requirements.
Permissions and Policy considerations
Keep the following considerations in mind before and during deployment:
The solution allows users with appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) permissions on the Start/Stop v2 deployment to add, remove, and manage schedules for virtual machines under the scope of the Start/Stop VMs v2 instance. This behavior is by design. In practice, this means a user who doesn't have explicit permissions on a virtual machine could still create start, stop, and autostop operations on that virtual machine when they have the permission to modify the Start/Stop v2 solution managing the virtual machine.

Any users with access to the Start/Stop v2 solution could uncover cost, savings, operation history, and other data that is stored in the Application Insights instance used by the Start/Stop v2 application.

When managing a Start/Stop v2 solution, you should consider the permissions of users to the Start/Stop v2 solution, particularly when whey don't have permission to directly modify the target virtual machines.

When you deploy the Start/Stop v2 solution to a new or existing resource group, a tag namedSolutionNamewith a value ofStartStopV2is added to resource group and to its resources that are deployed by Start/Stop v2. Any other tags on these resources are removed. If you have an Azure policy that denies management operations based on resource tags, you must allow management operations for resources that contain only this tag.

Deploy feature
The deployment is initiated from theStart/Stop VMs v2 GitHub organization. While this feature is intended to manage all of your VMs in your subscription across all resource groups from a single deployment within the subscription, you can install another instance of it based on the operations model or requirements of your organization. It also can be configured to centrally manage VMs across multiple subscriptions.
To simplify management and removal, we recommend you deploy Start/Stop VMs v2 to a dedicated resource group.
Note
Currently this solution does not support specifying an existing Storage account or Application Insights resource.
Note
The naming format for the function app and storage account has changed. To guarantee global uniqueness, a random and unique string is now appended to the names of these resource.

We are collecting operation and heartbeat telemetry to better assist you if you reach the support team for any troubleshooting. We are also collecting virtual machine event history to verify when the service acted on a virtual machine and how long a virtual machine was snoozed in order to determine the efficacy of the service.
Enable multiple subscriptions

Configure schedules overview
To manage the automation method to control the start and stop of your VMs, you configure one or more of the included logic apps based on your requirements.
Scheduled - Start and stop actions are based on a schedule you specify against Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs.ststv2_vms_Scheduled_startandststv2_vms_Scheduled_stopconfigure the scheduled start and stop.

Sequenced - Start and stop actions are based on a schedule targeting VMs with pre-defined sequencing tags. Only two named tags are supported -sequencestartandsequencestop.ststv2_vms_Sequenced_startandststv2_vms_Sequenced_stopconfigure the sequenced start and stop.NoteThis scenario only supports Azure Resource Manager VMs.

Note
This scenario only supports Azure Resource Manager VMs.
AutoStop - This functionality is only used for performing a stop action against both Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs based on its CPU utilization. It can also be a scheduled-basedtake action, which creates alerts on VMs and based on the condition, the alert is triggered to perform the stop action.ststv2_vms_AutoStopconfigures the auto-stop functionality.

If you need additional schedules, you can duplicate one of the Logic Apps provided using theCloneoption in the Azure portal.
Scheduled start and stop scenario
Perform the following steps to configure the scheduled start and stop action for Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs. For example, you can configure theststv2_vms_Scheduled_startschedule to start them in the morning when you are in the office, and stop all VMs across a subscription when you leave work in the evening based on theststv2_vms_Scheduled_stopschedule.
Configuring the logic app to just start the VMs is supported.
For each scenario, you can target the action against one or more subscriptions, single or multiple resource groups, and specify one or more VMs in an inclusion or exclusion list. You cannot specify them together in the same logic app.

Auto stop scenario
Start/Stop VMs v2 can help manage the cost of running Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs in your subscription by evaluating machines that aren't used during non-peak periods, such as after hours, and automatically shutting them down if processor utilization is less than a specified percentage.
The following metric alert properties in the request body support customization:
AutoStop_MetricName
AutoStop_Condition
AutoStop_Threshold
AutoStop_Description
AutoStop_Frequency
AutoStop_Severity
AutoStop_Threshold
AutoStop_TimeAggregationOperator
AutoStop_TimeWindow

VM Tags
You can also include or exclude specific VMs from start and stop actions by settings tags on the VMs themselves. To add a tag, navigate to the specific VM, selectTagsfrom the left menu, and add a tag namedssv2excludevm. To exclude this VM from the start or stop action, set the value of this new tag totrue. To include the VM in the action, set the value tofalse. This gives you a way to exclude specific VMs without having to updateExcludedVMListsin the payload configuration.
