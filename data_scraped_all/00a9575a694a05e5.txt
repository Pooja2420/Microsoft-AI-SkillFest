Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)provides a mechanism for instrumentation of user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers. The Log Analytics agent is used tocollect Windows eventswritten to the Administrative and OperationalETW channels. However, it is occasionally necessary to capture and analyze other events, such as those written to the Analytic channel.
Important
The legacyLog Analytics agentis deprecated as of August 31, 2024. Microsoft will no longer provide any support for the Log Analytics agent. If you use the Log Analytics agent to ingest data to Azure Monitor,migrate now to Azure Monitor agent.
Event flow
To successfully collectmanifest-based ETW eventsfor analysis in Azure Monitor Logs, you must use theAzure diagnostics extensionfor Windows (WAD). In this scenario, the diagnostics extension acts as the ETW consumer, writing events to Azure Storage (tables) as an intermediate store. Here it will be stored in a table namedWADETWEventTable. Log Analytics then collects the table data from Azure storage, presenting it as a table namedETWEvent.

Configuring ETW Log collection
Step 1: Locate the correct ETW provider
Use either of the following commands to enumerate the ETW providers on a source Windows System.
Command line:logman query providers
Command line:
logman query providers
logman query providers
PowerShell:Get-NetEventProvider -ShowInstalled | Select-Object Name, Guid
PowerShell:
Get-NetEventProvider -ShowInstalled | Select-Object Name, Guid
Get-NetEventProvider -ShowInstalled | Select-Object Name, Guid
Optionally, you may choose to pipe this PowerShell output to Out-Gridview to aid navigation.
Record the ETW provider name and GUID that aligns to the Analytic or Debug log that is presented in the Event Viewer, or to the module you intend to collect event data for.
Step 2: Diagnostics extension
Ensure theWindows diagnostics extensionisinstalledon all source systems.
Step 3: Configure ETW log collection

Once matching events are generated, theWADetweventtabletable in Azure Storage is created and begins to populate the ETW events. Use Azure Storage Explorer to confirm this.
Step 4: Configure Log Analytics storage account collection
Followthese instructionsto collect the logs from Azure Storage. Once configured, the ETW event data should appear in Log Analytics under theETWEventtable.
