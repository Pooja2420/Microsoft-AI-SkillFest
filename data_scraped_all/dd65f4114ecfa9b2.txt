This article describes how to view alerts and interpret alert severity for events on your Azure Stack Edge devices. The alerts generate notifications in the Azure portal. The article includes a quick-reference for Azure Stack Edge alerts.
Overview
The Alerts blade for an Azure Stack Edge device lets you review Azure Stack Edge deviceârelated alerts in real-time. From this blade, you can centrally monitor the health issues of your Azure Stack Edge devices and the overall Microsoft Azure Stack Edge solution.
The initial display is a high-level summary of alerts at each severity level. You can drill down to see individual alerts at each severity level.

Alert severity levels
Alerts have different severity levels, depending on the impact of the alert situation and the need for a response to the alert. The severity levels are:
Criticalâ This alert is in response to a condition that is affecting the successful performance of your system. Action is required to ensure that Azure Stack Edge service isn't interrupted.
Warningâ This condition could become critical if not resolved. You should investigate the situation and take any action required to resolve the issue.
Informationalâ This alert contains information that can be useful in tracking and managing your system.
Configure alert notifications
You can also send alert notifications by email for events on your Azure Stack Edge devices. To manage these alert notifications, you create action rules. The action rules can trigger or suppress alert notifications for device events within a resource group, an Azure subscription, or on a device. For more information, seeUsing action rules to manage alert notifications.
Alerts quick-reference
The following tables list some of the Azure Stack Edge alerts that you might run across, with descriptions and recommended actions. The alerts are grouped in the following categories:
Cloud connectivity alerts
Edge compute alerts
Local Azure Resource Manager alerts
Performance alerts
Storage alerts
Security alerts
Key vault alerts
Hardware alerts
Update alerts
Virtual machine alerts
Note
In the alerts tables below, some alerts are triggered by more than one event type. If the events have different recommended actions, the table has an alert entry for each of the events.
Cloud connectivity alerts
The following alerts are raised by a failed connection to an Azure Stack Edge device or when no heartbeat is detected.
The Internet connectivity is broken.Check your internet connection. In the local web UI of the device, go toTroubleshooting>Diagnostic tests. Run the diagnostic tests. Resolve the reported issues.
The device is turned off or paused on the hypervisor. Turn on your device! For more information, go toManage power.
Your device could have rebooted due to an update. Wait a few minutes and try to reconnect.
Edge compute alerts
