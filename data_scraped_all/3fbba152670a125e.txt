Azure Virtual Network encryption is a feature of Azure Virtual Networks. Virtual network encryption allows you to seamlessly encrypt and decrypt traffic between Azure Virtual Machines by creating a DTLS tunnel.
Virtual network encryption enables you to encrypt traffic between Virtual Machines and Virtual Machines Scale Sets within the same virtual network. Virtual network encryption encrypts traffic between regionally and globally peered virtual networks. For more information about virtual network peering, seeVirtual network peering.
Virtual network encryption enhances existing encryption in transit capabilities in Azure. For more information about encryption in Azure, seeAzure encryption overview.
Requirements
Virtual network encryption has the following requirements:

Virtual Network encryption is supported on the following virtual machine instance sizes:
Accelerated Networking must be enabled on the network interface of the virtual machine. For more information about Accelerated Networking, see â¯What is Accelerated Networking?

Encryption is only applied to traffic between virtual machines in a virtual network. Traffic is encrypted from a private IP address to a private IP address.

Traffic to unsupported Virtual Machines is unencrypted. Use Virtual Network Flow Logs to confirm flow encryption between virtual machines. For more information, seeVirtual network flow logs.

Availability
Azure Virtual Network encryption is generally available in all Azure public regions and is currently in public preview in Azure Government and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.
Limitations
Azure Virtual Network encryption has the following limitations:
In scenarios where a PaaS is involved, the virtual machine where the PaaS is hosted dictates if virtual network encryption is supported. The virtual machine must meet the listed requirements.

Virtual Network encryption shouldn't be enabled in virtual networks that have Azure confidential computing VM SKUs. If you want to use Azure confidential computing VMs in virtual networks where Virtual Network encryption is enabled, then:Enable Accelerated Networking on the VM's NIC if it's supported.If Accelerated Networking isn't supported, change the VM SKU to one that supports Accelerated Networking or Virtual Network encryption.Don't enable Virtual Network encryption if the VM SKU doesn't support Accelerated Networking or Virtual Network encryption.
