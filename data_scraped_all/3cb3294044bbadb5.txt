Quickstart: Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database

Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. To use Azure Data Explorer, you first create a cluster and then create one or more databases in that cluster. This article covers how to create a free cluster and database or create a full cluster and a database. To decide which is right for you, check thefeature comparison.
In this article, the full cluster is created in the Azure portal. You can also create a full cluster and database using C#, Python, Go, the Azure CLI, PowerShell, or an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. For more information, seeCreate a cluster and database.
For information on cluster subscription limits, seeAzure Data Explorer limits.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites vary whether creating a free or full cluster. Select the relevant tab.
Free cluster

For a production system, select the specification that best meets your needs.Availability zonesOnTurning on this feature distributes the cluster storage and compute resources across multiple physical zones within a region for added protection and availability. By default, this feature is turned on if zones are supported in the region. If fewer than 3 zones are available for the compute instances, the portal displays the number of supported zones. Deployment to availability zones is possible when creating the cluster orcan be migrated later. Read more aboutAzure Availability Zones.

Note
If the deployment fails with the error "SubscriptionNotRegistered", retry the operation.
Deployment fails when the Kusto resource provider isn't registered on the subscription described inAzure resource providers and types. When the deployment fails, the Kusto resource provider registers itself on the subscription, and the retry can then succeed.
Create a database
Select the relevant tab to learn how to create a database within your cluster.
Free cluster

To create a database in your free cluster:
Open theAzure Data Explorer web UI.

From the left menu, selectMy cluster.

To create a database in your full cluster:
Go to your cluster in theAzure portal.
Go to your cluster in theAzure portal.
On theOverviewtab, selectCreate database.
On theOverviewtab, selectCreate database.

Fill out the form with the following information.SettingSuggested valueField descriptionAdminDefault selectedThe admin field is disabled. New admins can be added after database creation.Database nameTestDatabaseThe name of database to create. The name must be unique within the cluster.Retention period365The number of days that data is guaranteed to be kept available for querying. The period is measured from the time data is ingested.Cache period31The number of days to keep frequently queried data available in SSD storage or RAM to optimize querying.
Fill out the form with the following information.

Run commands in the database
After you created the cluster and database, you can run queries and commands. The database doesn't have data yet, but you can still see how the tools work.
Free cluster
Full cluster
UnderActions, find theQuery datapanel. Then, selectQuery. Paste the command.show databasesinto the query window, then selectRun. The result set showsTestDatabase, the only database in the cluster.

.show databases

Paste the command.show tablesinto the query window and selectRun. This command returns an empty result set because you don't have any tables yet. You'll add a table in the next article in this series.

Stop and restart the cluster
Free cluster
Full cluster
You can't stop and restart a free cluster.
You can stop and restart a cluster depending on business needs. Stopping the cluster significantly reduces cost as it releases the compute resources, which are the bulk of the overall cluster cost, without deleting the database.
To stop the cluster, at the top of theOverviewtab, selectStop.NoteWhen the cluster is stopped, data is not available for queries, and you can't ingest new data.
To stop the cluster, at the top of theOverviewtab, selectStop.

Note
When the cluster is stopped, data is not available for queries, and you can't ingest new data.
To restart the cluster, at the top of theOverviewtab, selectStart.When the cluster is restarted, it takes about 10 minutes for it to become available (like when it was originally provisioned). It takes more time for data to load into the hot cache.

UnderDatabases, select the trash icon next to the database you'd like to delete.
UnderDatabases, select the trash icon next to the database you'd like to delete.
If you plan to follow other quickstarts and tutorials, keep the resources you created. Otherwise, clean up your resource group, to avoid incurring costs.
In the Azure portal, selectResource groupson the far left, and then select the resource group that contains your Data Explorer cluster.
