Get started with Azure Load Balancer by using the Azure portal to create an internal load balancer for a backend pool with two virtual machines. Other resources include Azure Bastion, NAT Gateway, a virtual network, and the required subnets.

Note
In this example you'll create a NAT gateway to provide outbound Internet access. The outbound rules tab in the configuration is bypassed and isn't needed with the NAT gateway. For more information on Azure NAT gateway, seeWhat is Azure Virtual Network NAT?For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeSource Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create NAT gateway
In this section, you create a NAT gateway for outbound internet access for resources in the virtual network. For other options for outbound rules, check outNetwork Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections

Create a virtual network and bastion host
In this section, you create a virtual network with a resource subnet, an Azure Bastion subnet, and an Azure Bastion host.
Important
Hourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

These VMs are added to the backend pool of the load balancer that was created earlier.

Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.

Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the resource group, load balancer, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource groupload-balancer-rgthat contains the resources and then selectDelete.
