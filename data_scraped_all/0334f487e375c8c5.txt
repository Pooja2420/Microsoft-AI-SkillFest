This feature is currently in preview. TheSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsinclude more legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article provides an overview of the mechanisms available to manage access for HDInsight on AKS cluster pools and clusters.
It also covers how to assign permission to users, groups, user-assigned managed identity, and service principals to enable access to cluster data plane.
When a user creates a cluster, then that user is authorized to perform the operations with data accessible to the cluster. However, to allow other users to execute queries and jobs on the cluster, access to cluster data plane is required.
Manage cluster pool or cluster access (Control plane)
The following HDInsight on AKS and Azure built-in roles are available for cluster management to manage the cluster pool or cluster resources.
You can use Access control (IAM) blade to manage the access for cluster poolâs and  control plane.
Refer:Grant a user access to Azure resources using the Azure portal - Azure RBAC.
Manage cluster access (Data plane)
This access enables you to do the following actions:
View clusters and manage jobs.
All the monitoring and management operations.
To enable auto scale and update the node count.
The access is restricted for:
Cluster deletion.
To assign permission to users, groups, user-assigned managed identity, and service principals to enable access to clusterâs data plane, the following options are available:
Azure portal
ARM template
Using Azure portal
The following steps describe how to provide access to other users, groups, user-assigned managed identity, and service principals.
Navigate to theCluster accessblade of your cluster in the Azure portal and clickAdd.
Navigate to theCluster accessblade of your cluster in the Azure portal and clickAdd.

Search for the user/group/user-assigned managed identity/service principal to grant access and clickAdd.
Search for the user/group/user-assigned managed identity/service principal to grant access and clickAdd.

Select the members to be removed and clickRemove.
