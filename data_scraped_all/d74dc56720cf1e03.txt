Security in AKS on Windows Server involves securing the infrastructure and the applications running on the Kubernetes cluster. AKS on Windows Server supports hybrid deployment options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This article describes the security-hardening measures and the built-in security features used to secure the infrastructure and the applications on Kubernetes clusters.
Infrastructure security
AKS on Windows Server applies various security measures to secure its infrastructure. The following diagram highlights these measures:

The following table describes the security-hardening aspects of AKS on Windows Server that are shown in the previous diagram. For conceptual background information on the infrastructure for an AKS deployment, seeClusters and workloads.
Application security
The following table describes the different application security options available in AKS on Windows Server:
Note
You have the option to use the open source application-hardening options available in the open source ecosystem you choose.
