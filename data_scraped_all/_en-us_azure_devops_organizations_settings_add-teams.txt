This article explains how to create new teams, add members, configure team settings, and follow best practices for team management in Azure DevOps.
As your organization grows, add teams to manage specific products, services, or feature areas. Equip teams with tools to manage backlogs, plan sprints, configure dashboards, define alerts, and set team favorites.
Each new project includes a default team named after the project that you can rename or reassign as needed.
To maintain Agile practices while scaling teams, reviewScale Agile to Large Teams. For more information on team-configurable tools, seeAbout teams and Agile tools.
Note
This article explains how to add teams or team members to an Azure DevOps project. For information on Microsoft Teams or integrating it with Azure Boards, seeWelcome to Microsoft TeamsorUse the Azure Boards app in Microsoft Teams.
To move work items between teams, seeMove work items from one team to another.
Prerequisites

Create a team and add team members
To create a team, do the following steps.
Note
When you create a team, you can automatically generate theArea Pathas a child node of the main project. To establish a hierarchical team structure, first define theArea Pathsat the project level, then create your teams, and assign the appropriateArea Pathsto each team. For more information, seeConfigure a hierarchy of teams.
From the Azure CLI tool, you canlist teams,create a team,update a team configuration, anddelete a team.
Note
To enable the new user interface for managing teams, enable theNew Teams Pagefrom thePreview featurestool. To learn how, seeManage or enable features.

Azure DevOps CLI commands aren't supported for Azure DevOps Server.
Upon creation of a team, the following items are automatically configured:
Security group with the team name containing the members assigned to the team, for example,[Fabrikam Fiber]\Production Planning. You can use this name to filter queries or to@mentionall members of the team.
Default notifications assigned to the team. For more information, seeManage notifications for a team, project, or organization.
Default dashboard namedOverviewassigned to the team. To configure the dashboard, seeAdd widgets to a dashboard.
Important
Configuring theArea PathsandIteration Pathsused by the team is essential for many of the Azure Board tools to work, such as Backlogs, Boards, Sprints, and Delivery Plans. Team tools aren't available until the team's default area path is set.Area PathsandIteration Pathsare first configured for the project and then assigned or selected by the team.
If you are moving from one team to two or more teams, you may want to review and revise theArea Pathsassigned to the default project team.
To configure other team features, seeManage teams and configure team tools.

Set the default project team
Each project has a default team assigned. You can change which project is assigned as the default with the following procedures.

az devops team list [--project]
                    [--skip]
                    [--top]
Tip
If you don't specify atopnumber, 100 teams are returned. To list all teams in a project, specify a number fortopwhich is greater than the current number of teams defined.
project: Optional. Name or ID of the project. Example: --project "Fabrikam Fiber."  You can configure the default project usingaz devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID. Required if not configured as default or picked up via git config.
az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID
skip: Optional. Number of teams to skip.
top: Optional. Maximum number of teams to return.
For example, the following command returns the 11 teams defined in the Fabrikam Fiber project. For addition output formats, seeOutput formats for Azure CLI commands.
Each team is assigned a unique ID.
az devops team list --project "Fabrikam Fiber" --output table
az devops team list --project "Fabrikam Fiber" --output table
The following table output provides information on each of the attributes defined for the team.

Grant team members permissions
For teams to work autonomously, give them permissions that they don't have by default. Suggested tasks include providing team administrators or team leads permissions to:
Create and edit child nodes under their default area path
Create shared queries and folders under theShared Queriesfolder
For more information on setting permissions and access for select users, seeSet permissions and access for work tracking.
If your deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you need toGrant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports to team members.
