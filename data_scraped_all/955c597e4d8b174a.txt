APPLIES TO:Python SDK azure-ai-mlv2 (current)
In this article, learn how to run your Keras training scripts using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2.
The example code in this article uses Azure Machine Learning to train, register, and deploy a Keras model built using the TensorFlow backend. The model, a deep neural network (DNN) built with theKeras Python libraryrunning on top ofTensorFlow, classifies handwritten digits from the popularMNIST dataset.
Keras is a high-level neural network API capable of running top of other popular DNN frameworks to simplify development. With Azure Machine Learning, you can rapidly scale out training jobs using elastic cloud compute resources. You can also track your training runs, version models, deploy models, and much more.
Whether you're developing a Keras model from the ground-up or you're bringing an existing model into the cloud, Azure Machine Learning can help you build production-ready models.
Note
If you are using the Keras APItf.kerasbuilt into TensorFlow and not the standalone Keras package, refer instead toTrain TensorFlow models.

Before you can run the code in this article to create a GPU cluster, you'll need torequest a quota increasefor your workspace.
Set up the job
This section sets up the job for training by loading the required Python packages, connecting to a workspace, creating a compute resource to run a command job, and creating an environment to run the job.
Connect to the workspace
First, you'll need to connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. TheAzure Machine Learning workspaceis the top-level resource for the service. It provides you with a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning.
We're usingDefaultAzureCredentialto get access to the workspace. This credential should be capable of handling most Azure SDK authentication scenarios.
DefaultAzureCredential
IfDefaultAzureCredentialdoesn't work for you, seeazure-identity reference documentationorSet up authenticationfor more available credentials.
DefaultAzureCredential
azure-identity reference documentation
Set up authentication
# Handle to the workspace
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient

# Authentication package
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
# Handle to the workspace
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient

# Authentication package
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
If you prefer to use a browser to sign in and authenticate, you should uncomment the following code and use it instead.
# Handle to the workspace
# from azure.ai.ml import MLClient

# Authentication package
# from azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredential
# credential = InteractiveBrowserCredential()
# Handle to the workspace
# from azure.ai.ml import MLClient

# Authentication package
# from azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredential
# credential = InteractiveBrowserCredential()
Next, get a handle to the workspace by providing your Subscription ID, Resource Group name, and workspace name. To find these parameters:
Look for your workspace name in the upper-right corner of the Azure Machine Learning studio toolbar.
Select your workspace name to show your Resource Group and Subscription ID.
Copy the values for Resource Group and Subscription ID into the code.
# Get a handle to the workspace
ml_client = MLClient(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id="<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>",
    resource_group_name="<RESOURCE_GROUP>",
    workspace_name="<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>",
)
# Get a handle to the workspace
ml_client = MLClient(
    credential=credential,
    subscription_id="<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>",
    resource_group_name="<RESOURCE_GROUP>",
    workspace_name="<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>",
)
The result of running this script is a workspace handle that you'll use to manage other resources and jobs.
Note
CreatingMLClientwill not connect the client to the workspace. The client initialization is lazy and will wait for the first time it needs to make a call. In this article, this will happen during compute creation.
MLClient
Create a compute resource to run the job
Azure Machine Learning needs a compute resource to run a job. This resource can be single or multi-node machines with Linux or Windows OS, or a specific compute fabric like Spark.
In the following example script, we provision a Linuxcompute cluster. You can see theAzure Machine Learning pricingpage for the full list of VM sizes and prices. Since we need a GPU cluster for this example, let's pick aSTANDARD_NC6model and create an Azure Machine Learning compute.
compute cluster

from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

gpu_compute_target = "gpu-cluster"

try:
    # let's see if the compute target already exists
    gpu_cluster = ml_client.compute.get(gpu_compute_target)
    print(
        f"You already have a cluster named {gpu_compute_target}, we'll reuse it as is."
    )

except Exception:
    print("Creating a new gpu compute target...")

    # Let's create the Azure ML compute object with the intended parameters
    gpu_cluster = AmlCompute(
        # Name assigned to the compute cluster
        name="gpu-cluster",
        # Azure ML Compute is the on-demand VM service
        type="amlcompute",
        # VM Family
        size="STANDARD_NC6s_v3",
        # Minimum running nodes when there is no job running
        min_instances=0,
        # Nodes in cluster
        max_instances=4,
        # How many seconds will the node running after the job termination
        idle_time_before_scale_down=180,
        # Dedicated or LowPriority. The latter is cheaper but there is a chance of job termination
        tier="Dedicated",
    )

    # Now, we pass the object to MLClient's create_or_update method
    gpu_cluster = ml_client.begin_create_or_update(gpu_cluster).result()

print(
    f"AMLCompute with name {gpu_cluster.name} is created, the compute size is {gpu_cluster.size}"
)
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

gpu_compute_target = "gpu-cluster"

try:
    # let's see if the compute target already exists
    gpu_cluster = ml_client.compute.get(gpu_compute_target)
    print(
        f"You already have a cluster named {gpu_compute_target}, we'll reuse it as is."
    )

except Exception:
    print("Creating a new gpu compute target...")

    # Let's create the Azure ML compute object with the intended parameters
    gpu_cluster = AmlCompute(
        # Name assigned to the compute cluster
        name="gpu-cluster",
        # Azure ML Compute is the on-demand VM service
        type="amlcompute",
        # VM Family
        size="STANDARD_NC6s_v3",
        # Minimum running nodes when there is no job running
        min_instances=0,
        # Nodes in cluster
        max_instances=4,
        # How many seconds will the node running after the job termination
        idle_time_before_scale_down=180,
        # Dedicated or LowPriority. The latter is cheaper but there is a chance of job termination
        tier="Dedicated",
    )

    # Now, we pass the object to MLClient's create_or_update method
    gpu_cluster = ml_client.begin_create_or_update(gpu_cluster).result()

print(
    f"AMLCompute with name {gpu_cluster.name} is created, the compute size is {gpu_cluster.size}"
)
Create a job environment
To run an Azure Machine Learning job, you'll need an environment. An Azure Machine Learningenvironmentencapsulates the dependencies (such as software runtime and libraries) needed to run your machine learning training script on your compute resource. This environment is similar to a Python environment on your local machine.
Azure Machine Learning allows you to either use a curated (or ready-made) environment or create a custom environment using a Docker image or a Conda configuration. In this article, you'll create a custom Conda environment for your jobs, using a Conda YAML file.
To create your custom environment, you'll define your Conda dependencies in a YAML file. First, create a directory for storing the file. In this example, we've named the directorydependencies.
dependencies
import os

dependencies_dir = "./dependencies"
os.makedirs(dependencies_dir, exist_ok=True)
import os

dependencies_dir = "./dependencies"
os.makedirs(dependencies_dir, exist_ok=True)
Then, create the file in the dependencies directory. In this example, we've named the fileconda.yml.
conda.yml
%%writefile {dependencies_dir}/conda.yaml
name: keras-env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pip=21.2.4
  - pip:
    - protobuf~=3.20
    - numpy==1.22
    - tensorflow-gpu==2.2.0
    - keras<=2.3.1
    - matplotlib
    - azureml-mlflow==1.42.0
%%writefile {dependencies_dir}/conda.yaml
name: keras-env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - pip=21.2.4
  - pip:
    - protobuf~=3.20
    - numpy==1.22
    - tensorflow-gpu==2.2.0
    - keras<=2.3.1
    - matplotlib
    - azureml-mlflow==1.42.0
The specification contains some usual packages (such as numpy and pip) that you'll use in your job.
Next, use the YAML file to create and register this custom environment in your workspace. The environment will be packaged into a Docker container at runtime.
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

custom_env_name = "keras-env"

job_env = Environment(
    name=custom_env_name,
    description="Custom environment for keras image classification",
    conda_file=os.path.join(dependencies_dir, "conda.yaml"),
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
)
job_env = ml_client.environments.create_or_update(job_env)

print(
    f"Environment with name {job_env.name} is registered to workspace, the environment version is {job_env.version}"
)
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment

custom_env_name = "keras-env"

job_env = Environment(
    name=custom_env_name,
    description="Custom environment for keras image classification",
    conda_file=os.path.join(dependencies_dir, "conda.yaml"),
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
)
job_env = ml_client.environments.create_or_update(job_env)

print(
    f"Environment with name {job_env.name} is registered to workspace, the environment version is {job_env.version}"
)
For more information on creating and using environments, seeCreate and use software environments in Azure Machine Learning.
Configure and submit your training job
In this section, we'll begin by introducing the data for training. We'll then cover how to run a training job, using a training script that we've provided. You'll learn to build the training job by configuring the command for running the training script. Then, you'll submit the training job to run in Azure Machine Learning.
Obtain the training data
You'll use data from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database of handwritten digits. This data is sourced from Yan LeCun's website and stored in an Azure storage account.
web_path = "wasbs://datasets@azuremlexamples.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/"
web_path = "wasbs://datasets@azuremlexamples.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/"
For more information about the MNIST dataset, visitYan LeCun's website.
Prepare the training script
In this article, we've provided the training scriptkeras_mnist.py. In practice, you should be able to take any custom training script as is and run it with Azure Machine Learning without having to modify your code.
The provided training script does the following:
handles the data preprocessing, splitting the data into test and train data;
trains a model, using the data; and
returns the output model.
During the pipeline run, you'll use MLFlow to log the parameters and metrics. To learn how to enable MLFlow tracking, seeTrack ML experiments and models with MLflow.
In the training scriptkeras_mnist.py, we create a simple deep neural network (DNN). This DNN has:
keras_mnist.py
An input layer with 28 * 28 = 784 neurons. Each neuron represents an image pixel.
Two hidden layers. The first hidden layer has 300 neurons and the second hidden layer has 100 neurons.
An output layer with 10 neurons. Each neuron represents a targeted label from 0 to 9.

Build the training job
Now that you have all the assets required to run your job, it's time to build it using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2. For this example, we'll be creating acommand.
command
An Azure Machine Learningcommandis a resource that specifies all the details needed to execute your training code in the cloud. These details include the inputs and outputs, type of hardware to use, software to install, and how to run your code. Thecommandcontains information to execute a single command.

You'll use the general purposecommandto run the training script and perform your desired tasks. Create aCommandobject to specify the configuration details of your training job.

    experiment_name="keras-dnn-image-classify",
    display_name="keras-classify-mnist-digit-images-with-dnn",
)
The inputs for this command include the data location, batch size, number of neurons in the first and second layer, and learning rate. Notice that we've passed in the web path directly as an input.

Submit the job
It's now time to submit the job to run in Azure Machine Learning. This time, you'll usecreate_or_updateonml_client.jobs.
create_or_update
ml_client.jobs
ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(job)
ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(job)
Once completed, the job will register a model in your workspace (as a result of training) and output a link for viewing the job in Azure Machine Learning studio.
Warning
Azure Machine Learning runs training scripts by copying the entire source directory. If you have sensitive data that you don't want to upload, use a.ignore fileor don't include it in the source directory.
What happens during job execution
As the job is executed, it goes through the following stages:
Preparing: A docker image is created according to the environment defined. The image is uploaded to the workspace's container registry and cached for later runs. Logs are also streamed to the job history and can be viewed to monitor progress. If a curated environment is specified, the cached image backing that curated environment will be used.

Scaling: The cluster attempts to scale up if it requires more nodes to execute the run than are currently available.

Tune model hyperparameters
You've trained the model with one set of parameters, let's now see if you can further improve the accuracy of your model. You can tune and optimize your model's hyperparameters using Azure Machine Learning'ssweepcapabilities.
sweep
To tune the model's hyperparameters, define the parameter space in which to search during training. You'll do this by replacing some of the parameters (batch_size,first_layer_neurons,second_layer_neurons, andlearning_rate) passed to the training job with special inputs from theazure.ml.sweeppackage.
batch_size
first_layer_neurons
second_layer_neurons
learning_rate
azure.ml.sweep
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice, LogUniform

# we will reuse the command_job created before. we call it as a function so that we can apply inputs
# we do not apply the 'iris_csv' input again -- we will just use what was already defined earlier
job_for_sweep = job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[25, 50, 100]),
    first_layer_neurons=Choice(values=[10, 50, 200, 300, 500]),
    second_layer_neurons=Choice(values=[10, 50, 200, 500]),
    learning_rate=LogUniform(min_value=-6, max_value=-1),
)
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice, LogUniform

# we will reuse the command_job created before. we call it as a function so that we can apply inputs
# we do not apply the 'iris_csv' input again -- we will just use what was already defined earlier
job_for_sweep = job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[25, 50, 100]),
    first_layer_neurons=Choice(values=[10, 50, 200, 300, 500]),
    second_layer_neurons=Choice(values=[10, 50, 200, 500]),
    learning_rate=LogUniform(min_value=-6, max_value=-1),
)
Then, you'll configure sweep on the command job, using some sweep-specific parameters, such as the primary metric to watch and the sampling algorithm to use.
In the following code, we use random sampling to try different configuration sets of hyperparameters in an attempt to maximize our primary metric,validation_acc.
validation_acc
We also define an early termination policyâtheBanditPolicy. This policy operates by checking the job every two iterations. If the primary metric,validation_acc, falls outside the top ten percent range, Azure Machine Learning will terminate the job. This saves the model from continuing to explore hyperparameters that show no promise of helping to reach the target metric.
BanditPolicy
validation_acc
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import BanditPolicy

sweep_job = job_for_sweep.sweep(
    compute=gpu_compute_target,
    sampling_algorithm="random",
    primary_metric="Accuracy",
    goal="Maximize",
    max_total_trials=20,
    max_concurrent_trials=4,
    early_termination_policy=BanditPolicy(slack_factor=0.1, evaluation_interval=2),
)
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import BanditPolicy

sweep_job = job_for_sweep.sweep(
    compute=gpu_compute_target,
    sampling_algorithm="random",
    primary_metric="Accuracy",
    goal="Maximize",
    max_total_trials=20,
    max_concurrent_trials=4,
    early_termination_policy=BanditPolicy(slack_factor=0.1, evaluation_interval=2),
)
Now, you can submit this job as before. This time, you'll be running a sweep job that sweeps over your train job.
returned_sweep_job = ml_client.create_or_update(sweep_job)

# stream the output and wait until the job is finished
ml_client.jobs.stream(returned_sweep_job.name)

# refresh the latest status of the job after streaming
returned_sweep_job = ml_client.jobs.get(name=returned_sweep_job.name)
returned_sweep_job = ml_client.create_or_update(sweep_job)

# stream the output and wait until the job is finished
ml_client.jobs.stream(returned_sweep_job.name)

# refresh the latest status of the job after streaming
returned_sweep_job = ml_client.jobs.get(name=returned_sweep_job.name)
You can monitor the job by using the studio user interface link that is presented during the job run.
Find and register the best model
Once all the runs complete, you can find the run that produced the model with the highest accuracy.
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Model

if returned_sweep_job.status == "Completed":

    # First let us get the run which gave us the best result
    best_run = returned_sweep_job.properties["best_child_run_id"]

    # lets get the model from this run
    model = Model(
        # the script stores the model as "keras_dnn_mnist_model"
        path="azureml://jobs/{}/outputs/artifacts/paths/keras_dnn_mnist_model/".format(
            best_run
        ),
        name="run-model-example",
        description="Model created from run.",
        type="mlflow_model",
    )

else:
    print(
        "Sweep job status: {}. Please wait until it completes".format(
            returned_sweep_job.status
        )
    )
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Model

if returned_sweep_job.status == "Completed":

    # First let us get the run which gave us the best result
    best_run = returned_sweep_job.properties["best_child_run_id"]

    # lets get the model from this run
    model = Model(
        # the script stores the model as "keras_dnn_mnist_model"
        path="azureml://jobs/{}/outputs/artifacts/paths/keras_dnn_mnist_model/".format(
            best_run
        ),
        name="run-model-example",
        description="Model created from run.",
        type="mlflow_model",
    )

else:
    print(
        "Sweep job status: {}. Please wait until it completes".format(
            returned_sweep_job.status
        )
    )
You can then register this model.
registered_model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(model=model)
registered_model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(model=model)
Deploy the model as an online endpoint
After you've registered your model, you can deploy it as anonline endpointâthat is, as a web service in the Azure cloud.
To deploy a machine learning service, you'll typically need:
The model assets that you want to deploy. These assets include the model's file and metadata that you already registered in your training job.
Some code to run as a service. The code executes the model on a given input request (an entry script). This entry script receives data submitted to a deployed web service and passes it to the model. After the model processes the data, the script returns the model's response to the client. The script is specific to your model and must understand the data that the model expects and returns. When you use an MLFlow model, Azure Machine Learning automatically creates this script for you.
For more information about deployment, seeDeploy and score a machine learning model with managed online endpoint using Python SDK v2.
Create a new online endpoint
As a first step to deploying your model, you need to create your online endpoint. The endpoint name must be unique in the entire Azure region. For this article, you'll create a unique name using a universally unique identifier (UUID).
import uuid

# Creating a unique name for the endpoint
online_endpoint_name = "keras-dnn-endpoint-" + str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]
import uuid

# Creating a unique name for the endpoint
online_endpoint_name = "keras-dnn-endpoint-" + str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]
from azure.ai.ml.entities import (
    ManagedOnlineEndpoint,
    ManagedOnlineDeployment,
    Model,
    Environment,
)

# create an online endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(

print(f"Endpint {endpoint.name} provisioning state: {endpoint.provisioning_state}")
from azure.ai.ml.entities import (

# create an online endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(

    auth_mode="key",
)

endpoint = ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()

print(f"Endpint {endpoint.name} provisioning state: {endpoint.provisioning_state}")
Once you've created the endpoint, you can retrieve it as follows:
endpoint = ml_client.online_endpoints.get(name=online_endpoint_name)

print(
    f'Endpint "{endpoint.name}" with provisioning state "{endpoint.provisioning_state}" is retrieved'
)
endpoint = ml_client.online_endpoints.get(name=online_endpoint_name)

print(
    f'Endpint "{endpoint.name}" with provisioning state "{endpoint.provisioning_state}" is retrieved'
)
Deploy the model to the endpoint
After you've created the endpoint, you can deploy the model with the entry script. An endpoint can have multiple deployments. Using rules, the endpoint can then direct traffic to these deployments.
In the following code, you'll create a single deployment that handles 100% of the incoming traffic. We've specified an arbitrary color name (tff-blue) for the deployment. You could also use any other name such astff-greenortff-redfor the deployment.
The code to deploy the model to the endpoint does the following:
deploys the best version of the model that you registered earlier;
scores the model, using thescore.pyfile; and
score.py
uses the custom environment (that you created earlier) to perform inferencing.
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineDeployment, CodeConfiguration

model = registered_model

# create an online deployment.
blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="keras-blue-deployment",
    endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
    model=model,
    # code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(code="./src", scoring_script="score.py"),
    instance_type="Standard_DS3_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)

blue_deployment = ml_client.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment).result()
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineDeployment, CodeConfiguration

model = registered_model

# create an online deployment.
blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="keras-blue-deployment",
    endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
    model=model,
    # code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(code="./src", scoring_script="score.py"),
    instance_type="Standard_DS3_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)

blue_deployment = ml_client.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment).result()
Note
Expect this deployment to take a bit of time to finish.
Test the deployed model
Now that you've deployed the model to the endpoint, you can predict the output of the deployed model, using theinvokemethod on the endpoint.
invoke
To test the endpoint you need some test data. Let us locally download the test data which we used in our training script.
import urllib.request

data_folder = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data")
os.makedirs(data_folder, exist_ok=True)

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://azureopendatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz",
    filename=os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz"),
)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://azureopendatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz",
    filename=os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz"),
)
import urllib.request

data_folder = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data")
os.makedirs(data_folder, exist_ok=True)

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://azureopendatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz",
    filename=os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz"),
)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://azureopendatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz",
    filename=os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz"),
)
Load these into a test dataset.
from src.utils import load_data

X_test = load_data(os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz"), False)
y_test = load_data(
    os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz"), True
).reshape(-1)
from src.utils import load_data

X_test = load_data(os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz"), False)
y_test = load_data(
    os.path.join(data_folder, "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz"), True
).reshape(-1)
Pick 30 random samples from the test set and write them to a JSON file.
import json
import numpy as np

# find 30 random samples from test set
n = 30
sample_indices = np.random.permutation(X_test.shape[0])[0:n]

test_samples = json.dumps({"input_data": X_test[sample_indices].tolist()})
# test_samples = bytes(test_samples, encoding='utf8')

with open("request.json", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(test_samples)
import json
import numpy as np

# find 30 random samples from test set
n = 30
sample_indices = np.random.permutation(X_test.shape[0])[0:n]

test_samples = json.dumps({"input_data": X_test[sample_indices].tolist()})
# test_samples = bytes(test_samples, encoding='utf8')

with open("request.json", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(test_samples)
You can then invoke the endpoint, print the returned predictions, and plot them along with the input images. Use red font color and inverted image (white on black) to highlight the misclassified samples.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# predict using the deployed model
result = ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
    request_file="./request.json",
    deployment_name="keras-blue-deployment",
)

# compare actual value vs. the predicted values:
i = 0
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 1))

for s in sample_indices:
    plt.subplot(1, n, i + 1)
    plt.axhline("")
    plt.axvline("")

    # use different color for misclassified sample
    font_color = "red" if y_test[s] != result[i] else "black"
    clr_map = plt.cm.gray if y_test[s] != result[i] else plt.cm.Greys

    plt.text(x=10, y=-10, s=result[i], fontsize=18, color=font_color)
    plt.imshow(X_test[s].reshape(28, 28), cmap=clr_map)

    i = i + 1
plt.show()
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# predict using the deployed model
result = ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
    request_file="./request.json",
    deployment_name="keras-blue-deployment",
)

# compare actual value vs. the predicted values:
i = 0
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 1))

for s in sample_indices:
    plt.subplot(1, n, i + 1)
    plt.axhline("")
    plt.axvline("")

    # use different color for misclassified sample
    font_color = "red" if y_test[s] != result[i] else "black"
    clr_map = plt.cm.gray if y_test[s] != result[i] else plt.cm.Greys

    plt.text(x=10, y=-10, s=result[i], fontsize=18, color=font_color)
    plt.imshow(X_test[s].reshape(28, 28), cmap=clr_map)

    i = i + 1
plt.show()
Note
Because the model accuracy is high, you might have to run the cell a few times before seeing a misclassified sample.
Clean up resources
If you won't be using the endpoint, delete it to stop using the resource. Make sure no other deployments are using the endpoint before you delete it.
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(name=online_endpoint_name)
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(name=online_endpoint_name)
Note
Expect this cleanup to take a bit of time to finish.
