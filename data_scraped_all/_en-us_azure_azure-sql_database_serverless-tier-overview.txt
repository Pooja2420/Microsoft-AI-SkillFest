Applies to:Azure SQL Database
Serverless is acompute tierfor single databases in Azure SQL Database that automatically scales compute based on workload demand and bills for the amount of compute used per second. The serverless compute tier also automatically pauses databases during inactive periods when only storage is billed and automatically resumes databases when activity returns. The serverless compute tier is available in theGeneral Purposeservice tier and theHyperscaleservice tier.
Note
Auto-pause and auto-resume are currently only supported in the General Purpose service tier.
Overview
A compute autoscaling range and an auto-pause delay are important parameters for the serverless compute tier. The configuration of these parameters shapes the database performance experience and compute cost.

Performance configuration
Theminimum vCoresandmaximum vCoresare configurable parameters that define the range of compute capacity available for the database. Memory and IO limits are proportional to the vCore range specified.â¯
Theauto-pause delayis a configurable parameter that defines the period of time the database must be inactive before it is automatically paused. The database is automatically resumed when the next sign in or other activity occurs. Alternatively, automatic pausing can be disabled.
Cost
The cost for a serverless database is the summation of the compute cost and storage cost. The storage cost is determined in the same way as in the provisioned compute tier.
When compute usage is between the minimum and maximum limits configured, the compute cost is based on vCore and memory used.
When compute usage is below the minimum limits configured, the compute cost is based on the minimum vCores and minimum memory configured.
When the database is paused, the compute cost is zero and only storage costs are incurred.
For more cost details, seeBilling.
Scenarios
Serverless is price-performance optimized for single databases with intermittent, unpredictable usage patterns that can afford some delay in compute warm-up after idle usage periods. In contrast, theprovisioned compute tieris price-performance optimized for single databases or multiple databases inelastic poolswith higher average usage that cannot afford any delay in compute warm-up.
Scenarios well suited for serverless compute
Single databases with intermittent, unpredictable usage patterns interspersed with periods of inactivity, and lower average compute utilization over time.
Single databases in the provisioned compute tier that are frequently rescaled and customers who prefer to delegate compute rescaling to the service.
New single databases without usage history where compute sizing is difficult or not possible to estimate before deployment in an Azure SQL Database.
Scenarios well suited for provisioned compute
Single databases with more regular, predictable usage patterns and higher average compute utilization over time.
Databases that cannot tolerate performance trade-offs resulting from more frequent memory trimming or delays in resuming from a paused state.
Multiple databases with intermittent, unpredictable usage patterns that can be consolidated into elastic pools for better price-performance optimization.
Compare compute tiers
The following table summarizes distinctions between the serverless compute tier and the provisioned compute tier:
Purchasing model and service tier
The following table describes serverless support based on purchasing model, service tiers, and hardware:
Autoscaling
Scaling responsiveness
Serverless databases are run on a machine with sufficient capacity to satisfy resource demand without interruption for any amount of compute requested, within limits set by the maximum vCores value. Occasionally, load balancing automatically occurs if the machine is unable to satisfy resource demand within a few minutes. For example, if the resource demand is 4 vCores, but only 2 vCores are available, then it can take up to a few minutes to load balance before 4 vCores are provided. The database remains online during load balancing except for a brief period at the end of the operation when connections are dropped.
Memory management
In both the General Purpose and Hyperscale service tiers, memory for serverless databases is reclaimed more frequently than for provisioned compute databases. This behavior is important to control costs in serverless and can impact performance.
Unlike provisioned compute databases, memory from the SQL cache is reclaimed from a serverless database when CPU or active cache utilization is low.
Active cache utilization is considered low when the total size of the most recently used cache entries falls below a threshold, for a period of time.
When cache reclamation is triggered, the target cache size is reduced incrementally to a fraction of its previous size and reclaiming only continues if usage remains low.
When cache reclamation occurs, the policy for selecting cache entries to evict is the same selection policy as for provisioned compute databases when memory pressure is high.
The cache size is never reduced below the minimum memory limit as defined by minimum vCores.
In both serverless and provisioned compute databases, cache entries can be evicted if all available memory is used.
When CPU utilization is low, active cache utilization can remain high depending on the usage pattern and prevent memory reclamation. Also, there can be other delays after user activity stops before memory reclamation occurs due to periodic background processes responding to prior user activity. For example, delete operations and Query Store cleanup tasks generate ghost records that are marked for deletion, but are not physically deleted until the ghost cleanup process runs. Ghost cleanup might involve reading data pages into cache.
The SQL memory cache grows as data is fetched from disk in the same way and with the same speed as for provisioned databases. When the database is busy, the cache is allowed to grow unconstrained while there is available memory.

Disk cache management
In the Hyperscale service tier for both serverless and provisioned compute tiers, each compute replica uses a Resilient Buffer Pool Extension (RBPEX) cache, which stores data pages on local SSD to improve IO performance. However, in the serverless compute tier for Hyperscale, the RBPEX cache for each compute replica automatically grows and shrinks in response to increasing and decreasing workload demand. The maximum size the RBPEX cache can grow to is three times the maximum memory configured for the database. For details on maximum memory and RBPEX auto-scaling limits in serverless, seeserverless Hyperscale resource limits.

Auto-pause and auto-resume
Currently, serverless auto-pausing and auto-resuming are only supported in the General Purpose tier.

Auto-pause
Auto-pausing is triggered if all of the following conditions are true during the auto-pause delay:
Number of sessions = 0
CPU = 0 for user workload running in the user resource pool
An option is provided to disable auto-pausing if desired.
The following features do not support auto-pausing, but do support auto-scaling. If any of the following features are used, then auto-pausing must be disabled and the database remains online regardless of the duration of database inactivity:
Geo-replication (active geo-replicationandfailover groups).
Long-term backup retention(LTR).
The sync database used inSQL Data Sync. Unlike sync databases, hub and member databases support auto-pausing.
DNS aliascreated for the logical server containing a serverless database.
Elastic Jobs, Auto-pause enabled serverless database is not supported as aJob Database. Serverless databases targeted by elastic jobs do support auto-pausing. Job connections resume a database.
Auto-pausing is temporarily prevented during the deployment of some service updates, which require the database be online. In such cases, auto-pausing becomes allowed again once the service update completes.
If auto-pausing is enabled and features that block auto-pausing are not used, but a database does not auto-pause after the delay period, then application or user sessions might be preventing auto-pausing.
To see if there are any application or user sessions currently connected to the database, connect to the database using any client tool, and execute the following query:
SELECT session_id,
       host_name,
       program_name,
       client_interface_name,
       login_name,
       status,
       login_time,
       last_request_start_time,
       last_request_end_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s
INNER JOIN sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups AS wg
ON s.group_id = wg.group_id
WHERE s.session_id <> @@SPID
      AND
      (
          (
          wg.name like 'UserPrimaryGroup.DB%'
          AND
          TRY_CAST(RIGHT(wg.name, LEN(wg.name) - LEN('UserPrimaryGroup.DB') - 2) AS int) = DB_ID()
          )
      OR
      wg.name = 'DACGroup'
      );
SELECT session_id,
       host_name,
       program_name,
       client_interface_name,
       login_name,
       status,
       login_time,
       last_request_start_time,
       last_request_end_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s
INNER JOIN sys.dm_resource_governor_workload_groups AS wg
ON s.group_id = wg.group_id
WHERE s.session_id <> @@SPID
      AND
      (
          (
          wg.name like 'UserPrimaryGroup.DB%'
          AND
          TRY_CAST(RIGHT(wg.name, LEN(wg.name) - LEN('UserPrimaryGroup.DB') - 2) AS int) = DB_ID()
          )
      OR
      wg.name = 'DACGroup'
      );
Tip
After running the query, make sure to disconnect from the database. Otherwise, the open session used by the query prevents auto-pausing.
If the result set is nonempty, it indicates that there are sessions currently preventing auto-pausing.
If the result set is empty, it is still possible that sessions were open, possibly for a short time, at some point earlier during the auto-pause delay period. To check for activity during the delay period, you can useAuditing for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analyticsand examine audit data for the relevant period.
Important
The presence of open sessions, with or without concurrent CPU utilization in the user resource pool, is the most common reason for a serverless database to not auto-pause as expected.

Auto-resume
Auto-resuming is triggered if any of the following conditions are true at any time:
Monitoring, management, or other solutions performing any of these operations trigger auto-resuming. Auto-resuming is also triggered during the deployment of some service updates that require the database be online.
Connectivity
If a serverless database is paused, the first connection attempt resumes the database and returns an error stating that the database is unavailable with error code 40613. Once the database is resumed, re-try the sign-in to establish connectivity. Database clients followingconnection retry logic recommendationsshould not need to be modified. For connection retry logic options and recommendations, see:
Connection retry logic in SqlClient
Connection retry logic in SQL Database using Entity Framework Core
Connection retry logic in SQL Database using Entity Framework 6
Connection retry logic in SQL Database using ADO.NET
Latency
The latency to auto-resume and auto-pause a serverless database is generally order of 1 minute to auto-resume and 1-10 minutes after the expiration of the delay period to auto-pause.
Customer managed transparent data encryption (BYOK)
If usingcustomer managed transparent data encryption(BYOK) and the serverless database is auto-paused when key deletion or revocation occurs, then the database remains in the auto-paused state. In this case, after the database is next resumed, the database becomes inaccessible within approximately 10 minutes. Once the database becomes inaccessible, the recovery process is the same as for provisioned compute databases. If the serverless database is online when key deletion or revocation occurs, then the database also becomes inaccessible within approximately 10 minutes in the same way as with provisioned compute databases.
If usingcustomer-managed transparent data encryption(BYOK), and serverless auto-pausing is enabled, the database is auto-resumed whenever keys are rotated. The database will then be auto-paused when auto-pausing conditions are satisfied.

Create a new serverless database
Creating a new database or moving an existing database into a serverless compute tier follows the same pattern as creating a new database in provisioned compute tier and involves the following two steps:
Specify the service objective. The service objective prescribes the service tier, hardware configuration, and maximum vCores. For service objective options, seeserverless resource limits

Monitor
Resources used and billed
The resources of a serverless database include the app package, SQL instance, and user resource pool entities.
The app package is the outer most resource management boundary for a database, regardless of whether the database is in a serverless or provisioned compute tier. The app package contains the SQL instance and external services like Full-text Search that all together scope all user and system resources used by a database in SQL Database. The SQL instance generally dominates the overall resource utilization across the app package.
The user resource pool is an inner resource management boundary for a database, regardless of whether the database is in a serverless or provisioned compute tier. The user resource pool scopes CPU and IO for user workload generated by DDL (CREATE and ALTER) and DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE, and SELECT) queries. These queries generally represent the most substantial proportion of utilization within the app package.
Metrics
The following table includes metrics for monitoring the resource usage of the app package and user resource pool of a serverless database, including any geo-replicas:
Pause and resume status
In the case of a serverless database with auto-pausing enabled, the status it reports includes the following values:
In the Azure portal, the database status is displayed in the overview page of the database and in the overview page of its server. Also in the Azure portal, the history of pause and resume events of a serverless database can be viewed in theActivity log.
View the current database status using the following PowerShell example:
Get-AzSqlDatabase -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname -ServerName $servername -DatabaseName $databasename `
  | Select -ExpandProperty "Status"
Get-AzSqlDatabase -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname -ServerName $servername -DatabaseName $databasename `
  | Select -ExpandProperty "Status"
View the current database status using the following Azure CLI example:
az sql db show --name $databasename --resource-group $resourcegroupname --server $servername --query 'status' -o json
az sql db show --name $databasename --resource-group $resourcegroupname --server $servername --query 'status' -o json
Resource limits
For resource limits, seeserverless compute tier.
Billing
The amount of compute billed for a serverless database is the maximum of CPU used and memory used each second. If the amount of CPU and memory used is less than the minimum amount provisioned for each resource, then the provisioned amount is billed. In order to compare CPU with memory for billing purposes, memory is normalized into units of vCores by rescaling the number of  GB by 3 GB per vCore.
Resource billed: CPU and memory
Amount billed: vCore unit price * maximum (minimum vCores, vCores used, minimum memory GB * 1/3, memory GB used * 1/3)
Billing frequency: Per second
The vCore unit price is the cost per vCore per second.
Refer to theAzure SQL Database pricing pagefor specific unit prices in a given region.
The amount of compute billed in serverless for a General Purpose database, or a Hyperscale primary or named replica is exposed by the following metric:
Metric: app_cpu_billed (vCore seconds)
Definition: maximum (minimum vCores, vCores used, minimum memory GB * 1/3, memory GB used * 1/3)
Reporting frequency: Per minute based on per second measurements aggregated over 1 minute.
The amount of compute billed in serverless for Hyperscale HA replicas belonging to the primary replica or any named replica is exposed by the following metric:
Metric: app_cpu_billed_HA_replicas (vCore seconds)
Definition: Sum of maximum (minimum vCores, vCores used, minimum memory GB * 1/3, memory GB used * 1/3) for any HA replicas belonging to their parent resource.
Parent resource and metric endpoint: The primary replica and any named replica each separately expose this metric, which measures the compute billed for any associated HA replicas.
Reporting frequency: Per minute based on per second measurements aggregated over 1 minute.
Minimum compute bill
If a serverless database is paused, then the compute bill is zero. If a serverless database is not paused, then the minimum compute bill is no less than the amount of vCores based on maximum (minimum vCores, minimum memory GB * 1/3).
Examples:
Suppose a serverless database in the General Purpose tier is not paused and configured with 8 maximum vCores and 1 minimum vCore corresponding to 3.0 GB minimum memory. Then the minimum compute bill is based on maximum (1 vCore, 3.0 GB * 1 vCore / 3 GB) = 1 vCore.
Suppose a serverless database in the General Purpose tier is not paused and configured with 4 maximum vCores and 0.5 minimum vCores corresponding to 2.1 GB minimum memory. Then the minimum compute bill is based on maximum (0.5 vCores, 2.1 GB * 1 vCore / 3 GB) = 0.7 vCores.
Suppose a serverless database in the Hyperscale tier has a primary replica with one HA replica and one named replica with no HA replicas. Suppose each replica is configured with 8 maximum vCores and 1 minimum vCore corresponding to 3 GB minimum memory. Then the minimum compute bill for the primary replica, HA replica, and named replica are each based on maximum (1 vCore, 3 GB * 1 vCore / 3 GB) = 1 vCore.
TheAzure SQL Database pricing calculatorfor serverless can be used to determine the minimum memory configurable based on the number of maximum and minimum vCores configured. As a rule, if the minimum vCores configured is greater than 0.5 vCores, then the minimum compute bill is independent of the minimum memory configured and based only on the number of minimum vCores configured.

Scenario examples
General Purpose
Hyperscale
Consider a serverless database in the General Purpose tier configured with 1 minimum vCore and 4 maximum vCores. This configuration corresponds to around 3 GB minimum memory and 12 GB maximum memory. Suppose the auto-pause delay is set to 6 hours and the database workload is active during the first 2 hours of a 24-hour period and otherwise inactive.
In this case, the database is billed for compute and storage during the first 8 hours. Even though the database is inactive starting after the second hour, it is still billed for compute in the subsequent 6 hours based on the minimum compute provisioned while the database is online. Only storage is billed during the remainder of the 24-hour period while the database is paused.
More precisely, the compute bill in this example is calculated as follows:
Suppose the compute unit price is $0.000145/vCore/second. Then the compute billed for this 24-hour period is the product of the compute unit price and vCore seconds billed: $0.000145/vCore/second * 50,400 vCore seconds ~ $7.31.
Consider a serverless database in the Hyperscale tier configured with 1 minimum vCore and 8 maximum vCores. Suppose that the primary replica has enabled one HA replica and that a named replica with 1 minimum vCore and 8 maximum vCores has also been provisioned. For each replica, this configuration corresponds to 3 GB minimum memory and 24 GB maximum memory. Further suppose that write workload occurs throughout a 24-hour period, but that read-only workload occurs just during the first 8 hours of this time period.
In this example, the compute billed for the database is summation of the compute billed for each replica and calculated as follows based on the usage pattern described in the following tables:
Primary replica
Suppose the compute unit price for the primary replica is $0.000105/vCore/second. Then the compute billed for the primary replica over this 24-hour period is the product of the compute unit price and vCore seconds billed: $0.000105/vCore/second * 180000 vCore seconds ~ $18.90.
HA replica
Suppose the compute unit price for an HA replica is $0.000105/vCore/second. Then the compute billed for the HA replica over this 24-hour period is $0.000105/vCore/second * 136,800 vCore seconds ~ $14.36.
Named replica
Similarly for the named replica, suppose the total vCore seconds billed over 24 hours is 150,000 vCore seconds and that the compute unit price for a named replica is $0.000105/vCore/second. Then the compute billed for the named replica over this time period is $0.000105/vCore/second * 150,000 vCore seconds ~ $15.75.
Total compute cost
Therefore, the total compute bill for all three replicas of the database is around $18.90 + $14.36 + $15.75 = $49.01.
