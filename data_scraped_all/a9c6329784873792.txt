Applies to this Azure Well-Architected Framework Operational Excellence checklist recommendation:
This guide describes the recommendations for managing software development practices in accordance with established standards. Your team's ability to produce high quality software relies on a structured, collaborative approach to development planning. Product owners and managers must be able to clearly understand and articulate to stakeholders the work that developers are doing at any time in a development cycle. Conversely, developers must understand the goals of the development cycle via well-written features, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Established standards define how development practices should be performed and allow the workload team to collaborate effectively, reducing the risk of confusion on goals and expectations.
Key design strategies
Formalize your software development practices to help ensure that product owners, project managers, and developers understand the goals of each sprint and deliver consistent quality to stakeholders.
To review guidance on development practices, see thecontinuous integration guide.
Establish collaboration and communication standards
Collaboration: The process of defining proposed changes to the workload should be a collaborative effort. Most changes to the workload will impact multiple functions and/or components, so involving as many workload team members as possible will help ensure that important considerations are not missed and that everyone is aware of the impact on their particular domain. Collaboration also helps clearly define the scope of a change and how to divide the necessary tasks needed to accomplish the change into well-defined work items, as a larger group with expertise across domains will be able to provide experience-backed estimates for the required effort.

Communication: Define the standard protocols for product owners and project managers to promote upcoming releases internally and externally. For example, you might establish a standard for communications to external parties about upcoming releases. The standard might dictate that communication should be sent two weeks before the release and a reminder should be sent 24 hours before the release.

Review: Regularly perform internal audits of your development practices via development cycle retrospectives and postmortems. Process reflection should be blameless and should focus on learning that can be applied as improvements. Ensure that the team reflects on how effective the user story and tasks were in defining the necessary tasks and on the accuracy of time estimates.

Reports: Standardize reports for stakeholders that provide useful metrics focusing on change. Focusing on change allows you to track product acceleration and deceleration. Helpful metrics can include changes in:The monthly growth rate of adoption.Performance.Training time.The frequency of incidents.Reporting shouldn't be used as a tool to evaluate the work of individuals, so avoid metrics like story points or lines of code for each engineer.

Choose industry-standard tools
Use established, industry-proven tools and processes, likeAgile,Scrum, andKanban boards. Developing your own tools and processes is a significant undertaking, taking time and development cycles that could otherwise be spent on your workload. Most experienced DevOps engineers and product owners are familiar with these types of tools and processes, so the learning curve in adopting them should be minimal. Likewise, the onboarding process for new hires will also benefit from using standard tools and processes as they are likely to have a degree of exposure to the same tools and processes already.
Tradeoff: Agile methodology can become too strict if it's overly prescriptive. Strive for a balance between well-defined standards and innovation.
Adopt a standard to capture end user scenarios
User stories: Standardize a template for user stories. Ensure that each user story is a discrete unit of work, written from the perspective of the end user. Well-written user stories should have the following characteristics:Each user story should be wholly independent from each other. Keeping user stories independent of each other avoids any confusion with overlapping work and helps the team understand whether work on a given user story relies on the work on any others, which helps with scheduling and prioritization.Each user story is negotiable. The end user and workload team members' perspectives are both essential to capture realistic user stories that can be accomplished over a short amount of time.User stories are valuable to the end user. When you write user stories from the perspective of the end user, you capture the changes that they are interested in seeing and that will add value to their experience. Keeping this focus as the user story is broken down into work items helps ensure that each deployment provides an improved experience.The effort required for a user story is estimable with a high degree of confidence. Without being able to have a close approximation of the hours required for a given user story, planning will be difficult and the potential for missing deadlines increases, potentially causing cascading effects on other planned work.Well-written user stories are small, so that they can be completed within a few weeks. Smaller scoped stories help keep them estimable and manageable and help keep work items accomplishable.User stories should be testable. Without being able to test that a feature has been delivered, the end user can't have confidence that the goal has been accomplished. Even if a test hasn't been written already for a given user story, there should be a clear understanding of how a test can be developed to prove the delivery of the feature.

Acceptance criteria: Standardize a template for acceptance criteria. Ensure that acceptance criteria relates specifically to the user story and can be unambiguously proven using one or more acceptance tests.

Standardize deployment practices
Deployment: Plan to use frequent small, iterative deployments instead of large infrequent deployments. Using this approach will help keep user stories and work items manageable from a project management standpoint and reduce the risk of large-scale issues when deployments fail.

Tracing: Ensure that the development process is traceable. You should clearly trace the state of your production workload and the associated code back to quality assurance testing, acceptance criteria, user stories, and features. Detailed tracing might also be a regulatory requirement in some cases, like healthcare, for example.
