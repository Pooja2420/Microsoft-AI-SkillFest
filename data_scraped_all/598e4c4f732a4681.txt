In this article
In this article, you add IPv6 support to an existing virtual network. You configure an existing virtual machine with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. When completed, the existing virtual network supports private IPv6 addresses. The existing virtual machine network configuration contains a public and private IPv4 and IPv6 address. You choose from the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to complete the steps in this article.
