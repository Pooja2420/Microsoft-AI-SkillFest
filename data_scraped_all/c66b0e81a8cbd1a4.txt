Azure App Configuration includes feature flags, which you can use to enable or disable a functionality, and variant feature flags, which allow multiple variations of a feature flag.
The Feature manager in the Azure portal provides a UI for creating and managing the feature flags and the variant feature flags that you use in your applications.

It must be unique within an application.KeyBetaYou can use the key to filter feature flags that are loaded in your application. The key is generated from the feature flag name by default, but you can also add a prefix or a namespace to group your feature flags, for example,.appconfig.featureflag/myapp/Beta.LabelLeave emptyYou can use labels to create different feature flags for the same key and filter flags loaded in your application based on the label.

UnderDistribution, Optionally selectUse custom seedand provide a nonempty string as a new seed value. Using a common seed across multiple feature flags allows the same user to be allocated to the same percentile. It is useful when you roll out multiple feature flags at the same time and you want to ensure consistent experience for each segment of your audience. If no custom seed is specified, a default seed is used based on the feature name.
