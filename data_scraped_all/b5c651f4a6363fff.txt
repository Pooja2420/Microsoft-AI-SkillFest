To run specific application workloads, your organization or enterprise needs to design suitable Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) platform-level capabilities. These workloads likely have different storage requirements. When choosing the right storage solution for your application, you have multiple considerations, including performance, availability, recoverability, security, and cost. The goal of this article is to guide you to choose the right option or combination of options for your workload.
Kubernetes can run both stateless and stateful workloads. Stateful workloads often require a storage solution for storing state. AKS supports multiple, integrated options for native storage, which include managed databases, disks (or blocks), and files and blob (or object) storage. Each of these options offers different SKUs, sizes, and performance characteristics. Selecting the right option requires careful consideration.
This article describes the factors and options that you need to consider inSelect the right storage serviceandDesign considerations. It provides specific recommendations inDesign recommendations.
Select the right storage service
Choosing the right SKUs and sizes for your initial deployments requires some evaluations and, potentially, a proof-of-concept or test environment. Following are the high-level guidelines to help you get started with storage for AKS:
Structured data. For structured data that your application can store in a managed database that is available on the platform (for example,Azure SQL), we recommend using a managed database.
Structured data. For structured data that your application can store in a managed database that is available on the platform (for example,Azure SQL), we recommend using a managed database.
Unstructured data. For unstructured dataâsuch as photos, videos, and text documentsâuse blob storage. Your application can do this by using blobs that are mounted as files via Network File System (NFS) or accessed as a virtual file system by usingBlobFuse. Alternatively, your application can read from and write to blob storage directly.

Bandwidth for application & storage requests. Ensure that your nodes have sufficient network bandwidth to handle both application requests and storage requests. Storage traffic goes over the network stack, whether the protocol for transfers is Server Message Block (SMB) or NFS.

Low latency, high IOPS. Use disks for storage if your application needs consistently low latency for messaging applications and high I/O operations per second (IOPS) and high throughput to run your own databases on Kubernetes. For the best performance, consider usingAzure Premium SSD,Azure Premium SSD v2, orAzure Ultra Disk Storage.

Design considerations
The following considerations are for designing storage for AKS. Consider where storage is required in your AKS environment, and determine the best solution for each requirement.
Operating system (OS) disks
For operating system (OS) disks, consider the following factors:
Ephemeral disks for OS. Each virtual machine (VM) in Azure requires a disk for its OS. Because Kubernetes nodes are ephemeral, AKS defaults to using ephemeral OS disks on supported VM sizes. For more information about ephemeral OS disks, seeEphemeral OS.
Ephemeral disks for OS. Each virtual machine (VM) in Azure requires a disk for its OS. Because Kubernetes nodes are ephemeral, AKS defaults to using ephemeral OS disks on supported VM sizes. For more information about ephemeral OS disks, seeEphemeral OS.
Managed disks for OS. If your workload requires them, you can instead use regular managed disks for the nodes in your AKS cluster. Doing so supports workloads that require persistent data on the OS drive. For more information about options for persistent storage, seeStorage options for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Doing so supports workloads that require persistent data on the OS drive.

Sizing managed disks. If you select a managed disk as the OS disk, ensure that it's sized appropriately to support the requirements of the OS, the Kubernetes system, and your workload. For more information about options and differences, seeAzure managed disk types.

Application data
Some workloads need a consistent data store for storage of application data. If your application requires a database, consider exploring the managed databases in Azure, which include the following options:
Azure SQL
Azure Database by MySQL
Azure Database for PostGres
Cosmos DB
Storage solutions in AKS
If a managed database doesn't meet the needs of your application, consider using another storage option that's available to AKS to store consistent data. Options include disk-based solutions, ephemeral disks, files-based solutions, blob storage, and other options that aren't covered in this article.
Disks, or block storage, are ideal for storing data directly on a raw, block-based device. Disk-based storage is ideal for storing data for databases that your Kubernetes cluster hosts. In Azure, managed disks are the solution to get block-based storage.
Static or dynamically created disk storage. Consider whether you want to use a static disk that's created outside of AKS, or if you want AKS to dynamically create the disk storage as a pod or pods require it. Storage that is created dynamically can also be deleted dynamically. For more information, see:Create a static volume with Azure disksDynamically create and use a persistent volume with Azure Disks

Disk size and required performance. Consider whether your managed disk is sized appropriately for your workload's performance requirements. Performance increases as the disk size increases for StandardHDD, Standard SSD, and Premium SSD v1. For more information about managed disks, seeAzure managed disk types.

Performance increases as the disk size increases for StandardHDD, Standard SSD, and Premium SSD v1. For more information about managed disks, seeAzure managed disk types.
Consider whether your application requires non-persistent, temporary storage or where you want to use the high-performance drives in thestorage-optimized VMs. To connect to an ephemeral volume, you can use either theemptyDiroptionin Kubernetes or the driver for aCSI ephemeral local volume. We recommendemptyDirfor ephemeral data, such as scratch space. For storage on the storage-optimized VM series, we recommend using CSI with an ephemeral local volume. For more information about CSI drivers, seeContainer Storage Interface (CSI) drivers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Consider whether your pods need to share a file system. A shared file system is ideal for application and configuration data that is read and shared by multiple pods in your Kubernetes cluster. File storage exposes a shared file system via either NFS or SMB/Common Internet File System (CIFS). Azure has two solutions for file-based storage: Azure Files and Azure NetApp Files.
For Azure Files, consider the following options:
Static or dynamically created file share. Consider whether you want to use a static file share that's created outside of AKS, or if you want AKS to create the file share dynamically on your behalf. For more information, see:Manually create and use a volume with Azure Files shareDynamically create and use a persistent volume with Azure Files

Consider the amount of unstructured data that your application needs to store. Azure Blob storage is accessible via an HTTP API or through the SDKs. Mounting blob storage as a file system into a container or pod is ideal for application workloads that have massive amounts of unstructured data, such as log files, images, documents, streaming media, and disaster-recovery data.
Data redundancy. Consider which data redundancy suits your application. For more information, seeAzure Storage redundancy. Data redundancy is selected at the level of the storage account.
