Azure ExpressRoute enables you to create private connections between Azure data-centers and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet, offering more security, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections.
This article assumes that you have working knowledge of Azure ExpressRoute and are well versed with all of its features. The guidance in this article provides architectural recommendations that are mapped to the principles of theAzure Well-Architected Framework pillars.

concern along with design strategies localized to the technology scope.
Also included arerecommendationson the technology capabilities that can
help materialize those strategies. The recommendations don't represent an
exhaustive list of all configurations available for Azure ExpressRoute and its
dependencies. Instead, they list the key recommendations mapped to the design
perspectives. Use the recommendations to build your proof-of-concept or
optimize your existing environments.

Technology scope
This review focuses on the interrelated decisions for the following Azure resources:
Azure ExpressRoute
Reliability
The purpose of the Reliability pillar is to provide continued functionality bybuilding enough resilience and the ability
to recover fast from failures.
Highly reliable, resilient, and available network connections are fundamental to a well-structured system. Reliability consists of two principles:resiliencyandavailability. Resiliency aims to prevent failures and, if they occur, to restore applications to a fully operational state. Availability ensures consistent access to your applications or workloads. It's important to proactively plan for reliability based on your business needs and application requirements.
TheReliability design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy applied for individual components, system flows, and the system as a whole.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Reliability. Determine its relevance to your business requirements while keeping in mind the features and capabilities of Azure ExpressRoute. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.
Build redundancy, strengthen resiliency:Eliminate single points of failure as much as practical. Plan for redundancy in the network design by configuring multiple ExpressRoute circuits, diverse paths, and multiple peering locations closest to your on-premises locations.
Define availability and recovery targets for the components, the flows, and the overall solution. Visualize the targets to negotiate, gain consensus, set expectations, and drive actions to achieve the ideal state.

Anticipate potential failures:Plan mitigation strategies for potential failures. The following table shows examples of failure mode analysis.FailureMitigationCircuit disruption, such as hardware failure at a peering location.Have a secondary circuit for redundancy while service is restored.  Monitor the health of the circuit to identify when there might be issues.Gateway disruption in the Azure virtual networks.Have your gateway deployed in multiple availability zones, and with Active/Active configuration so that the disruption of the gateway in a single zone does not prevent connectivity.

Plan for site resiliency:Planning for site resiliency is crucial to ensure high availability. ExpressRoute offers three architectures of site resiliency:Standard,High, andMaximum. Standard resiliency provides basic protection against link failures, but does not provide protection against site failures. High resiliency offers enhanced protection with additional failover mechanisms, and Maximum resiliency ensures the highest level of protection with multiple redundant systems and failover mechanisms.
