Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Explore your data from end-to-end in the Azure Data Explorer web application, starting withdata ingestion, runningqueries, and ultimately building dashboards.
A dashboard is a collection of tiles, optionally organized in pages, where each tile has an underlying query and a visual representation. Using the web UI, you can natively export Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to a dashboard as visuals and later modify their underlying queries and visual formatting as needed. In addition to ease of data exploration, this fully integrated Azure Data Explorer dashboard experience provides improved query and visualization performance.
Important
Your data is secure. Dashboards and dashboard-related metadata about users are encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys.
The following image shows a sample Azure Data Explorer dashboard:

To interactively explore sample dashboards, seeQuickstart: Visualize sample data dashboards.
Prerequisites
A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity. An Azure subscription isn't required.

Add tile
Dashboard tiles use Kusto Query Language snippets to retrieve data and render visuals. Each tile/query can support a single visual.

You can also pin a query from thequery tab of the web UI.
To pin a query:
Create and run the query whose output you want to visualize in the dashboard.

Use parameters
Parameters significantly improve dashboard rendering performance, and enable you to use filter values as early as possible in the query. Filtering is enabled when the parameter is included in the query associated with a tile. For more information about how to set up and use different kinds of parameters, seeUse parameters in Azure Data Explorer dashboards.
Tile legend
You can change the position of the legend in your tiles and use the legend to interact with the data.
Change the legend location
If you have edit rights on a dashboard, you can change the location of the legend in your tile. Toggle toEditmode and select theEdit tilepencil icon. In theVisual formattingpane, underLegend, you can select your location preference.
Interact with your data
You can use the legend to interact with the data in your tile. You can change what data you view by selecting the specific item in the legend. UseCtrlto add or remove items from the selection, holdshiftto select a range. Items not selected are greyed out.
TheSearchbutton allows you to search and filter items.
Use theInvertbutton to invert your selection.
TheUpandDownarrows navigate through the list in the following ways:
When one item is selected, the up and down arrows select the previous or next item.
When more than one item is selected, the up and down arrows change which item is highlighted on the tile.

View query
You can view the query in either editing or viewing mode. Editing the underlying query of a tile is only possible in editing mode. In viewing mode, you can modify the query in a new query tab, without changing the underlying query of the dashboard tile.
Browse to your dashboard.

Note
Any edits made to the query using this flow won't be reflected in the original dashboard.
Export dashboards
Use the file menu to export a dashboard to a JSON file. Exporting dashboard can be useful in the following scenarios:
Version control: You can use the file to restore the dashboard to a previous version.
Dashboard template: You can use the file as template for creating new dashboards.
Manual editing: You can edit the file to modify the dashboard. The file can be imported back to the dashboard.
To export a dashboard, in the dashboard, selectFile>Export to file.

The file contains the dashboard data in JSON format, an outline of which is shown in the following snippet.

Enable auto refresh
Auto refresh is a feature that allows you to automatically update the data on a dashboard without manually reloading the page or clicking a refresh button.
The default auto refresh rate can be set by a database editor. Both editors and viewers can change the actual rate of auto refresh while viewing a dashboard.

However, database editors might want to limit the minimum refresh rate that any viewer can set so as to reduce the cluster load. When the minimum refresh rate is set, database users can't set a refresh rate lower than the minimum.
Select theMore menu [...]>Auto refresh.
Select theMore menu [...]>Auto refresh.
