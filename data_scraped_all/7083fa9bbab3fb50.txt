This quickstart steps through creating a SQL Server virtual machine (VM) in the Azure portal. Follow the article to deploy either a conventional SQL Server on Azure VM, or SQL Server deployed to anAzure confidential VM.
Tip
This quickstart provides a path for quickly provisioning and connecting to a SQL VM. For more information about other SQL VM provisioning choices, see theProvisioning guide for SQL Server on Windows VMs in the Azure portal.
If you have questions about SQL Server virtual machines, see theFrequently Asked Questions.

SQL Server settings
On theSQL Server settingstab, configure the following options:
UnderSecurity & Networking, selectPublic (Internet) forSQL Connectivityand change the port to1401to avoid using a well-known port number in the public scenario.

On theReview + createtab, review the summary, and selectCreateto create SQL Server, resource group, and resources specified for this VM.
You can monitor the deployment from the Azure portal. TheNotificationsbutton at the top of the screen shows basic status of the deployment. Deployment can take several minutes.
Connect to SQL Server
In the portal, find thePublic IP addressof your SQL Server VM in theOverviewsection of your virtual machine's properties.

In theConnect to ServerorConnect to Database Enginedialog box, edit theServer namevalue. Enter your VM's public IP address. Then add a comma and add the custom port (1401) that you specified when you configured the new VM. For example,11.22.33.444,1401.

Log in to the VM remotely
Use the following steps to connect to the SQL Server virtual machine with Remote Desktop:
After the Azure virtual machine is created and running, selectVirtual machine, and then choose your new VM.

AfterBastionis deployed successfully, choose the authentication type, enter authentication details, and then selectConnect:

You may need to disable the pop-up blocker in your browser to open the Bastion session in a new browser tab.
After you connect to the SQL Server virtual machine, you can launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect with Windows Authentication using your local administrator credentials. If you enabled SQL Server Authentication, you can also connect with SQL Authentication using the SQL login and password you configured during provisioning.
Access to the machine enables you to directly change machine and SQL Server settings based on your requirements. For example, you could configure the firewall settings or change SQL Server configuration settings.
Clean up resources
If you do not need your SQL VM to run continually, you can avoid unnecessary charges by stopping it when not in use. You can also permanently delete all resources associated with the virtual machine by deleting its associated resource group in the portal. This permanently deletes the virtual machine as well, so use this command with care. For more information, seeManage Azure resources through portal.
Next steps
In this quickstart, you created a SQL Server virtual machine in the Azure portal. To learn more about how to migrate your data to the new SQL Server, see the following article.
