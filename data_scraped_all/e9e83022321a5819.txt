Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure Services (for example, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network.
An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.
For more information, seeWhat is Azure Private Link?
Prerequisites
To integrate a key vault with Azure Private Link, you'll need:
A key vault.
An Azure virtual network.
A subnet in the virtual network.
Owner or contributor permissions for both the key vault and the virtual network.
Your private endpoint and virtual network must be in the same region. When you select a region for the private endpoint using the portal, it will automatically filter only virtual networks that are in that region. Your key vault can be in a different region.
Your private endpoint uses a private IP address in your virtual network.
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Establish a private link connection to Key Vault using the Azure portal
First, create a virtual network by following the steps inCreate a virtual network using the Azure portal
You can then either create a new key vault, or establish a private link connection to an existing key vault.
Create a new key vault and establish a private link connection
You can create a new key vault with theAzure portal,Azure CLI, orAzure PowerShell.
After configuring the key vault basics, select the Networking tab and follow these steps:
Disable public access by toggling off the radio button.
Disable public access by toggling off the radio button.
Select the "+ Create a private endpoint" Button to add a private endpoint.
Select the "+ Create a private endpoint" Button to add a private endpoint.

In the "Location" field of the Create Private Endpoint Blade, select the region in which your virtual network is located.
In the "Location" field of the Create Private Endpoint Blade, select the region in which your virtual network is located.
In the "Name" field, create a descriptive name that will allow you to identify this private endpoint.

You'll now be able to see the configured private endpoint. You can now delete and edit this private endpoint.
Select the "Review + Create" button and create the key vault. It will take 5-10 minutes for the deployment to complete.

When you create a private endpoint, the connection must be approved. If the resource for which you're creating a private endpoint is in your directory, you'll be able to approve the connection request provided you have sufficient permissions; if you're connecting to an Azure resource in another directory, you must wait for the owner of that resource to approve your connection request.
There are four provisioning states:

Validate that the private link connection works
You should validate that the resources within the same subnet of the private endpoint resource are connecting to your key vault over a private IP address, and that they have the correct private DNS zone integration.
First, create a virtual machine by following the steps inCreate a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal
In the "Networking" tab:
Specify Virtual network and Subnet. You can create a new virtual network or select an existing one. If selecting an existing one, make sure the region matches.
Specify a Public IP resource.
In the "NIC network security group", select "None".
In the "Load balancing", select "No".
Open the command line and run the following command:
nslookup <your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net
nslookup <your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net
If you run the ns lookup command to resolve the IP address of a key vault over a public endpoint, you'll see a result that looks like this:
c:\ >nslookup <your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    
Address:  (public IP address)
Aliases:  <your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net
c:\ >nslookup <your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net

Non-authoritative answer:

If you run the ns lookup command to resolve the IP address of a key vault over a private endpoint, you'll see a result that looks like this:

Address:  10.1.0.5 (private IP address)

Troubleshooting Guide
Check to make sure the private endpoint is in the approved state.You can check and fix this in Azure portal. Open the Key Vault resource, and select the Networking option.Then select the Private endpoint connections tab.Make sure connection state is Approved and provisioning state is Succeeded.You may also navigate to the private endpoint resource and review same properties there, and double-check that the virtual network matches the one you're using.
