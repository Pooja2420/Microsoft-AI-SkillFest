In this article, you'll learn how to containerize ASP.NET applications and migrate them toAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS)using the Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool. The containerization process doesn't require access to your codebase and provides an easy way to containerize existing applications. The tool works by using the running state of the applications on a server to determine the application components and helps you package them in a container image. The containerized application can then be deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
The Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool currently supports:
Containerizing ASP.NET apps and deploying them on Windows containers on Azure Kubernetes Service.
Containerizing ASP.NET apps and deploying them on Windows containers on Azure App Service.Learn more.
Containerizing Java Web apps on Apache Tomcat (on Linux servers) and deploying them on Linux containers on AKS.Learn more.

The Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool helps you to:
Discover your application: The tool remotely connects to the application servers running your ASP.NET application and discovers the application components. The tool creates a Dockerfile that can be used to create a container image for the application.
Build the container image: You can inspect and further customize the Dockerfile as per your application requirements and use that to build your application container image. The application container image is pushed to an Azure Container Registry you specify.
Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service:  The tool then generates the Kubernetes resource definition YAML files needed to deploy the containerized application to your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. You can customize the YAML files and use them to deploy the application on AKS.
Note
The Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool helps you discover specific application types (ASP.NET and Java web apps on Apache Tomcat) and their components on an application server. To discover servers and the inventory of apps, roles, and features running on on-premises machines, use Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment capability.Learn more
While all applications won't benefit from a straight shift to containers without significant rearchitecting, some of the benefits of moving existing apps to containers without rewriting include:
Improved infrastructure utilization- With containers, multiple applications can share resources and be hosted on the same infrastructure. This can help you consolidate infrastructure and improve utilization.
Simplified management- By hosting your applications on a modern managed platform like AKS and App Service, you can simplify your management practices. You can achieve this by retiring or reducing the infrastructure maintenance and management processes that you'd traditionally perform with owned infrastructure.
Application portability- With increased adoption and standardization of container specification formats and platforms, application portability is no longer a concern.
Adopt modern management with DevOps- Helps you adopt and standardize on modern practices for management and security and transition to DevOps.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
Set up an Azure account.
Install the Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool.
Discover your ASP.NET application.
Build the container image.
Deploy the containerized application on AKS.
Note
Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario so that you can quickly set up a proof-of-concept. Tutorials use default options where possible, and don't show all possible settings and paths.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, you should:
Prepare an Azure user account
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Once your subscription is set up, you need an Azure user account with:
Owner permissions on the Azure subscription.
Permissions to register Microsoft Entra apps.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription. If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the permissions as follows:
In the Azure portal, search for "subscriptions", and underServices, selectSubscriptions.

InUser settings, verify that Microsoft Entra users can register applications (set toYesby default).ImportantMicrosoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

In case the 'App registrations' settings is set to 'No', request the tenant/global admin to assign the required permission. Alternately, the tenant/global admin can assign theApplication Developerrole to an account to allow the registration of Microsoft Entra App.Learn more.

Parameterize application configurations
Parameterizing the configuration makes it available as a deployment time parameter. This allows you to configure this setting while deploying the application as opposed to having it hard-coded to a specific value in the container image. For example, this option is useful for parameters like database connection strings.

Externalize file system dependencies
You can add other folders that your application uses. Specify if they should be part of the container image or are to be externalized through persistent volumes on Azure file share. Using persistent volumes works great for stateful applications that store state outside the container or have other static content stored on the file system.Learn more.

The tool will create new directories in this Azure file share to copy over the application folders that are configured for Persistent Volume storage. Once the application deployment is complete, the tool will clean up the Azure file share by deleting the directories it had created.If you don't have an Azure file share or would like to create a new Azure file share, you can choose to create on from the tool by selectingCreate new Storage Account and file share.

Download generated artifacts
All artifacts that are used to build and deploy the application into AKS, including the Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML specification files, are stored on the machine running the tool. The artifacts are located atC:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure Migrate App Containerization.
A single folder is created for each application server. You can view and download all intermediate artifacts used in the containerization process by navigating to this folder. The folder, corresponding to the application server, will be cleaned up at the start of each run of the tool for a particular server.
Troubleshoot issues
To troubleshoot any issues with the tool, you can look at the log files on the Windows machine running the App Containerization tool. Tool log files are located atC:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure Migrate App Containerization\Logsfolder.
