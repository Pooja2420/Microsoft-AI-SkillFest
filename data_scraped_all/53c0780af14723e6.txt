In this article
Azure Managed Redis (preview) provides fully integrated and managedRedis Enterpriseon Azure. There are four tiers of Azure Managed Redis (preview), each with different performance characteristics:
Three tiers are for in-memory data:
Memory OptimizedIdeal for memory-intensive use cases that require a high memory-to-vCPU ratio (1:8) but don't need the highest throughput performance. It provides a lower price point for scenarios where less processing power or throughput is necessary, making it an excellent choice for development and testing environments.
Balanced (Memory + Compute)Offers a balanced memory-to-vCPU (1:4) ratio, making it ideal for standard workloads. It provides a healthy balance of memory and compute resources.
Compute OptimizedDesigned for performance-intensive workloads requiring maximum throughput, with a low memory-to-vCPU (1:2) ratio. It's ideal for applications that demand the highest performance.
One tier stores data both in-memory and on-disk:
Flash OptimizedEnables Redis clusters to automatically move less frequently accessed data from memory (RAM) to NVMe storage. This reduces performance, but allows for cost-effective scaling of caches with large datasets.

Prerequisites
You need an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have one, create anaccount.
Availability by region
Azure Managed Redis is continually expanding into new regions. To check the availability by region for all tiers, seeProducts available by region.
Create a Redis instance
To create an Azure Managed Redis (preview) instance, sign in to the Azure portal and selectCreate a resource.

(If the cache name is fewer than 45 characters long it should work in all currently available regions.) The name must start and end with a number or letter, and can't contain consecutive hyphens.
