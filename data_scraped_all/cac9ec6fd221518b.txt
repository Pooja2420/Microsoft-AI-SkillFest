Organize your branches
The defaultMinetab on the branches page shows branches you created, pushed changes to, or set as a favorite, along with the default branch for the repo, such asmain. TheAlltab lists all branches in the repo, and theStaletab lists branches in the repo that don't have any commits for the past three months or longer.
main

If you don't see the branch you're looking for and you think it might be deleted, seeRestore a deleted branch.
Filter the listed branches in any of the branch views by entering a specific name or pattern in theSearch all branchesbox in the upper right.

If your team uses a forward slash separator in your branch names, a collapsible tree view displays for those branches.
Tip
Use a naming convention for your branches. For suggestions, seeAdopt a Git branching strategy.

Mark multiple branches as favorites by selecting the star icon on the tree view next to a folder on the tree.
Remove favorites by toggling the star off or by selecting the...to the right of the star to open the branch context menu, then selectingRemove from my favorites.


Review updates to your branches
Each branch name has the name of the last contributor to the branch and a link to the latest commit on the branch. Select the date or time of the last commit to review the updates to the branch.
The branch view also shows the number of commits the branch is ahead of and behind the branch labeledCompare. Use this information to quickly check how far a branch diverged from another.
If the branch has a pull request open, you can see its pull request ID. Select the pull request to open it, so you can review the details.

Change the compare branch
The "ahead" and "behind" numbers listed for each branch get compared with the branch currently labeledCompareon the Branches page. Update your compare branch to see how far ahead or behind your branches are compared to another branch in your repo:
Select...More actionsfor the branch you want to set as the baseline for comparison.
