When you create a virtual machine (VM), you create avirtual networkor use an existing one. Decide how your virtual machines are intended to be accessed on the virtual network. It's important toplan before creating resourcesand make sure you understand thelimits of networking resources.
In the following figure, virtual machines are represented as web servers and application servers. Each set of virtual machines is assigned to separate subnets in the virtual network.

You can create a virtual network before you create a virtual machine or you can create the virtual network as you create a virtual machine.
You create these resources to support communication with a virtual machine:

Network interfaces
Anetwork interface (NIC)is the interconnection between a virtual machine and a virtual network. A virtual machine must have at least one NIC. A virtual machine can have more than one NIC, depending on the size of the VM you create. To learn about the number of NICs each virtual machine size supports, seeVM sizes.
You can create a VM with multiple NICs, and add or remove NICs through the lifecycle of a VM. Multiple NICs allow a VM to connect to different subnets.
Each NIC attached to a VM must exist in the same location and subscription as the VM. Each NIC must be connected to a virtual network that exists in the same Azure location and subscription as the NIC. The subnet a VM is connected to can be changed after the VM is created. You can't change the virtual network. Each NIC attached to a VM is assigned a MAC address that doesn't change until the VM is deleted.
This table lists the methods that you can use to create a network interface.

IP addresses
You can assign these types ofIP addressesto a network interface in Azure:
Public IP addresses- Used to communicate inbound and outbound (without network address translation (NAT)) with the Internet and other Azure resources not connected to a virtual network. Assigning a public IP address to a NIC is optional. Public IP addresses have a nominal charge, and there's a maximum number that can be used per subscription.

Assigning a public IP address to a NIC is optional. Public IP addresses have a nominal charge, and there's a maximum number that can be used per subscription.
Private IP addresses- Used for communication within a virtual network, your on-premises network, and the Internet (with NAT). At least one private IP address must be assigned to a VM. To learn more about NAT in Azure, readUnderstanding outbound connections in Azure.

You assign IP addresses to a VM using a network interface.
Azure assigns IP addresses dynamically by default. An IP address isn't assigned at creation but is assigned when you create or start a stopped VM. The IP address is released when you stop or delete the VM.
To keep the IP address for the VM the same, set the allocation method to static. The IP address assigns immediately and releases only if you delete the VM or change its allocation method to dynamic.
This table lists the methods that you can use to create an IP address.
-AllocationMethod
--allocation-method
After you create a public IP address, you can associate it with a VM by assigning it to a NIC.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Virtual network and subnets
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. Each NIC in a VM is connected to one subnet in one virtual network. NICs connected to subnets (same or different) within a virtual network can communicate with each other without any extra configuration.
When you set up a virtual network, you specify the topology, including the available address spaces and subnets. Select address ranges that don't overlap if the virtual network is connected to other virtual networks or on-premises networks. The IP addresses are private and can't be accessed from the Internet. Azure treats any address range as part of the private virtual network IP address space. The address range is only reachable within the virtual network, within interconnected virtual networks, and from your on-premises location.
If you work within an organization in which someone else is responsible for the internal networks, talk to that person before selecting your address space. Ensure there's no overlap in the address space. Communicate to them the space you want to use so they don't try to use the same range of IP addresses.
There aren't security boundaries by default between subnets. Virtual machines in each of these subnets can communicate. If your deployment requires security boundaries, useNetwork Security Groups (NSGs), which control the traffic flow to and from subnets and to and from VMs.
This table lists the methods that you can use to create a virtual network and subnets.

Multiple address prefixes on a subnet
Multiple address prefixes on a subnet are a feature that offers the ability to modify IP address spaces on a subnet. With this solution, customers using virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets can add and remove IP address prefixes to meet their scaling requirements.
Limitations:
Customers can only use a single customer address (CA) configuration per NIC.
Customers can only use a single customer address (CA) configuration per NIC.
Customers can only use on VM and Virtual Machine Scale Sets subnets. Delegated subnets aren't supported.

Pricing: Multiple address prefixes on a subnet are offered free of charge.
We welcome you to share your feedback about this feature in thisquick survey.
Important
Multiple prefix support for Azure Virtual Network subnets is currently in public preview.
This preview version has no service level agreement and isn't recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have limited capabilities.
For more information, seeSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.
For more information about how-to configure multiple address prefixes on a subnet, seeCreate multiple prefixes for a subnet.
Important
There are two subnet properties for address space,AddressPrefix(string), andAddressPrefixes(list). The distinction and usage is explained as follows.
The array property was introduced for dual stack. The property is also used for scenarios with more than one subnet prefixes as discussed previously.
As part of the Azure portal customer experience update, theAddressPrefixesis the default property for subnet address space when a subnet is created via the portal.Any new subnets created via portal default to theAddressPrefixeslist parameter.
Any new subnets created via portal default to theAddressPrefixeslist parameter.
If customers are using dual-stack in their virtual network or have more than one subnet prefixes, they're updated to use the list property.For existing deployments using the string, the current behavior is retained unless there are explicit changes in  your virtual network to use the list property for subnet address prefixes. An example is adding IPv6 address space or another prefix to the subnet.
For existing deployments using the string, the current behavior is retained unless there are explicit changes in  your virtual network to use the list property for subnet address prefixes. An example is adding IPv6 address space or another prefix to the subnet.
We recommend that customers should look for both the properties in subnet wherever applicable.
Network security groups
Anetwork security group (NSG)contains a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to subnets, NICs, or both. NSGs can be associated with either subnets or individual NICs connected to a subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all the VMs in that subnet. Traffic to an individual NIC can be restricted by associating an NSG directly to a NIC.
NSGs contain two sets of rules, inbound and outbound. The priority for a rule must be unique within each set.
Each rule has properties of:
Protocol
Protocol
Source and destination port ranges
Source and destination port ranges
Address prefixes
Address prefixes
Direction of traffic
Direction of traffic
Priority
Priority
Access type
Access type
All NSGs contain a set of default rules. You can't delete or override these default rules, as they have the lowest priority and any rules you create can't supersede them.
When you associate an NSG to a NIC, the network access rules in the NSG are applied only to that NIC. If an NSG is applied to a single NIC on a multi-NIC VM, it doesn't affect traffic to the other NICs. You can associate different NSGs to a NIC (or VM, depending on the deployment model) and the subnet that a NIC or VM is bound to. Priority is given based on the direction of traffic.
Be sure toplanyour NSGs when you plan your virtual machines and virtual network.
This table lists the methods that you can use to create a network security group.

Load balancers
Azure Load Balancerdelivers high availability and network performance to your applications. A load balancer can be configured tobalance incoming Internet trafficto VMs orbalance traffic between VMs in a virtual network. A load balancer can also balance traffic between on-premises computers and VMs in a cross-premises network, or forward external traffic to a specific VM.
The load balancer maps incoming and outgoing traffic between:
The public IP address and port on the load balancer.
The public IP address and port on the load balancer.
The private IP address and port of the VM.
The private IP address and port of the VM.
When you create a load balancer, you must also consider these configuration elements:
Front-end IP configurationâ A load balancer can include one or more front-end IP addresses. These IP addresses serve as ingress for the traffic.
Front-end IP configurationâ A load balancer can include one or more front-end IP addresses. These IP addresses serve as ingress for the traffic.
Back-end address poolâ IP addresses that are associated with the NIC to which load is distributed.

Load balancer rules- Maps a given front-end IP and port combination to a set of back-end IP addresses and port combination. A single load balancer can have multiple load-balancing rules. Each rule is a combination of a front-end IP and port and back-end IP and port associated with VMs.

Probes- Monitors the health of VMs. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy VM. The existing connections aren't affected, and new connections are sent to healthy VMs.

Virtual machines
Virtual machines can be created in the same virtual network and they can connect to each other using private IP addresses. Virtual machines can connect if they're in different subnets. They connect without the need to configure a gateway or use public IP addresses. To put VMs into a virtual network, you create the virtual network. As you create each VM, you assign it to the virtual network and subnet. Virtual machines acquire their network settings during deployment or startup.
Virtual machines are assigned an IP address when they're deployed. When you deploy multiple VMs into a virtual network or subnet, they're assigned IP addresses as they boot up. You can also assign a static IP to a VM. If you assign a static IP, you should consider using a specific subnet to avoid accidentally reusing a static IP for another VM.
If you create a VM and later want to migrate it into a virtual network, it isn't a simple configuration change. Redeploy the VM into the virtual network. The easiest way to redeploy is to delete the VM, but not any disks attached to it, and then re-create the VM using the original disks in the virtual network.
This table lists the methods that you can use to create a VM in a virtual network.
NAT Gateway
Azure NAT Gateway simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses. Outbound connectivity is possible without load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines. NAT is fully managed and highly resilient.
Outbound connectivity can be defined for each subnet with NAT. Multiple subnets within the same virtual network can have different NATs. A subnet is configured by specifying which NAT gateway resource to use. All UDP and TCP outbound flows from any virtual machine instance use a NAT gateway.
NAT is compatible with standard public IP address resources or public IP prefix resources or a combination of both. You can use a public IP prefix directly or distribute the public IP addresses of the prefix across multiple NAT gateway resources. NAT grooms all traffic to the range of IP addresses of the prefix. Any IP filtering of your deployments is easier.
NAT Gateway automatically processes all outbound traffic without any customer configuration. User-defined routes aren't necessary. NAT takes precedence over other outbound scenarios and replaces the default Internet destination of a subnet.
Virtual machine scale sets that create virtual machines with Flexible Orchestration mode don't have default outbound access. Azure NAT Gateway is the recommended outbound access method for Virtual machine scale sets Flexible Orchestration Mode.
For more information about Azure NAT Gateway, seeWhat is Azure NAT Gateway?.
This table lists the methods that you can use to create a NAT gateway resource.
Azure Bastion
Azure Bastion is deployed to provide secure management connectivity to virtual machines in a virtual network. Azure Bastion Service enables you to securely and seamlessly RDP & SSH to the VMs in your virtual network. Azure bastion enables connections without exposing a public IP on the VM. Connections are made directly from the Azure portal, without the need of an extra client/agent or piece of software. Azure Bastion supports standard public IP addresses.
Hourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.
