To create a new one, selectCreate newand fill in the name you want to use.IoT hub nameEnter a name for your hub. This name must be globally unique, with a length between 3 and 50 alphanumeric characters. The name can also include the dash ('-') character.RegionSelect the region, closest to you, where you want your hub to be located. Some features, such asIoT Hub device streams, are only available in specific regions. For these limited features, you must select one of the supported regions.TierSelect the tier that you want to use for your hub. Tier selection depends on how many features you want and how many messages you send through your solution per day.The free tier is intended for testing and evaluation. The free tier allows 500 devices to be connected to the hub and up to 8,000 messages per day. Each Azure subscription can create one IoT hub in the free tier.To compare the features available to each tier, selectCompare tiers. For more information, seeChoose the right IoT Hub tier for your solution.Daily message limitSelect the maximum daily quota of messages for your hub. The available options depend on the tier you've selected for your hub. To see the available messaging and pricing options, selectSee all optionsand select the option that best matches the needs of your hub.

Use theaz iot hub createcommand to create an IoT hub in your resource group, using a globally unique name for your IoT hub. For example:
az iot hub create --name <NEW_NAME_FOR_YOUR_IOT_HUB> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --sku S1
az iot hub create --name <NEW_NAME_FOR_YOUR_IOT_HUB> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --sku S1
Important
Because the IoT hub will be publicly discoverable as a DNS endpoint, be sure to avoid entering any sensitive or personally identifiable information when you name it.
The previous command creates an IoT hub in the S1 pricing tier. For more information, seeAzure IoT Hub pricing.
Use theNew-AzIotHubcommand to create an IoT hub in your resource group. The name of the IoT hub must be globally unique. For example:
New-AzIotHub `
    -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> `
    -Name <NEW_NAME_FOR_YOUR_IOT_HUB> `
    -SkuName S1 -Units 1 `
    -Location "<REGION>"
New-AzIotHub `
    -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> `
    -Name <NEW_NAME_FOR_YOUR_IOT_HUB> `
    -SkuName S1 -Units 1 `
    -Location "<REGION>"
Important
Because the IoT hub will be publicly discoverable as a DNS endpoint, be sure to avoid entering any sensitive or personally identifiable information when you name it.
The previous command creates an IoT hub in the S1 pricing tier. For more information, seeAzure IoT Hub pricing.
Connect to an IoT hub
Provide access permissions to applications and services that use IoT Hub functionality.
Connect with a connection string
Connection strings are tokens that grant devices and services permissions to connect to IoT Hub based on shared access policies. Connection strings are an easy way to get started with IoT Hub, and are used in many samples and tutorials, but aren't recommended for production scenarios.
For most sample scenarios, theservicepolicy is sufficient. The service policy grantsService Connectpermissions to access service endpoints. For more information about the other built-in shared access policies, seeIoT Hub permissions.
To get the IoT Hub connection string for theservicepolicy, follow these steps:
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
In theAzure portal, selectResource groups. Select the resource group where your hub is located, and then select your hub from the list of resources.
In theAzure portal, selectResource groups. Select the resource group where your hub is located, and then select your hub from the list of resources.
On the left-side pane of your IoT hub, selectShared access policies.
On the left-side pane of your IoT hub, selectShared access policies.
From the list of policies, select theservicepolicy.
From the list of policies, select theservicepolicy.
Copy thePrimary connection stringand save the value.
Copy thePrimary connection stringand save the value.
Use theaz iot hub connection-string showcommand to get a connection string for your IoT hub that grants the service policy permissions:
az iot hub connection-string show --hub-name <YOUR_IOT_HUB_NAME> --policy-name service
az iot hub connection-string show --hub-name <YOUR_IOT_HUB_NAME> --policy-name service
The service connection string should look similar to the following example:
"HostName=<IOT_HUB_NAME>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED_ACCESS_KEY>"
"HostName=<IOT_HUB_NAME>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED_ACCESS_KEY>"
Use theGet-AzIotHubConnectionStringcommand to get a connection string for your IoT hub that grants the service policy permissions.
Get-AzIotHubConnectionString -ResourceGroupName "<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>" -Name "<YOUR_IOT_HUB_NAME>" -KeyName "service"
Get-AzIotHubConnectionString -ResourceGroupName "<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP>" -Name "<YOUR_IOT_HUB_NAME>" -KeyName "service"
The service connection string should look similar to the following example:
"HostName=<IOT_HUB_NAME>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED_ACCESS_KEY>"
"HostName=<IOT_HUB_NAME>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=<SHARED_ACCESS_KEY>"
Connect with role assignments
Authenticating access by using Microsoft Entra ID and controlling permissions by using Azure role-based access control (RBAC) provides improved security and ease of use over security tokens. To minimize potential security issues inherent in security tokens, we recommend that you enforce Microsoft Entra authentication whenever possible. For more information, seeControl access to IoT Hub by using Microsoft Entra ID.
Delete an IoT hub
When you delete an IoT hub, you lose the associated device identity registry. If you want to move or upgrade an IoT hub, or delete an IoT hub but keep the devices, considermigrating an IoT hub using the Azure CLI.
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
To delete an IoT hub, open your IoT hub in the Azure portal, then chooseDelete.

To delete an IoT hub, run theaz iot hub deletecommand:
az iot hub delete --name <IOT_HUB_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
az iot hub delete --name <IOT_HUB_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
To delete the IoT hub, use theRemove-AzIotHubcommand.
Remove-AzIotHub `
    -ResourceGroupName MyIoTRG1 `
    -Name MyTestIoTHub
Remove-AzIotHub `
    -ResourceGroupName MyIoTRG1 `
    -Name MyTestIoTHub
