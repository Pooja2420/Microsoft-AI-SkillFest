Microsoft Defender for Cloud allows you to configure email notifications for alerts and attack paths. Configuring email notifications allows for the delivery of timely notifications to the appropriate recipients. By modifying the email notification settings, preferences can be defined for the severity levels of alerts and the risk level of attack paths that trigger notifications. By default, subscription owners receive email notifications for high-severity alerts and attack paths.
Defender for Cloud'sEmail notificationssettings page allows you to define preferences for notification emails including:
whoshould be notified- Emails can be sent to select individuals or to anyone with a specified Azure role for a subscription.
whatthey should be notified about- Modify the severity levels for which Defender for Cloud should send out notifications.

Email frequency
To avoid alert fatigue, Defender for Cloud limits the volume of outgoing emails. For each email address, Defender for Cloud sends:
Availability
Required roles and permissions: Security Admin, Subscription Owner or Contributor.
