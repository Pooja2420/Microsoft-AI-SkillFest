When you use Microsoft Azure, you can reliably run your mission-critical SAP workloads and scenarios on a scalable, compliant, and enterprise-proven platform. You get the scalability, flexibility, and cost savings of Azure. With the expanded partnership between Microsoft and SAP, you can run SAP applications across development and test and production scenarios in Azure and be fully supported. From SAP NetWeaver to SAP S/4HANA, SAP BI on Linux to Windows, and SAP HANA to SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, etc., we've got you covered.
Besides hosting SAP NetWeaver and S/4HANA scenarios with the different DBMS on Azure, you can host other SAP workload scenarios, like SAP BI on Azure. Our partnership with SAP resulted in various integration scenarios with the overall Microsoft ecosystem. Check out thededicatedIntegration sectionto learn more.
We just announced our  new services of Azure Center for SAP solutions and Azure Monitor for SAP solutions 2.0 entering the public preview stage. These services give you the possibility to deploy SAP workload on Azure in a highly automated manner in an optimal architecture and configuration. And monitor your Azure infrastructure, OS, DBMS, and ABAP stack deployments on one single pane of glass.
For customers and partners who are focused on deploying and operating their assets in public cloud through Terraform and Ansible, use our SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework to jump start your SAP deployments into Azure using our public Terraform and Ansible modules onGitHub.
Hosting SAP workload scenarios in Azure also can create requirements of identity integration and single sign-on. This situation can occur when you use Microsoft Entra ID to connect different SAP components and SAP software-as-a-service (SaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offers. A list of such integration and single sign-on scenarios with Microsoft Entra ID and SAP entities is described and documented in the section "Microsoft Entra SAP identity integration and single sign-on."
Changes to the SAP workload section
Changes to documents in the SAP on Azure workload section are listed at theend of this article. The entries in the change log are kept for around 180 days.
You want to know
If you have specific questions, we're going to point you to specific documents or flows in this section of the start page. You want to know:
Is Azure accepting new customers for HANA Large Instances? HANA Large Instance service is in sunset mode and doesn't accept new customers anymore. Providing units for existing HANA Large Instance customers is still possible. For alternatives, check the offers of HANA certified Azure VMs in theHANA Hardware Directory.
Can Microsoft Entra accounts be used to run the SAP ABAP stack in Windows guest OS. No, due to shortcomings in feature set of Microsoft Entra ID, it can't be used for running the ABAP stack within the Windows guest OS
What Azure Services, Azure VM types and Azure storage services are available in the different Azure regions, check the siteProducts available by region
Are third-party HA frameworks, besides Windows and Pacemaker supported? Check bottom part ofSAP support note #1928533
What Azure storage is best for my scenario? ReadAzure Storage types for SAP workload
Is the Red Hat kernel in Oracle Enterprise Linux supported by SAP? Read SAPSAP support note #1565179
Why are the AzuresDa(s)v4/Ea(s)VM families not certified for SAP HANA? The Azure Das/Eas VM families are based on AMD processor-driven hardware. SAP HANA doesn't support AMD processors, not even in virtualized scenarios
Why am I still getting the message: 'The cpu flags for the RDTSCP instruction or the cpu flags for constant_tsc or nonstop_tsc aren't set or current_clocksource and available_clocksource aren't correctly configured' with SAP HANA, although I'm running the most recent Linux kernels. For the answer, checkSAP support note #2791572
Where can I find architectures for deploying SAP Fiori on Azure? Check out the blogSAP on Azure: Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) v2 Setup for Internet facing SAP Fiori Apps
