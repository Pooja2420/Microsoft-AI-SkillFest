Subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale within Azure. They play a critical role when you design for large-scale Azure adoption. This article helps you capture subscription requirements and design target subscriptions based on critical factors that vary depending on:
Environment types
Ownership and governance models
Organizational structures
Application portfolios
Regions
Tip
For more information about subscriptions, see the YouTube video:Azure landing zones - How many subscriptions should I use in Azure?
Note
If you use Enterprise Agreements, Microsoft Customer Agreements (Enterprise), or Microsoft Partner Agreements (CSP), review the subscription limits inBilling accounts and scopes in the Azure portal.
Subscription considerations
The following sections contain considerations to help you plan and create subscriptions for Azure.
Organization and governance design considerations
Subscriptions serve as boundaries for Azure Policy assignments.For example, secure workloads like Payment Card Industry (PCI) workloads typically require other policies in order to achieve compliance. Instead of using a management group to collate workloads that require PCI compliance, you can achieve the same isolation with a subscription, without having too many management groups with a few subscriptions.If you need to group together many subscriptions of the same workload archetype, create them under a management group.

Create separate platform subscriptions for management (monitoring), connectivity, and identity when they're required.Establish a dedicated management subscription in your platform management group to support global management capabilities like Azure Monitor Logs workspaces and Azure Automation runbooks.Establish a dedicated identity subscription in your platform management group to host Windows Server Active Directory domain controllers when needed.Establish a dedicated connectivity subscription in your platform management group to host an Azure Virtual WAN hub, private Domain Name System (DNS), Azure ExpressRoute circuit, and other networking resources. A dedicated subscription ensures that all your foundation network resources are billed together and isolated from other workloads.Use subscriptions as a democratized unit of management that aligns with your business needs and priorities.

Use manual processes to limit Microsoft Entra tenants to only Enterprise Agreement enrollment subscriptions. When you use a manual process, you can't create Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscriptions at the root management group scope.For support, submit anAzure support ticket.For information about subscription transfers between Azure billing offers, seeAzure subscription and reservation transfer hub.

Multiple region considerations
Important
Subscriptions aren't tied to a specific region, and you can treat them as global subscriptions. They're logical constructs to provide billing, governance, security, and identity controls for Azure resources that are contained within them. Therefore, you don't need a separate subscription for each region.
You can adopt a multiregion approach at the single workload level for scaling or geo-disaster recovery or at a global level (different workloads in different regions).

A single subscription can contain resources from different regions, depending on the requirements and architecture.

In a geo-disaster recovery context, you can use the same subscription to contain resources from primary and secondary regions because they're logically part of the same workload.

Quota and capacity design considerations
Azure regions might have a finite number of resources. As a result, you should track the available capacity and SKUs for Azure adoptions with several resources.
Considerlimits and quotaswithin the Azure platform for each service that your workloads require.

Consider the availability of required SKUs within your chosen Azure regions. For example, new features might be available only in certain regions. The availability of certain SKUs for given resources like virtual machines (VMs) can vary from one region to another.

Consider that subscription quotas aren't capacity guarantees and are applied on a per-region basis.For virtual machine capacity reservations, seeOn-demand capacity reservation.

Tenant transfer restriction design considerations
Each Azure subscription is linked to a single Microsoft Entra tenant, which acts as an identity provider (IdP) for your Azure subscription. Use the Microsoft Entra tenant to authenticate users, services, and devices.
When any user has the required permissions, they can change the Microsoft Entra tenant that's linked to your Azure subscription. For more information, see:
Associate or add an Azure subscription to your Microsoft Entra tenant
Transfer an Azure subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory
Note
You can't transfer to a different Microsoft Entra tenant for Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscriptions.
For Azure landing zones, you can set requirements to prevent users from transferring subscriptions to your organization's Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information, seeManage Azure subscription policies.
Configure your subscription policy by providing a list ofexempted users. Exempted users are permitted to bypass restrictions that are set in the policy.
Important
An exempted users list isn't anAzure Policy.
Consider whether you should allow users that haveVisual Studio or MSDN Azure subscriptionsto transfer their subscription to or from your Microsoft Entra tenant.

Important
Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

Cost management design considerations
Every large enterprise organization has the challenge of managing cost transparency. This section explores key aspects to achieve cost transparency across large Azure environments.
You might need to share chargeback models, like App Service Environment and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), to achieve higher density. Chargeback models can affect shared platform as a service (PaaS) resources.

When you identify requirements for new subscriptions, reference the following principles:Scale limits: Subscriptions serve as a scale unit for component workloads to scale within platform subscription limits. Large specialized workloads, like high-performance computing, IoT, and SAP, should use separate subscriptions to avoid running up against these limits.Management boundary: Subscriptions provide a management boundary for governance and isolation, which allows a clear separation of concerns. Various environments, such as development, test, and production environments, are often removed from a management perspective.Policy boundary: Subscriptions serve as a boundary for the Azure Policy assignments. For example, secure workloads like PCI workloads typically require other policies in order to achieve compliance. The other overhead doesn't get considered if you use a separate subscription. Development environments have more relaxed policy requirements than production environments.Target network topology: You can't share virtual networks across subscriptions, but you can connect them with different technologies like virtual network peering or ExpressRoute. When you decide if you need a new subscription, consider which workloads need to communicate with each other.

Platform
Avoid a rigid subscription model. Instead, use a set of flexible criteria to group subscriptions across your organization. This flexibility ensures that as your organization's structure and workload composition changes, you can create new subscription groups instead of using a fixed set of existing subscriptions. One size doesn't fit all for subscriptions, and what works for one business unit might not work for another. Some applications might coexist within the same landing zone subscription, while others might require their own subscription.For more information, seeHandle dev/test/production workload landing zones.

Multiple regions recommendations
Create additional subscriptions for each region only if you have region-specific governance and management requirements, for example data sovereignty or to scale beyond quota limits.

If scaling isn't a concern for a geo-disaster recovery environment that spans multiple regions, use the same subscription for the primary and secondary region resources. Some Azure services, depending on the business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy and tools that you adopt, might need to use the same subscription. In an active-active scenario, where deployments are independently managed or have different life cycles, we recommend that you use different subscriptions.

The region where you create a resource group and the region of the contained resources should match so they don't affect resilience and reliability.
