IoT Edge 1.5 LTS is thesupported release. IoT Edge 1.4 LTS is end of life as of November 12, 2024. If you are on an earlier release, seeUpdate IoT Edge.
Use Azure Monitor workbooks to monitor the health and performance of your Azure IoT Edge deployments.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Understand what metrics are shared by IoT Edge devices and how the metrics collector module handles them.
Deploy the metrics collector module to an IoT Edge device.
View curated visualizations of the metrics collected from the device.
Prerequisites
An IoT Edge device with the simulated temperature sensor module deployed to it. If you don't have a device ready, follow the steps inDeploy your first IoT Edge module to a virtual Linux deviceto create one using a virtual machine.
Understand IoT Edge metrics
Every IoT Edge device relies on two modules, theruntime modules, which manage the lifecycle and communication of all the other modules on a device. These modules are called theIoT Edge agentand theIoT Edge hub. To learn more about these modules, seeUnderstand the Azure IoT Edge runtime and its architecture.
Both of the runtime modules create metrics that allow you to remotely monitor how an IoT Edge device or its individual modules are performing. The IoT Edge agent reports on the state of individual modules and the host device, so creates metrics like how long a module has been running correctly, or the amount of RAM and percent of CPU being used on the device. The IoT Edge hub reports on communications on the device, so creates metrics like the total number of messages sent and received, or the time it takes to resolve a direct method. For the full list of available metrics, seeAccess built-in metrics.
These metrics are exposed automatically by both modules so that you can create your own solutions to access and report on these metrics. To make this process easier, Microsoft provides theazureiotedge-metrics-collector modulethat handles this process for those who don't have or want a custom solution. The metrics collector module collects metrics from the two runtime modules and any other modules you may want to monitor, and transports them off-device.
The metrics collector module works one of two ways to send your metrics to the cloud. The first option, which we'll use in this tutorial, is to send the metrics directly to Log Analytics. The second option, which is only recommended if your networking policies require it, is to send the metrics through IoT Hub and then set up a route to pass the metric messages to Log Analytics. Either way, once the metrics are in your Log Analytics workspace, they are available to view through Azure Monitor workbooks.
Create a Log Analytics workspace
A Log Analytics workspace is necessary to collect the metrics data and provides a query language and integration with Azure Monitor to enable you to monitor your devices.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Retrieve your IoT hub resource ID
When you configure the metrics collector module, you give it the Azure Resource Manager resource ID for your IoT hub. Retrieve that ID now.

Deploy the metrics collector module
Deploy the metrics collector module to every device that you want to monitor. It runs on the device like any other module, and watches its assigned endpoints for metrics to collect and send to the cloud.
Follow these steps to deploy and configure the collector module:

After completing the module deployment, you return to the device details page where you can see four modules listed asSpecified in Deployment. It may take a few moments for all four modules to be listed asReported by Device, which means that they've been successfully started and reported their status to IoT Hub. Refresh the page to see the latest status.
Monitor device health
It may take up to fifteen minutes for your device monitoring workbooks to be ready to view. Once you deploy the metrics collector module, it starts sending metrics messages to Log Analytics where they're organized within a table. The IoT Hub resource ID that you provided links the metrics that are ingested to the hub that they belong to. As a result, the curated IoT Edge workbooks can retrieve metrics by querying against the metrics table using the resource ID.
Azure Monitor provides three default workbook templates for IoT:
TheFleet Viewworkbook shows the health of devices across multiple IoT resources. The view allows configuring thresholds for determining device health and presents aggregations of primary metrics, per-device.
TheDevice Detailsworkbook provides visualizations around three categories: messaging, modules, and host. The messaging view visualizes the message routes for a device and reports on the overall health of the messaging system. The modules view shows how the individual modules on a device are performing. The host view shows information about the host device including version information for host components and resource use.
TheAlertsworkbook View presents alerts for devices across multiple IoT resources.
Explore the fleet view and health snapshot workbooks
The fleet view workbook shows all of your devices, and lets you select specific devices to view their health snapshots. Use the following steps to explore the workbook visualizations:

As you continue through the rest of the tutorials, keep the metrics collector module on your devices and return to these workbooks to see how the information changes as you add more complex modules and routing.
