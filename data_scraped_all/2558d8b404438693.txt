The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is an open-source tool that accelerates provisioning and deploying app resources on Azure.azdprovides best practice, developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your development workflow, whether you're working in the terminal, an integrated development environment (IDE), or through CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) pipelines.

azdusesextensible blueprint templatesthat include everything you need to get an application up and running on Azure. These templates include:
azd
Reusable infrastructure as code assets to provision cloud resources services using Bicep or Terraform.
Proof-of-concept or starter app code that can be customized or replaced with your own app code.
Configuration files to handle deploying your app to the provisioned resources.
Optionally, pipeline workflow files for GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines to enable CI/CD integrations.
You can alsocreate your own templateor find one to customize and expand on from theAwesome AZDgallery.

After you installazd, provision and deploy app resources to Azure in only a few steps:

Select anAzure Developer CLI templatesuch as thehello-azddemo template that contains the app resources you want to provision and deploy.

Run theazd initcommand to initialize the template:azd init -t hello-azd

Run theazd upcommand to package, provision and deploy the app resources:azd up

Iterate on the application code and deploy changes as needed by runningazd deploy.

Update Azure resources by modifying the template's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and then runningazd provision.NoteAlternatively, you can also runazd upwhenever you make a changes to your app code or infrastructure files, which handles both provisioning and deploying app resources.
