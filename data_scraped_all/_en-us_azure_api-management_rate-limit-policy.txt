APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
Therate-limitpolicy prevents API usage spikes on a per subscription basis by limiting the call rate to a specified number per a specified time period. When the call rate is exceeded, the caller receives a429 Too Many Requestsresponse status code.
rate-limit
429 Too Many Requests
To understand the difference between rate limits and quotas,see Rate limits and quotas.
Caution
Due to the distributed nature of throttling architecture, rate limiting is never completely accurate. The difference between the configured and the actual number of allowed requests varies based on request volume and rate, backend latency, and other factors.
Note
Set the policy's elements and child elements in the order provided in the policy statement. Learn more abouthow to set or edit API Management policies.

Usage
Policy sections:inbound
Policy scopes:product, API, operation
Gateways:classic, v2, consumption, self-hosted, workspace
Usage notes
This policy can be used only once per policy definition.
This policy is only applied when an API is accessed using a subscription key.
Rate limit counts in a self-hosted gateway can be configured to synchronize locally (among gateway instances across cluster nodes), for example, through Helm chart deployment for Kubernetes or using the Azure portaldeployment templates. However, rate limit counts don't synchronize with other gateway resources configured in the API Management instance, including the managed gateway in the cloud.Learn more
This policy tracks calls independently at each gateway where it is applied, includingworkspace gatewaysand regional gateways in amulti-region deployment. It doesn't aggregate call data across the entire instance.
Example
In the following example, the per subscription rate limit is 20 calls per 90 seconds. After each policy execution, the remaining calls allowed in the time period are stored in the variableremainingCallsPerSubscription.
