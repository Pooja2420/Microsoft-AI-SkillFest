Note
When you enable Change Tracking in the Azure portal using the Azure Monitoring Agent, the process automatically creates a Data Collection Rule (DCR). This rule will appear in the resource group with a name in the format ct-dcr-aaaaaaaaa. After the rule is created, add the required resources.
It usually takes up to two to three minutes to successfully onboard and enable the virtual machine(s). After you enable a virtual machine for change tracking, you can make changes to the files, registries, or software for the specific VM.

To enable the Change Tracking and Inventory on Arc-enabled servers, ensure that the custom Change Tracking Data collection rule is associated to the Arc-enabled VMs.
Follow these steps to associate the data collection rule to the Arc-enabled VMs:

Note
After creating the Data Collection Rule (DCR) using the Azure Monitoring Agent's change tracking schema, ensure that you don't add any Data Sources to this rule. This can cause Change Tracking and Inventory to fail. You must only add new Resources in this section.
