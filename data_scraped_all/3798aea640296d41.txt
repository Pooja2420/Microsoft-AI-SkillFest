This article explains how to attach and detach a lab virtual machine (VM) data disk in Azure DevTest Labs by using the Azure portal. Depending on the VM size, you can create, attach, detach, and reattach multipledata disks. Data disks let you manage storage or software separately from individual VMs.
Prerequisites
To attach or detach a data disk, you must have ownership permissions on the lab VM, and the VM must be running. The VM size determines how many data disks you can attach. For more information, seeSizes for virtual machines.
