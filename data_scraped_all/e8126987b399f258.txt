Collect logs from text files with the Azure Monitor Agent and ingest to Microsoft Sentinel
Article
2024-08-15
2 contributors
Applies to: Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal, Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal
In this article
This article describes how to use theCustom Logs via AMAconnector to quickly filter and ingest logs in text-file format from network or security applications installed on Windows or Linux machines.
Many applications log data to text files instead of standard logging services like Windows Event log or Syslog. You can use the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) to collect data in text files of nonstandard formats from both Windows and Linux computers. The AMA can also effect transformations on the data at the time of collection, to parse it into different fields.
For more information about the applications for which Microsoft Sentinel has solutions to support log collection, seeCustom Logs via AMA data connector - Configure data ingestion to Microsoft Sentinel from specific applications.
For more general information about ingesting custom logs from text files, seeCollect logs from a text file with Azure Monitor Agent.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, you must have the resources configured and the appropriate permissions assigned, as described in this section.
Microsoft Sentinel prerequisites
Install the Microsoft Sentinel solution that matches your application and make sure you have the permissions to complete the steps in this article. You can find these solutions in theContent hubin Microsoft Sentinel, and they all include theCustom Logs via AMAconnector.For the list of applications that have solutions in the content hub, seeSpecific instructions per application. If there isn't a solution available for your application, install theCustom Logs via AMAsolution.For more information, seeDiscover and manage Microsoft Sentinel out-of-the-box content.

Log forwarder prerequisites
Certain custom applications are hosted on closed appliances that necessitate sending their logs to an external log collector/forwarder. In such a scenario, the following prerequisites apply to the log forwarder:
You must have a designated Linux VM as a log forwarder to collect logs.Create a Linux VM in the Azure portal.Supported Linux operating systems for Azure Monitor Agent.
You must have a designated Linux VM as a log forwarder to collect logs.
Create a Linux VM in the Azure portal.
Supported Linux operating systems for Azure Monitor Agent.
If your log forwarderisn'tan Azure virtual machine, it must have the Azure ArcConnected Machine agentinstalled on it.
If your log forwarderisn'tan Azure virtual machine, it must have the Azure ArcConnected Machine agentinstalled on it.
The Linux log forwarder VM must have Python 2.7 or 3 installed. Use thepython --versionorpython3 --versioncommand to check. If you're using Python 3, make sure it's set as the default command on the machine, or run scripts with the 'python3' command instead of 'python'.

The log forwarder must have either thesyslog-ngorrsyslogdaemon enabled.

Your log sources, security devices, and appliances must be configured to send their log messages to the log forwarder's syslog daemon instead of to their local syslog daemon.
Your log sources, security devices, and appliances must be configured to send their log messages to the log forwarder's syslog daemon instead of to their local syslog daemon.
Configure the log forwarder machine's security according to your organization's security policy. For example, configure your network to align with your corporate network security policy and change the ports and protocols in the daemon to align with your requirements. To improve your machine security configuration,secure your VM in Azure, or review thesebest practices for network security.
If your devices are sending logs over TLS because, for example, your log forwarder is in the cloud, you need to configure the syslog daemon (rsyslogorsyslog-ng) to communicate in TLS. For more information, see:
rsyslog
syslog-ng
Encrypt Syslog traffic with TLS â rsyslog
Encrypt log messages with TLS â syslog-ng
Configure the data connector
The setup process for the Custom Logs via AMA data connector includes the following steps:
Create the destination table in Log Analytics (or Advanced Hunting if you're in the Defender portal).The table's name must end with_CLand it must consist of only the following two fields:TimeGenerated(of typeDateTime): the timestamp of the creation of the log message.RawData(of typeString): the log message in its entirety.(If you're collecting logs from a log forwarder and not directly from the device hosting the application, name this fieldMessageinstead ofRawData.)

RawData(of typeString): the log message in its entirety.(If you're collecting logs from a log forwarder and not directly from the device hosting the application, name this fieldMessageinstead ofRawData.)
