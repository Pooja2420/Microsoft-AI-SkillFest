Azure Private endpoint is the fundamental building block for Private Link in Azure. It enables Azure resources, like virtual machines (VMs), to privately and securely communicate with Private Link resources such as Azure Storage.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network and bastion host.
Create a storage account and disable public access.
Create a private endpoint for the storage account.
Create a virtual machine.
Test connectivity to the storage account private endpoint.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create a virtual network and an Azure Bastion host
The following procedure creates a virtual network with a resource subnet, an Azure Bastion subnet, and a Bastion host:
In the portal, search for and selectVirtual networks.
In the portal, search for and selectVirtual networks.

In theAzure Bastionsection, selectEnable Azure Bastion.Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses. The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Bastion?.NoteHourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Note
Virtual machines in a virtual network with a bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in bastion hosted virtual networks. For more information, seeDissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.

The storage access key is required for the later steps. Go to the storage account you created previously and copy the connection string with the access key for the storage account.
