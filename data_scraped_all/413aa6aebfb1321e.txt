Learn how to create, change, or delete a virtual network peering. Virtual network peering enables you to connect virtual networks in the same region and across regions (also known as Global Virtual Network Peering) through the Azure backbone network. Once peered, the virtual networks are still managed as separate resources. If you're new to virtual network peering, you can learn more about it in thevirtual network peering overviewor by completing thevirtual network peering tutorial.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure account with an active subscription,create one for free. Complete one of these tasks before starting the remainder of this article:
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Sign in to theAzure portalwith an Azure account that has thenecessary permissionsto work with peerings.
Either run the commands in theAzure Cloud Shell, or run PowerShell locally from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. In the Azure Cloud Shell browser tab, find theSelect environmentdropdown list, then pickPowerShellif it isn't already selected.
If you're running PowerShell locally, use Azure PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Az.Networkto find the installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module. RunConnect-AzAccountto sign in to Azure with an account that has thenecessary permissionsto work with VNet peerings.

This setting enables communication between hub and spoke in hub-spoke network topology and allows a VM in the peered virtual network to communicate with a VM in 'vnet-1'. TheVirtualNetworkservice tag for network security groups includes the virtual network and peered virtual network when this setting is selected. To learn more about service tags, seeAzure service tags.Allow the peered virtual network to receive forwarded traffic from 'vnet-1`This optionisn't selected by default.- Enabling this option will allow the peered virtual network to receive traffic from virtual networks peered to 'vnet-1'. For example, if vnet-2 has an NVA that receives traffic from outside of vnet-2 that forwards to vnet-1, you can select this setting to allow that traffic to reach vnet-1 from vnet-2. While enabling this capability allows the forwarded traffic through the peering, it doesn't create any user-defined routes or network virtual appliances. User-defined routes and network virtual appliances are created separately.Allow gateway or route server in the peered virtual network to forward traffic to 'vnet-1'This optionisn't selected by default.- Enabling this setting will allow 'vnet-1' to receive traffic from the peered virtual networks' gateway or route server. In order for this option to be enabled, the peered virtual network must contain a gateway or route server.Enable the peered virtual network to use 'vnet-1's' remote gateway or route serverThis optionisn't selected by default.- This option can be enabled only if 'vnet-1' has a remote gateway or route server and 'vnet-1' enables "Allow gateway in 'vnet-1' to forward traffic to the peered virtual network". This option can be enabled in only one of the peered virtual networks' peerings.You can also select this option, if you want this virtual network to use the remote Route Server to exchange routes, seeAzure Route Server.NOTE:You can't use remote gateways if you already have a gateway configured in your virtual network. To learn more about using a gateway for transit, seeConfigure a VPN gateway for transit in a virtual network peering.Local virtual network summaryPeering link nameThe name of the peering from the remote virtual network.

This option can be enabled in only one of 'vnet-1's' peerings.NoteIf you use a Virtual Network Gateway to send on-premises traffic transitively to a peered virtual network, the peered virtual network IP range for the on-premises VPN device must be set to 'interesting' traffic. You may need to add all Azure virtual network's CIDR addresses to the Site-2-Site IPsec VPN Tunnel configuration on the on-premises VPN device. CIDR addresses include resources like such asHub, Spokes, and Point-2-Site IP address pools. Otherwise, your on-premises resources won't be able to communicate with resources in the peered VNet.
Interesting traffic is communicated through Phase 2 security associations. The security association creates a dedicated VPN tunnel for each specified subnet. The on-premises and Azure VPN Gateway tier have to support the same number of Site-2-Site VPN tunnels and Azure VNet subnets. Otherwise, your on-premises resources won't be able to communicate with resources in the peered VNet.  Consult your on-premises VPN documentation for instructions to create Phase 2 security associations for each specified Azure VNet subnet.

When creating a global peering, the peered virtual networks can exist in any Azure public cloud region or China cloud regions or Government cloud regions. You can't peer across clouds. For example, a virtual network in Azure public cloud can't be peered to a virtual network in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet cloud.

When part of a peering, a virtual network cannot be moved. If you need to move a virtual network to a different resource group or subscription, you must delete the peering, move the virtual network, and then recreate the peering.

Resources in one virtual network can't communicate with the front-end IP address of a basic load balancer (internal or public) in a globally peered virtual network. Support for basic load balancer only exists within the same region. Support for standard load balancer exists for both, Virtual Network Peering and Global Virtual Network Peering. Some services that use a basic load balancer don't work over global virtual network peering. For more information, seeConstraints related to Global Virtual Network Peering and Load Balancers.

A peering is established between two virtual networks. Peerings by themselves aren't transitive. If you create peerings between:VirtualNetwork1 and VirtualNetwork2VirtualNetwork2 and VirtualNetwork3There's no connectivity between VirtualNetwork1 and VirtualNetwork3 through VirtualNetwork2. If you want VirtualNetwork1 and VirtualNetwork3 to directly communicate, you have to create an explicit peering between VirtualNetwork1 and VirtualNetwork3, or go through an NVA in theHubnetwork. To learn more, seeHub-spoke network topology in Azure.

Resources in peered virtual networks in the same region can communicate with each other with the same latency as if they were within the same virtual network. The network throughput is based on the bandwidth that's allowed for the virtual machine, proportionate to its size. There isn't any extra restriction on bandwidth within the peering. Each virtual machine size has its own maximum network bandwidth. To learn more about maximum network bandwidth for different virtual machine sizes, seeSizes for virtual machines in Azure.

A virtual network can be peered to another virtual network, and also be connected to another virtual network with an Azure virtual network gateway. When virtual networks are connected through both peering and a gateway, traffic between the virtual networks flows through the peering configuration, rather than the gateway.
