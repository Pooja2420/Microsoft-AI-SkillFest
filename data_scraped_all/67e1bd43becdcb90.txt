Get started with network security perimeter by creating a network security perimeter for an Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal. Anetwork security perimeterallowsAzure PaaS (PaaS)resources to communicate within an explicit trusted boundary. Next, You create and update a PaaS resources association in a network security perimeter profile. Then you create and update network security perimeter access rules. When you're finished, you delete all resources created in this quickstart.
Important
Network Security Perimeter is in public preview and available in all Azure public cloud regions.
This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
For more information, seeSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
An Azure account with an active subscription and access to the Azure portal. If you don't already have an Azure account,create an account for free.
Sign in to the Azure portal
Sign in to theAzure portalwith your Azure account.
Create a resource group and key vault
Before creating a network security perimeter, you create a resource group to hold all resources and a key vault that's protected by a network security perimeter.
Note
Azure Key Vault requires a unique name. If you receive an error that the name is already in use, try a different name. In our example, we use a unique name by appending Year (YYYY), Month (MM), and Day (DD) to the name -key-vault-YYYYDDMM.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterKey vaults. SelectKey vaultsin the search results.

For this quickstart,(US) West Central USis used.

Create a network security perimeter
Once you create a key vault, you can proceed to create a network security perimeter.

Note
If managed identity is not assigned to the resource which supports it, outbound access to other resources within the same perimeter will be denied. Subscription based inbound rules intended to allow access from this resource will not take effect.
Delete a network security perimeter
When you no longer need a network security perimeter and associated resources, you can delete the resource group that contains the network security perimeter and all associated resources. This action removes the network security perimeter and all resources within it.
In the Azure portal, selectResource groupsfrom the left-hand menu.
Selectresource-groupfrom the list of resource groups.
In theresource-groupwindow, selectDelete resource groupfrom the action bar.
In theDelete a resource groupwindow, enter the name of the resource group to confirm the deletion.
SelectDeleteto remove the resource group and all resources within it.
Verify the resource group is no longer listed in theResource groupswindow.
Note
Removing your resource association from the network security perimeter results in access control falling back to the existing resource firewall configuration. This may result in access being allowed/denied as per the resource firewall configuration. If PublicNetworkAccess is set to SecuredByPerimeter and the association has been deleted, the resource will enter a locked down state. For more information, seeTransition to a network security perimeter in Azure.
