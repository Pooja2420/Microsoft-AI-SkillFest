Make sure your target machine:is running asupported operating system.is able to connect through the firewall to communicate over the internet and theseURLsaren't blocked.has VMware tools installed and running.is powered on and the resource bridge has network connectivity to the host running the VM.NoteIf you're using a Linux VM, the account must not prompt for login on sudo commands. To override the prompt, from a terminal, runsudo visudoand add<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALLto the end of the file.  Make sure to replace<username>.If your VM template has these changes incorporated, you won't need to do this for the VM created from that template.
