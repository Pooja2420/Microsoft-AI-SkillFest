Azure Managed Redis (preview)
Azure Managed Redis (preview) is now available to create and use managed caches. Azure Managed Redis runs on theRedis Enterprisestack, which offers significant advantages over the community edition of Redis.
Three tiers are for in-memory data:
Memory OptimizedIdeal for memory-intensive use cases that require a high memory-to-vCPU ratio (1:8) but don't need the highest throughput performance. It provides a lower price point for scenarios where less processing power or throughput is necessary, making it an excellent choice for development and testing environments.
Balanced (Memory + Compute)Offers a balanced memory-to-vCPU (1:4) ratio, making it ideal for standard workloads. This tier provides a healthy balance of memory and compute resources.
Compute OptimizedDesigned for performance-intensive workloads requiring maximum throughput, with a low memory-to-vCPU (1:2) ratio. It's ideal for applications that demand the highest performance.
One tier stores data both in-memory and on-disk:
Flash OptimizedEnables Redis clusters to automatically move less frequently accessed data from memory (RAM) to NVMe storage. This reduces performance, but allows for cost-effective scaling of caches with large datasets.
