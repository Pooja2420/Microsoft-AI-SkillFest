Manual failover is a feature of the IoT Hub service that allows customers tofailovertheir hub's operations from a primary region to the correspondingAzure geo-paired region. Manual failover can be done in the event of a regional disaster or an extended service outage. You can also perform a planned failover to test your disaster recovery capabilities, although we recommend using a test IoT hub rather than one running in production. The manual failover feature is offered to customers at no additional cost for IoT hubs created after May 18, 2017.
In this tutorial, you perform the following tasks:
Using the Azure portal, create an IoT hub.
Perform a failover.
See the hub running in the secondary location.
Perform a failback to return the IoT hub's operations to the primary location.
Confirm the hub is running correctly in the right location.
For more information about manual failover and Microsoft-initiated failover with IoT Hub, seeCross region disaster recovery.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create an IoT hub
This section describes how to create an IoT hub using theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

On theBasicstab, complete the fields as follows:ImportantBecause the IoT hub will be publicly discoverable as a DNS endpoint, be sure to avoid entering any sensitive or personally identifiable information when you name it.PropertyValueSubscriptionSelect the subscription to use for your hub.Resource groupSelect a resource group or create a new one. To create a new one, selectCreate newand fill in the name you want to use.IoT hub nameEnter a name for your hub. This name must be globally unique, with a length between 3 and 50 alphanumeric characters. The name can also include the dash ('-') character.RegionSelect the region, closest to you, where you want your hub to be located. Some features, such asIoT Hub device streams, are only available in specific regions. For these limited features, you must select one of the supported regions.TierSelect the tier that you want to use for your hub. Tier selection depends on how many features you want and how many messages you send through your solution per day.The free tier is intended for testing and evaluation. The free tier allows 500 devices to be connected to the hub and up to 8,000 messages per day. Each Azure subscription can create one IoT hub in the free tier.To compare the features available to each tier, selectCompare tiers. For more information, seeChoose the right IoT Hub tier for your solution.Daily message limitSelect the maximum daily quota of messages for your hub. The available options depend on the tier you've selected for your hub. To see the available messaging and pricing options, selectSee all optionsand select the option that best matches the needs of your hub. For more information, seeIoT Hub quotas and throttling.NotePrices shown are for example purposes only.

Perform a manual failover
Note
There is a limit of two failovers and two failbacks per day for an IoT hub.
Navigate to your IoT hub in the Azure portal.
Navigate to your IoT hub in the Azure portal.
UnderHub settingson the navigation menu, selectFailover.
UnderHub settingson the navigation menu, selectFailover.

On theFailoverpane, you see theCurrent locationand theFailover locationlisted for your IoT hub. The current location always indicates the location in which the hub is currently active. The failover location is the standardAzure geo-paired regionthat is paired to the current location. You cannot change the location values.

At the top of theFailoverpane, selectStart failover.

In the confirmation pane, fill in the name of your IoT hub to confirm it's the one you want to failover. Then, to initiate the failover, selectFailover.The amount of time it takes to perform the manual failover is proportional to the number of devices that are registered for your hub. For example, if you have 100,000 devices, it might take 15 minutes, but if you have five million devices, it might take an hour or longer.While the manual failover process is running, a banner appears to tell you a manual failover is in progress.If you selectOverviewto view the IoT hub details, you see a banner telling you that the hub is in the middle of a manual failover.After it's finished, the current and failover regions on the Manual Failover page are flipped and the hub is active again. In this example, the current location is nowWestCentralUSand the failover location is nowWest US 2.The overview page also shows a banner indicating that the failover is complete and the IoT Hub is running in the paired region.

Perform a failback
After you have performed a manual failover, you can switch the hub's operations back to the original primary region. This action is called afailback. If you have just performed a failover, you have to wait about an hour before you can request a failback. If you try to perform the failback in a shorter amount of time, an error message is displayed.
A failback is performed just like a manual failover. These are the steps:
To perform a failback, return to theFailoverpane for your IoT hub.

To then initiate the failback, selectFailover.After the failback is complete, your IoT hub again shows the original region as the current location and the paired region as the failover location, as you saw originally.

Clean up resources
To remove the resources you've created for this tutorial, delete the resource group. This action deletes all resources contained within the group. In this case, it removes the IoT hub and the resource group itself.
ClickResource Groups.
ClickResource Groups.
Locate and select the resource group that contains your IoT hub.

If you want to delete the entire group and all the resources in it, selectDelete resource group. When prompted, enter the name of the resource group and selectDeleteto confirm the action.If you only want to delete specific resources from the group, check the boxes next to each resource you want to delete then selectDelete. When prompted, typeyesand selectDeleteto confirm the action.
