Each policy definition in Azure Policy has a singleeffectin itspolicyRule. Thateffectdetermines what happens when the policy rule is evaluated to match. The effects behave differently if they are for a new resource, an updated resource, or an existing resource.

The following are the supported Azure Policy definition effects:
addToNetworkGroup
append
audit
auditIfNotExists
deny
denyAction
deployIfNotExists
disabled
manual
modify
mutate
Interchanging effects
Sometimes multiple effects can be valid for a given policy definition. Parameters are often used to specify allowed effect values (allowedValues) so that a single definition can be more versatile during assignment. However, it's important to note that not all effects are interchangeable. Resource properties and logic in the policy rule can determine whether a certain effect is considered valid to the policy definition. For example, policy definitions with effectauditIfNotExistsrequire other details in the policy rule that aren't required for policies with effectaudit. The effects also behave differently.auditpolicies assess a resource's compliance based on its own properties, whileauditIfNotExistspolicies assess a resource's compliance based on a child or extension resource's properties.

Order of evaluation
Azure Policy's first evaluation is for requests to create or update a resource. Azure Policy creates a list of all assignments that apply to the resource and then evaluates the resource against each definition. For aResource Manager mode, Azure Policy processes several of the effects before handing the request to the appropriate Resource Provider. This order prevents unnecessary processing by a Resource Provider when a resource doesn't meet the designed governance controls of Azure Policy. With aResource Provider mode, the Resource Provider manages the evaluation and outcome and reports the results back to Azure Policy.
disabledis checked first to determine whether the policy rule should be evaluated.
disabled
appendandmodifyare then evaluated. Since either could alter the request, a change made might prevent an audit or deny effect from triggering. These effects are only available with a Resource Manager mode.
append
modify
denyis then evaluated. By evaluating deny before audit, double logging of an undesired resource is prevented.

auditis evaluated.

auditIfNotExistsis evaluated.

denyActionis evaluated last.

After the Resource Provider returns a success code on a Resource Manager mode request,auditIfNotExistsanddeployIfNotExistsevaluate to determine whether more compliance logging or action is required.

Layering policy definitions
Several assignments can affect a resource. These assignments might be at the same scope or at different scopes. Each of these assignments is also likely to have a different effect defined. The condition and effect for each policy is independently evaluated. For example:
Policy 1Restricts resource location towestusAssigned to subscription ADeny effect
Restricts resource location towestus
westus
Assigned to subscription A
Deny effect
Policy 2Restricts resource location toeastusAssigned to resource group B in subscription AAudit effect
Restricts resource location toeastus
eastus
Assigned to resource group B in subscription A
Audit effect
This setup would result in the following outcome:
Any resource already in resource group B ineastusis compliant to policy 2 and non-compliant to policy 1
eastus
Any resource already in resource group B not ineastusis non-compliant to policy 2 and non-compliant to policy 1 if not inwestus
eastus
westus
Policy 1 denies any new resource in subscription A not inwestus
westus
Any new resource in subscription A and resource group B inwestusis created and non-compliant on policy 2
westus
If both policy 1 and policy 2 had effect of deny, the situation changes to:
Any resource already in resource group B not ineastusis non-compliant to policy 2
eastus
Any resource already in resource group B not inwestusis non-compliant to policy 1
westus
Policy 1 denies any new resource in subscription A not inwestus
westus
Any new resource in resource group B of subscription A is denied
Each assignment is individually evaluated. As such, there isn't an opportunity for a resource to slip through a gap from differences in scope. The net result of layering policy definitions is considered to becumulative most restrictive. As an example, if both policy 1 and 2 had adenyeffect, a resource would be blocked by the overlapping and conflicting policy definitions. If you still need the resource to be created in the target scope, review the exclusions on each assignment to validate the right policy assignments are affecting the right scopes.
