Remarks
The kubelogin installer task acquires the specified version ofkubeloginfrom the internet or the tools cache and adds it to the PATH of the agent (hosted or private). Use this task to change the version of kubelogin used in subsequent tasks likeKubernetesManifest@1,HelmDeploy@0,AzureFunctionOnKubernetes@1, andKubernetes@1.
AddingKubeloginInstaller@0before the previously listed tasks in a build definition ensures that the desired kubelogin version is available at the time of building, testing and publishing your app.
KubeloginInstaller@0
The tool installer approach also allows you to decouple from the agent update cycles. If the kubelogin version you are looking for is missing from the agent (hosted or private), then you can useKubeloginInstaller@0to get the right version installed on the agent.
