Provide custom authentication to Azure OpenAI Service through a gateway
Intelligent applications that use Azure OpenAI Service through Azure-native services provide seamless user authentication and authorization. However, some scenarios are complex and require different architecture designs. These scenarios include topologies that have client applications that aren't hosted on Azure, use external identity providers, and deploy multiple clients that access the same Azure OpenAI instances. In these scenarios, introducing a gateway in front of Azure OpenAI can significantly improve security by adding a layer that ensures consistent authentication to deployed instances.
This article describes key scenarios that provide authentication to Azure OpenAI:
Authenticate client applications via an external identity provider
Authenticate client applications via an external identity provider
Authenticate client applications via certificates

Authenticate multiple client applications via keys to access a shared Azure OpenAI instance

Each scenario describes the challenges that they introduce and the benefits of incorporating a gateway.

You can use the following guidance for any gateway implementation, including Azure API Management. To illustrate this flexibility, the architecture diagrams use generic representations of components in most scenarios.

Connect directly to Azure OpenAI
If the client applications in these scenarios directly connect to Azure OpenAI without using a gateway, they must use key-based authentication to authenticate to Azure OpenAI. Key-based authentication introduces extra security concerns. You must securely store and rotate keys, and you can't give different clients role-based access control (RBAC) configurations for individual model deployments.
Introduce a gateway

A gateway resolves this scenario's challenges in the following ways:
The gateway uses Open Authorization (OAuth) to authenticate users via their existing external identity providers. The gateway validates the authenticated user access tokens, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT), that the identity provider generates. Then the gateway grants authorization to the backing Azure OpenAI instance.

Recommendations for this scenario
Add more OAuth scopes to your application registration in your identity provider to enable granular permission to consumers. These scopes enable client applications to request permission to perform specific operations in your gateway, includingaccess to Azure OpenAI.

Reasons to avoid a gateway for this scenario
If a single intelligent application accesses Azure OpenAI, it's easier to configure user authentication and authorization within the app rather than through the gateway. Use this approach to assign the necessary Azure RBAC to securely authenticate the intelligent application with Azure OpenAI.
Authenticate client applications via certificates

Connect directly to Azure OpenAI
Azure OpenAI doesn't natively support client certification authentication. To support this scenario without a gateway, the intelligent application needs to use certificate authentication for the user and either an API key or managed identity to authenticate requests to the Azure OpenAI instance. You must implement the certificate authentication logic in every client. In this scenario, key-based authentication introduces risks and management overhead if you connect directly to Azure OpenAI from clients.
Introduce a gateway

You can introduce a gateway into this architecture that offloads client certification validation from the clients. The gatewayvalidates the client digital certificatethat the intelligent application presents and checks the issuer, expiration date, thumbprint, and revocation lists. The gateway should use a managed identity to authenticate itself with Azure OpenAI. The gateway should also use Azure Key Vault to store the root certificate authority (CA). Use this approach to centralize client certificate validation, which reduces maintenance overhead.
A gateway provides several advantages in this scenario:
You use the managed identity of the gateway instead of access keys, which eliminates the risk stolen keys and reduces the maintenance burden of key rotation.

Implement mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) to ensure that both the client and server authenticate each other. This strategy provides an extra layer of security. To configure the gateway to enforce mTLS,  set the appropriate policies and constraints.

Reasons to avoid a gateway for this scenario
In simple environments that have few clients, the cost of handling security and certificate management in the client can outweigh the added complexity of introducing a gateway. Also, gateways can become single points of failure, increase latency because of added layers, and lead to vendor lock-in if you choose commercial solutions rather than custom implementations.
You must carefully assess your specific needs, resource availability, and the criticality of your applications before you implement a gateway for client certificate authentication.

Connect directly to Azure OpenAI
Azure OpenAI supports key-based authentication via shared keys. Azure OpenAI exposes a primary key and a secondary key. The purpose of the secondary key is to support key rotation. It doesn't provide client identity isolation. When you authenticate multiple clients directly to Azure OpenAI in this scenario, each client shares the same key. This implementation has the following challenges:
You can't revoke permissions for specific clients because every client shares the same key.

Enhance monitoring on metrics that are related to API requests. When you use a managed identity from a gateway, the traceability of the user and client application in Azure OpenAI logs doesn't improve. The gateway should provide logging associated with the request, such as the requesting client and user IDs.

When you use a gateway to handle client applications that access multiple Azure OpenAI deployments, you get the same benefits as a gateway that handlesmultiple client applications via keys to access a shared Azure OpenAI instance. You also streamline the authentication process because you use a single user-defined managed identity to authenticate requests from the gateway to multiple Azure OpenAI instances. Implement this approach to reduce overall operational overhead and minimize the risks of client misconfiguration when you work with multiple instances.
An example of how a gateway is being used in Azure to offload identity to an intermediary is the Azure AI Services resource. In that implementation, you authenticate to the gateway, and the gateway handles authenticating to the differing Azure AI services such as Custom Vision or Speech. While that implementation is similar, it does not address this scenario.
Recommendations for this scenario
Implement load balancing techniques to distribute the API requests across multiple instances of Azure OpenAI to handle high traffic and ensure high availability. For more information, seeUse a gateway in front of multiple Azure OpenAI deployments or instances.

Correlate token usage for each tenant at the gateway when you implement multitenant scenarios with multiple Azure OpenAI instances. This approach ensures that you track total token usage, regardless of the back-end Azure OpenAI instance that the request is forwarded to.

General recommendations
When you integrate Azure OpenAI through a gateway, there are several cross-cutting recommendations to consider that apply in all scenarios.
Use Azure API Management instead of creating your own solution for efficient API orchestration, seamless integration with other Azure services, and cost savings by reducing development and maintenance efforts. API Management ensures secure API management by directly supporting authentication and authorization. It integrates with identity providers, such as Microsoft Entra ID, which enables OAuth 2.0 and provides policy-based authorization. Additionally, API Management uses managed identities for secure and low-maintenance access to Azure OpenAI.
Combine scenarios for a comprehensive gateway solution
In real-world applications, your use cases can span multiple scenarios from this article. For example, you might have client applications that authenticate through an external identity provider and require access to multiple Azure OpenAI instances.

To build a gateway that supports your specific requirements, combine the recommendations from these scenarios for a comprehensive approach.
Enforce gateway policies
Before a gateway sends requests to Azure OpenAI instances, make sure you enforce inbound authentication and authorization policies. To ensure that the gateway only forwards authenticated and authorized requests, use user access tokens from an identity provider or certificate validation to implement this approach.
To enable granular control, implement more authorization scoping with roles and permissions for client applications in your gateway. Use these scopes to permit specific operations based on the client application's needs. This approach enhances security and manageability.
For access token validation, be sure to validate all key registered claims such asiss,aud,exp, andnbfand any relevant workload-specific claims such as group memberships or application roles.

Use Azure managed identities
To simplify authentication across all client application scenarios, use Azure managed identities to centralize authentication management. This approach reduces the complexity and risks that are associated with managing multiple API keys or credentials in client applications.
Managed identities inherently support Azure RBAC, so they ensure that the gateway only has the lowest level of permissions necessary to access Azure OpenAI instances. To reduce the risk of unauthorized access and simplify compliance with security policies, combine managed identities with other methods that disable alternative authentication.
Implement comprehensive observability
When you implement a gateway with a managed identity, it reduces traceability because the managed identity represents the gateway itself, not the user or the application that makes the request. Therefore, it's essential to improve observability on metrics that are related to API requests. To maintain visibility over access patterns and usage, gateways should provide more tracing metadata, such as the requesting client and user IDs.
Centralized logging of all requests that pass through the gateway helps you maintain an audit trail. A centralized audit trail is especially important for troubleshooting, compliance, and detecting unauthorized access attempts.
Address caching safely
If your API gateway is responsible for caching completions or other inferencing results, make sure the identity of the requestor is considered in the cache logic. Do not return cached results for identities that are not authorized to receive that data.
Gateway implementations
Azure doesn't provide a complete turnkey solution or reference architecture to build the gateway in this article, so you must build and operate the gateway. Azure API management can be used to build a PaaS based solution through built-in and custom policies. Azure also provides examples of community-supported implementations that cover the use cases in this article. Reference these samples when you build your own gateway solution.
