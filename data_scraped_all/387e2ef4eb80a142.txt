This article teaches you how to configure alinkbetween SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). With the link, databases from your initial primary are replicated to your secondary replica in near-real time.
After the link is created, you can then fail over to your secondary replica for the purpose of migration, or disaster recovery.
Note
It's also possible to configure the link by usingscripts.
Configuring Azure SQL Managed Instance as your initial primary is supported starting withSQL Server 2022 CU10.
Overview
Use the link feature to replicate databases from your initial primary to your secondary replica. For SQL Server 2022, the initial primary can be either SQL Server or Azure SQL Managed Instance. For SQL Server 2019 and earlier versions, the initial primary must be SQL Server. After the link is configured, the database from the initial primary is replicated to the secondary replica.
You can choose to leave the link in place for continuous data replication in a hybrid environment between the primary and secondary replica, or you can fail over the database to the secondary replica, to migrate to Azure, or for disaster recovery. For SQL Server 2019 and earlier versions, failing over to Azure SQL Managed Instance breaks the link and fail back is unsupported. With SQL Server 2022, you have the option to maintain the link and fail back and forth between the two replicas.
If you plan to use your secondary managed instance for only disaster recovery, you can save on licensing costs by activating thehybrid failover benefit.
Use the instructions in this article to manually set up the link between SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance. After the link is created, your source database gets a read-only copy on your target secondary replica.
Prerequisites
To replicate your databases to your secondary replica through the link, you need the following prerequisites:
An active Azure subscription. If you don't have one,create a free account.
Supported version of SQL Serverwith required service update installed.
Azure SQL Managed Instance.Get startedif you don't have it.
SQL Server Management Studio v19.2 or later.
A properlyprepared environment.
Consider the following:
The link feature supports one database per link. To replicate multiple databases from an instance, create a link for each individual database. For example, to replicate 10 databases to SQL Managed Instance, create 10 individual links.
Collation between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance should be the same. A mismatch in collation could cause a mismatch in server name casing and prevent a successful connection from SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance.
Error 1475 on your initial SQL Server primary indicates that you need to start a new backup chain by creating a full backup without theCOPY ONLYoption.
COPY ONLY
To establish a link, or fail over, from SQL Managed Instance to SQL Server 2022, your managed instance must be configured with theSQL Server 2022 update policy. Data replication and failover from SQL Managed Instance to SQL Server 2022 is not supported by instances configured with theAlways-up-to-dateupdate policy.
While you can establish a link from SQL Server 2022 to a SQL managed instance configured with the Always-up-to-date update policy, after failover to SQL Managed Instance, you will no longer be able to replicate data or fail back to SQL Server 2022.
Permissions
For SQL Server, you should havesysadminpermissions.
For Azure SQL Managed Instance, you should be a member of theSQL Managed Instance Contributor, or have the following custom role permissions:
Prepare databases
If SQL Server is your initial primary, you need to create a backup of your database. Since Azure SQL Managed Instance takes backups automatically, skip this step if SQL Managed Instance is your initial primary.
Use SSMS to back up your database on SQL Server. Follow these steps:
Connect to your SQL Server in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
InObject Explorer, right-click the database, hover overTasksand then chooseBack up.
ChooseFullfor backup type.
Ensure theBack up tooption has the backup path to a disk with sufficient free storage space available.
SelectOKto complete the full backup.
For more information, seeCreate a Full Database Backup.
Note
The link supports replicating user databases only. Replication of system databases is not supported. To replicate instance-level objects (stored inmasterormsdb), script them out and run T-SQL scripts on the destination instance.
master
msdb
Create link to replicate database
In the following steps, use theNew Managed Instance linkwizard in SSMS to create a link between your initial primary and your secondary replica.
After you create the link, your source database gets a read-only copy on your target secondary replica.
Open SSMS and connect to your initial primary.
Open SSMS and connect to your initial primary.
InObject Explorer, right-click the database you want to link to the secondary, hover overAzure SQL Managed Instance link, and selectNew...to open theNew Managed Instance linkwizard. If your SQL Server version isn't supported, the option isn't available in the context menu.

Check the boxes if you want to enable connectivity troubleshooting and, for SQL Server 2022, if you plan to use the link for two-way disaster recovery. SelectNext.

View a replicated database
After the link is created, your database is replicated to the secondary replica. Depending on database size and network speed, the database might initially be in aRestoringstate on the secondary replica. After initial seeding finishes, the database is restored to the secondary replica and ready for read-only workloads.
On either replica, useObject Explorerin SSMS to view theSynchronizedstate of the replicated database.

ExpandAlways On High AvailabilityandAvailability Groupsto view the distributed availability group created for each link.

Regardless of which instance is primary, you can also right-click the linked distributed availability group on SQL Server and selectShow Dashboardto view the dashboard for the distributed availability group, which shows the status of the linked database in the distributed availability group.
Take first transaction log backup
If SQL Server is your initial primary, it's important to take the firsttransaction log backupon SQL Serverafterinitial seeding completes, when the database is no longer in theRestoring...state on Azure SQL Managed Instance. Then takeSQL Server transaction log backups regularlyto minimize excessive log growth while SQL Server is in the primary role.
If SQL Managed Instance is your primary, you don't need to take any action as Azure SQL Managed Instance takes log backups automatically.
Drop a link
If you want to drop the link, either because it's no longer needed, or because it's in an irreparable state and needs to be recreated, you can do so with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
You can delete the link from the following menu options inObject Explorerof SSMS, after connecting to your instance:
Always On Availability Groups>Availability Groups> Right-click the distributed availability group name associated with the link >Delete...
Databases> Right-click the database associated with the link >Azure SQL Managed Instance link>Delete...
Troubleshoot
If you encounter an error message when you create the link, select the error to open a window with additional details about the error.
If you encounter an error when working with the link, the SSMS wizard stops execution at the step that failed, and can't be restarted again. Address the issue, and, if necessary, clean up the environment to revert back to the original state by removing the distributed availability group and availability group if it was created while setting up the link. Then launch the wizard again to start over.
