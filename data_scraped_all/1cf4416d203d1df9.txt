The Language Detection feature can evaluate text, and return a language identifier that indicates the language a document was written in.
Language detection is useful for content stores that collect arbitrary text, where language is unknown. You can parse the results of this analysis to determine which language is used in the input document. The response also returns a score between 0 and 1 that reflects the confidence of the model.
The Language Detection feature can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional or cultural languages.
Development options
To use language detection, you submit raw unstructured text for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no additional customization to the model used on your data. There are three ways to use language detection:
Determine how to process the data (optional)
Specify the language detection model
By default, language detection will use the latest available AI model on your text. You can also configure your API requests to use a specificmodel version.
Input languages
When you submit documents to be evaluated, language detection will attempt to determine if the text was written in any ofthe supported languages.
If you have content expressed in a less frequently used language, you can try the Language Detection feature to see if it returns a code. The response for languages that can't be detected isunknown.
unknown
Submitting data
Tip
You can use aDocker containerfor language detection, so you can use the API on-premises.
Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. Using the language detection feature synchronously is stateless. No data is stored in your account, and results are returned immediately in the response.
Whenusing this feature asynchronously, the API results are available for 24 hours from the time the request was ingested, and is indicated in the response. After this time period, the results are purged and are no longer available for retrieval.
Getting language detection results
When you get results from language detection, you can stream the results to an application or save the output to a file on the local system.
Language detection will return one predominant language for each document you submit, along with it'sISO 639-1name, a human-readable name, a confidence score, script name and script code according to theISO 15924 standard. A positive score of 1 indicates the highest possible confidence level of the analysis.
Ambiguous content
In some cases it may be hard to disambiguate languages based on the input. You can use thecountryHintparameter to specify anISO 3166-1 alpha-2country/region code. By default the API uses "US" as the default country hint. To remove this behavior, you can reset this parameter by setting this value to empty stringcountryHint = "".
countryHint
countryHint = ""
For example, "communication" is common to both English and French and if given with limited context the response will be based on the "US" country/region hint. If the origin of the text is known to be coming from France that can be given as a hint.
Note
Ambiguous content can cause confidence scores to be lower.
ThecountryHintin the response is only applicable if the confidence score is less than 0.8.
countryHint
Input
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "communication"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "text": "communication",
            "countryHint": "fr"
        }
    ]
}
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "communication"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "text": "communication",
            "countryHint": "fr"
        }
    ]
}
With the second document, the language detection model has additional context to make a better judgment because it contains thecountryHintproperty in the input above. This will return the following output.

If the analyzer can't parse the input, it returns(Unknown). An example is if you submit a text string that consists solely of numbers.
(Unknown)

    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "detectedLanguage": {

                "iso6391Name": "(Unknown)",

            },

Mixed-language content
Mixed-language content within the same document returns the language with the largest representation in the content, but with a lower positive rating. The rating reflects the marginal strength of the assessment. In the following example, input is a blend of English, Spanish, and French. The analyzer counts characters in each segment to determine the predominant language.
Input
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. Â¿Se ofrecen clases en espaÃ±ol? Es mi primera lengua y mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en franÃ§ais?"
        }
    ]
}
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. Â¿Se ofrecen clases en espaÃ±ol? Es mi primera lengua y mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en franÃ§ais?"
        }
    ]
}
Output
The resulting output consists of the predominant language, with a score of less than 1.0, which indicates a weaker level of confidence.

Script name and script code
Note
Script detection is currently limited toselect languages.
The script detection is only available for textual input which is greater than 12 characters in length.
Language detection offers the ability to detect more than one script per language according to theISO 15924 standard. Specifically, Language Detection returns two script-related properties:
script: The human-readable name of the identified script
script
scriptCode: The ISO 15924 code for the identified script
scriptCode
The output of the API includes the value of thescriptCodeproperty for documents that are at least 12 characters or greater in length and matches the list of supported languages and scripts. Script detection is designed to benefit users whose language can be transliterated or written in more than one script, such as Kazakh or Hindi language.
scriptCode
Previously, language detection was designed to detect the language of documents in a wide variety of languages, dialects, and regional variants, but was limited by "Romanization". Romanization refers to conversion of text from one writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, and is necessary to detect many Indo-European languages. However, there are other languages which are written in multiple scripts, such as Kazakh, which can be written in Cyrillic, Perso-Arabic, and Latin scripts. There are also other cases in which users may either choose or are required to transliterate their language in more than one script, such as Hindi transliterated in Latin script, due to the limited availability of keyboards which support its Devanagari script.
Consequently, language detection's expanded support for script detection behaves as follows:
