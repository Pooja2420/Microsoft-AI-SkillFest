When using an Azure Machine Learning workspace (including Azure AI hubs) with a private endpoint, there areseveral ways to handle DNS name resolution. By default, Azure automatically handles name resolution for your workspace and private endpoint. If you insteaduse your own custom DNS server, you must manually create DNS entries or use conditional forwarders for the workspace.
Important
This article covers how to find the fully qualified domain names (FQDN) and IP addresses for these entries if you would like to manually register DNS records in your DNS solution. Additionally this article provides architecture recommendations for how to configure your custom DNS solution to automatically resolve FQDNs to the correct IP addresses. This article does NOT provide information on configuring the DNS records for these items. Consult the documentation for your DNS software for information on how to add records.

Automated DNS server integration
Introduction
There are two common architectures to use automated DNS server integration with Azure Machine Learning:
A customDNS server hosted in an Azure Virtual Network.
A customDNS server hosted on-premises, connected to Azure Machine Learning through ExpressRoute.
While your architecture may differ from these examples, you can use them as a reference point. Both example architectures provide troubleshooting steps that can help you identify components that may be misconfigured.
Another option is to modify thehostsfile on the client that is connecting to the Azure Virtual Network (virtual network) that contains your workspace. For more information, see theHost filesection.

Workspace DNS resolution path
Access to a given Azure Machine Learning workspace via Private Link is done by communicating with the following Fully Qualified Domains (called the workspace FQDNs):
Important
If you're using a hub workspace (including Azure AI Foundry hub), then you have other entries for each project workspace created from the hub.

<managed online endpoint name>.<per-workspace globally-unique identifier>.inference.<region>.privatelink.api.ml.azure.us
The FQDNs resolve to the IP addresses of the Azure Machine Learning workspace in that region. However, resolution of the workspace Private Link FQDNs can be overridden by using a custom DNS server hosted in the virtual network. For an example of this architecture, see thecustom DNS server hosted in a virtual networkexample. For hub and project workspaces, the FQDNs of all project workspaces resolve to the IP address of the hub workspace.
Note
Managed online endpoints share the workspace's private endpoint. If you're manually adding DNS records to the private DNS zoneprivatelink.api.azureml.ms, an A record with wildcard*.<per-workspace globally-unique identifier>.inference.<region>.privatelink.api.azureml.msshould be added to route all endpoints under the workspace to the private endpoint.

Tip
If you're using hub and project workspaces, each project workspace has its own set of FQDNs. For more information, see theworkspace DNS resolutionsection.
Find the IP addresses
To find the internal IP addresses for the FQDNs in the virtual network, use one of the following methods:
Note
The fully qualified domain names and IP addresses are different based on your configuration. For example, the GUID value in the domain name is specific to your workspace.
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Azure portal
To get the ID of the private endpoint network interface, use the following command:az network private-endpoint show --name <endpoint> --resource-group <resource-group> --query 'networkInterfaces[*].id' --output table
To get the ID of the private endpoint network interface, use the following command:
az network private-endpoint show --name <endpoint> --resource-group <resource-group> --query 'networkInterfaces[*].id' --output table
az network private-endpoint show --name <endpoint> --resource-group <resource-group> --query 'networkInterfaces[*].id' --output table
To get the IP address and FQDN information for the workspace or hub workspace, use the following command. Replace<resource-id>with the ID from the previous step:az network nic show --ids <resource-id> --query 'ipConfigurations[*].{IPAddress: privateIPAddress, FQDNs: privateLinkConnectionProperties.fqdns}'The output is similar to the following text:[
    {
        "FQDNs": [
        "fb7e20a0-8891-458b-b969-55ddb3382f51.workspace.eastus.api.azureml.ms",

Create A records in custom DNS server
Once the list of FQDNs and corresponding IP addresses are gathered, proceed to create A records in the configured DNS Server. Refer to the documentation for your DNS server to determine how to create A records. We recommend creating a unique zone for the entire FQDN, and creating the A record in the root of the zone.
Example: Custom DNS Server hosted in virtual network
This architecture uses the common Hub and Spoke virtual network topology. One virtual network contains the DNS server and one contains the private endpoint to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and associated resources. There must be a valid route between both virtual networks. For example, through a series of peered virtual networks.

The following steps describe how this topology works:
Create Private DNS Zone and link to DNS Server Virtual Network:The first step in ensuring a Custom DNS solution works with your Azure Machine Learning workspace is to create two Private DNS Zones rooted at the following domains:Azure Public regions:privatelink.api.azureml.msprivatelink.notebooks.azure.netMicrosoft Azure operated by 21Vianet regions:privatelink.api.ml.azure.cnprivatelink.notebooks.chinacloudapi.cnAzure US Government regions:privatelink.api.ml.azure.usprivatelink.notebooks.usgovcloudapi.netNoteManaged online endpoints share the workspace private endpoint.

The Virtual Network that contains the DNS Server.A Private DNS Zone overrides name resolution for all names within the scope of the root of the zone. This override applies to all Virtual Networks the Private DNS Zone is linked to. For example, if a Private DNS Zone rooted atprivatelink.api.azureml.msis linked to Virtual Network foo, all resources in Virtual Network foo that attempt to resolvebar.workspace.westus2.privatelink.api.azureml.msreceives any record that is listed in theprivatelink.api.azureml.mszone.However, records listed in Private DNS Zones are only returned to devices resolving domains using the default Azure DNS Virtual Server IP address. So the custom DNS Server resolves domains for devices spread throughout your network topology. But the custom DNS Server needs to resolve Azure Machine Learning-related domains against the Azure DNS Virtual Server IP address.

Example: Custom DNS Server hosted on-premises
This architecture uses the common Hub and Spoke virtual network topology. ExpressRoute is used to connect from your on-premises network to the Hub virtual network. The Custom DNS server is hosted on-premises. A separate virtual network contains the private endpoint to the Azure Machine Learning workspace and associated resources. With this topology, there needs to be another virtual network hosting a DNS server that can send requests to the Azure DNS Virtual Server IP address.

The following steps describe how this topology works:

Example: Hosts file
Thehostsfile is a text document that Linux, macOS, and Windows all use to override name resolution for the local computer. The file contains a list of IP addresses and the corresponding host name. When the local computer tries to resolve a host name, if the host name is listed in thehostsfile, the name is resolved to the corresponding IP address.
hosts
hosts
Important
Thehostsfile only overrides name resolution for the local computer. If you want to use ahostsfile with multiple computers, you must modify it individually on each computer.
hosts
hosts
The following table lists the location of thehostsfile:
hosts
/etc/hosts
/etc/hosts
%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Tip
The name of the file ishostswith no extension. When editing the file, use administrator access. For example, on Linux or macOS you might usesudo vi. On Windows, run notepad as an administrator.

Dependency services DNS resolution
The services that your workspace relies on may also be secured using a private endpoint. If so, then you might need to create a custom DNS record if you need to directly communicate with the service. For example, if you want to directly work with the data in an Azure Storage Account used by your workspace.
Note
Some services have multiple private-endpoints for subservices or features. For example, an Azure Storage Account may have individual private endpoints for Blob, File, and DFS. If you need to access both Blob and File storage, then you must enable resolution for each specific private endpoint.
For more information on the services and DNS resolution, seeAzure Private Endpoint DNS configuration.
Troubleshooting
If after running through the above steps you're unable to access the workspace from a virtual machine or jobs fail on compute resources in the Virtual Network containing the Private Endpoint to the Azure Machine Learning workspace, follow the below steps to try to identify the cause.
Locate the workspace FQDNs on the Private Endpoint:Navigate to the Azure portal using one of the following links:Azure Public regionsMicrosoft Azure operated by 21Vianet regionsAzure US Government regionsNavigate to the Private Endpoint to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. The workspace FQDNs is listed on the "Overview" tab.
Locate the workspace FQDNs on the Private Endpoint:
Navigate to the Azure portal using one of the following links:

Proceed to access a compute resource in the Azure Virtual Network topology. This likely requires accessing a Virtual Machine in a Virtual Network that is peered with the Hub Virtual Network.
Resolve workspace FQDNs:Open a command prompt, shell, or PowerShell. Then for each of the workspace FQDNs, run the following command:nslookup <workspace FQDN>The result of each nslookup should yield one of the two private IP addresses on the Private Endpoint to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. If it doesn't, then there's something misconfigured in the custom DNS solution.Possible causes:The compute resource running the troubleshooting commands isn't using DNS Server for DNS resolutionThe Private DNS Zones chosen when creating the Private Endpoint aren't linked to the DNS Server virtual networkConditional forwarders from DNS Server to Azure DNS Virtual Server IP weren't configured correctlyConditional forwarders from On-premises DNS Server to DNS Server weren't configured correctly
Resolve workspace FQDNs:
Open a command prompt, shell, or PowerShell. Then for each of the workspace FQDNs, run the following command:
nslookup <workspace FQDN>

The result of each nslookup should yield one of the two private IP addresses on the Private Endpoint to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. If it doesn't, then there's something misconfigured in the custom DNS solution.
Possible causes:
The compute resource running the troubleshooting commands isn't using DNS Server for DNS resolution
The Private DNS Zones chosen when creating the Private Endpoint aren't linked to the DNS Server virtual network
Conditional forwarders from DNS Server to Azure DNS Virtual Server IP weren't configured correctly
