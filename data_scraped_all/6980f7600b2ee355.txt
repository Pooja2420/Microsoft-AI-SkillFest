Note
Read access only lets admins view data. Admins need different permissions to manage resources in the Azure Virtual Desktop portal.
Log Analytics settings
To start using Azure Virtual Desktop Insights, you need at least one Log Analytics workspace. Use a designated Log Analytics workspace for your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts to ensure that performance counters and events are only collected from session hosts in your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment. If you already have a workspace set up, skip ahead toSet up the configuration workbook. To set one up, seeCreate a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal.
Note
Standard data storage charges for Log Analytics apply. To start, we recommend you choose the pay-as-you-go model and adjust as you scale your deployment and take in more data. To learn more, seeAzure Monitor pricing.
Set up the configuration workbook
If it's your first time opening Azure Virtual Desktop Insights, you need to set up Azure Virtual Desktop Insights for your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. To configure your resources:
Open Azure Virtual Desktop Insights in the Azure portal ataka.ms/avdi.
aka.ms/avdi
SelectWorkbooks, then selectCheck Configuration.
Select an Azure Virtual Desktop environment to configure from the drop-down lists forSubscription,Resource Group, andHost Pool.
The configuration workbook sets up your monitoring environment and lets you check the configuration after you finish the setup process. It's important to check your configuration if items in the dashboard aren't displaying correctly, or when the product group publishes updates that require new settings.
Resource diagnostic settings
To collect information on your Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure, you need to enable several diagnostic settings on your Azure Virtual Desktop host pools and workspaces (your Azure Virtual Desktop workspace, not your Log Analytics workspace). To learn more about host pools, workspaces, and other Azure Virtual Desktop resource objects, see ourenvironment guide.
You can learn more about Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics and the supported diagnostic tables atSend Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics to Log Analytics.
To set your resource diagnostic settings in the configuration workbook:
Select theResource diagnostic settingstab in the configuration workbook.
SelectLog Analytics workspaceto send Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics.
To set up host pool diagnostics using the resource diagnostic settings section in the configuration workbook:
UnderHost pool, check to see whether Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics are enabled. If they aren't, an error message appears that saysNo existing diagnostic configuration was found for the selected host pool. You need to enable the following supported diagnostic tables:Management ActivitiesFeedConnectionsErrorsCheckpointsHostRegistrationAgentHealthStatusNoteIf you don't see the error message, you don't need to do steps 2 through 4.
UnderHost pool, check to see whether Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics are enabled. If they aren't, an error message appears that saysNo existing diagnostic configuration was found for the selected host pool. You need to enable the following supported diagnostic tables:

Session host data settings
You use the Azure Monitor Agent to collect information on your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.
To collect information on your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts, you must configure aData Collection Rule (DCR)to collect performance data and Windows Event Logs, associate the session hosts with the DCR, install the Azure Monitor Agent on all session hosts in host pools you're collecting data from, and ensure the session hosts are sending data to a Log Analytics workspace.
The Log Analytics workspace you send session host data to doesn't have to be the same one you send diagnostic data to.
To configure a DCR and select a Log Analytics workspace destination using the configuration workbook:
From the Azure Virtual Desktop overview page, selectHost pools, then select the pooled host pool you want to monitor.
From the Azure Virtual Desktop overview page, selectHost pools, then select the pooled host pool you want to monitor.

You need to install the Azure Monitor Agent on all session hosts in the host pool and send data from those hosts to your selected Log Analytics workspace. If the session hosts don't all meet the requirements, you see aSession hostssection at the top ofSession host data settingswith the messageSome hosts in the host pool are not sending data to the selected Log Analytics workspace.
Note
If you don't see theSession hostssection or error message, all session hosts are set up correctly. Automated deployment is limited to 1,000 session hosts or fewer.
To set up your remaining session hosts using the configuration workbook:
Select the DCR you're using for data collection.
Select the DCR you're using for data collection.
SelectDeploy associationto create the DCR association.

Note
For larger host pools (over 1,000 session hosts) or if you encounter deployment issues, we recommend youinstall the Azure Monitor Agentwhen you create a session host by using an Azure Resource Manager template.
You need to enable specific performance counters to collect performance information from your session hosts and send it to the Log Analytics workspace.
If you already have performance counters enabled and want to remove them, follow the instructions inConfiguring performance counters. You can add and remove performance counters in the same location.
To set up performance counters using the configuration workbook:
UnderWorkspace performance countersin the configuration workbook, checkConfigured countersto see the counters you already enabled and send to the Log Analytics workspace. CheckMissing countersto make sure you enable all required counters.
If you have missing counters, selectConfigure performance counters.
SelectApply Config.
Refresh the configuration workbook.
Make sure all the required counters are enabled by checking theMissing counterslist.
You also need to enable specific Windows Event Logs to collect errors, warnings, and information from the session hosts and send them to the Log Analytics workspace.
If you already enabled Windows Event Logs and want to remove them, follow the instructions inConfiguring Windows Event Logs.  You can add and remove Windows Event Logs in the same location.
To set up Windows Event Logs using the configuration workbook:
UnderWindows Event Logs configuration, checkConfigured Event Logsto see the Event Logs you already enabled and send to the Log Analytics workspace. CheckMissing Event Logsto make sure you enable all Windows Event Logs.
If you have missing Windows Event Logs, selectConfigure Events.
SelectDeploy.
Refresh the configuration workbook.
Make sure all the required Windows Event Logs are enabled by checking theMissing Event Logslist.
Note
If automatic event deployment fails, selectOpen agent configurationin the configuration workbook to manually add any missing Windows Event Logs.
Optional: configure alerts
Azure Virtual Desktop Insights allows you to monitor Azure Monitor alerts happening within your selected subscription in the context of your Azure Virtual Desktop data. Azure Monitor alerts are an optional feature on your Azure subscriptions, and you need to set them up separately from Azure Virtual Desktop Insights. You can use the Azure Monitor alerts framework to set custom alerts on Azure Virtual Desktop events, diagnostics, and resources. To learn more about Azure Monitor alerts, seeAzure Monitor Log Alerts.
Diagnostic and usage data
Microsoft automatically collects usage and performance data through your use of the Azure Virtual Desktop Insights service. Microsoft uses this data to improve the quality, security, and integrity of the service.
To provide accurate and efficient troubleshooting capabilities, the collected data includes the portal session ID, Microsoft Entra user ID, and the name of the portal tab where the event occurred. Microsoft doesn't collect names, addresses, or other contact information.
