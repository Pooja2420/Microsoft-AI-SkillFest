Note
Azure Automation State Configuration will be retired on September 30, 2027, please transition toAzure Machine Configurationby that date. For more information, see theblog postannouncement. The Azure Machine Configuration service combines features of DSC Extension, Azure
Automation State Configuration, and the most commonly requested features from customer feedback.
Azure Machine Configuration also includes hybrid machine support throughArc-enabled servers.
Important
TheAdd,Compose configuration, andGallerynavigation links will be removed from the
portal on March 31, 2025.
Caution
Azure Automation DSC for Linux has retired. For more information, see theannouncement.
By enabling Azure Automation State Configuration, you can manage and monitor the configurations of your Windows servers using Desired State Configuration (DSC). Configurations that drift from a desired configuration can be identified or auto-corrected. This quickstart steps through enabling an Azure VM and deploying a LAMP stack using Azure Automation State Configuration.
Prerequisites
To complete this quickstart, you need:
An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription,create a free account.
An Azure Resource Manager virtual machine.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Enable a virtual machine
There are many different methods to enable a machine for Automation State Configuration. This quickstart tells how to enable the feature for an Azure VM using an Automation account. You can learn more about different methods to enable your machines for State Configuration by readingEnable machines for management by Azure Automation State Configuration.
In the Azure portal, navigate toAutomation accounts.
From the list of Automation accounts, select an account.
From the left pane of the Automation account, selectState configuration (DSC).
ClickAddto open theVM selectpage.
Find the virtual machine for which to enable DSC. You can use the search field and filter options to find a specific virtual machine.
Click on the virtual machine, and then clickConnect.
Select the DSC settings appropriate for the virtual machine. If you have already prepared a configuration, you can specify it asNode Configuration Name. You can set theconfiguration modeto control the configuration behavior for the machine.
Node Configuration Name
ClickOK. While the DSC extension is deployed to the virtual machine, the status reported isConnecting.
Connecting
Import modules
Modules contain DSC resources and many can be found in thePowerShell Gallery. Any resources that are used in your configurations must be imported to the Automation account before compiling. For this quickstart, the module namednxis required.
From the left pane of the Automation account, selectModules GalleryunderShared Resources.
Search for the module to import by typing part of its name:nx.
nx
Click on the module to import.
ClickImport.
Import the configuration
This quickstart uses a DSC configuration that configures Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, and PHP on the machine. SeeDSC configurations.
In a text editor, type the following and save it locally asAMPServer.ps1.
configuration 'LAMPServer' {
   Import-DSCResource -module "nx"

   Node localhost {

        $requiredPackages = @("httpd","mod_ssl","php","php-mysql","mariadb","mariadb-server")
        $enabledServices = @("httpd","mariadb")

        #Ensure packages are installed
        ForEach ($package in $requiredPackages){
            nxPackage $Package{
                Ensure = "Present"
                Name = $Package
                PackageManager = "yum"
            }
        }

        #Ensure daemons are enabled
        ForEach ($service in $enabledServices){
            nxService $service{
                Enabled = $true
                Name = $service
                Controller = "SystemD"
                State = "running"
            }
        }
   }
}
configuration 'LAMPServer' {
   Import-DSCResource -module "nx"

   Node localhost {

        $requiredPackages = @("httpd","mod_ssl","php","php-mysql","mariadb","mariadb-server")
        $enabledServices = @("httpd","mariadb")

        #Ensure packages are installed
        ForEach ($package in $requiredPackages){
            nxPackage $Package{
                Ensure = "Present"
                Name = $Package
                PackageManager = "yum"
            }
        }

        #Ensure daemons are enabled
        ForEach ($service in $enabledServices){
            nxService $service{
                Enabled = $true
                Name = $service
                Controller = "SystemD"
                State = "running"
            }
        }
   }
}
To import the configuration:
In the left pane of the Automation account, selectState configuration (DSC)and then click theConfigurationstab.
Click+ Add.
Select the configuration file that you saved in the prior step.
ClickOK.
Compile a configuration
You must compile a DSC configuration to a node configuration (MOF document) before it can be assigned to a node. Compilation validates the configuration and allows for the input of parameter values. To learn more about compiling a configuration, seeCompiling configurations in State Configuration.
In the left pane of the Automation account, selectState Configuration (DSC)and then click theConfigurationstab.
Select the configurationLAMPServer.
LAMPServer
From the menu options, selectCompileand then clickYes.
In the Configuration view, you see a new compilation job queued. When the job has completed successfully, you are ready to move on to the next step. If there are any failures, you can click on the compilation job for details.
Assign a node configuration
You can assign a compiled node configuration to a DSC node. Assignment applies the configuration to the machine and monitors or auto-corrects for any drift from that configuration.
In the left pane of the Automation account, selectState Configuration (DSC)and then click theNodestab.
Select the node to which to assign a configuration.
ClickAssign Node Configuration
Select the node configurationLAMPServer.localhostand clickOK. State Configuration now assigns the compiled configuration to the node, and the node status changes toPending. On the next periodic check, the node retrieves the configuration, applies it, and reports status.
LAMPServer.localhost
Pending
It can take up to 30 minutes for the node to retrieve the configuration, depending on the node settings.
View node status
You can view the status of all State Configuration-managed nodes in your Automation account. The information is displayed by choosingState Configuration (DSC)and clicking theNodestab. You can filter the display by status, node configuration, or name search.

Next steps
In this quickstart, you enabled an Azure VM for State Configuration, created a configuration for a LAMP stack, and deployed the configuration to the VM. To learn how you can use Azure Automation State Configuration to enable continuous deployment, continue to the article:
