Modern data warehouses for small and midsize-sized businesses
This article describes several ways that small and midsize-sized businesses (SMBs) can modernize legacy data stores and explore big data tools and capabilities without overextending current budgets and skill sets. These comprehensive data warehousing solutions seamlessly integrate with Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI services, Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and other Microsoft technologies. These solutions provide an easy entry point to the fully managed software as a service (SaaS) data platform on Microsoft Fabric that can expand as your needs grow.
SMBs that use on-premises SQL Server for data warehousing solutions under 500 GB might benefit from using this pattern. They use various tools for data ingestion into their data warehousing solution, including SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), common SQL stored procedures, external extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) tools, SQL Server Agent jobs, and SQL snapshot replication. Data synchronization operations are typically snapshot-based, performed once a day, and don't have real-time reporting requirements.

A conceptual modernization opportunity involves transitioning the legacy data warehousing solution to a combination of Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Fabric. This strategy ensures broad compatibility with traditional SQL Server and SQL client tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). It also provides lift-and-shift options for existing processes and requires minimal upskilling for the support team. This solution serves as an initial step toward comprehensive modernization, which enables the organization to fully adopt a lakehouse approach as the data warehouse expands and the team's skill set grows.

Dataflow
The following dataflow corresponds to the preceding diagram. It demonstrates the ingestion of the data type that you choose:
Fabric data pipelines or Azure Data Factory pipelines orchestrate the ingestion of transactional data into the data warehousing solution.The pipelines orchestrate the flow of migrated or partially refactored legacy databases and SSIS packages into SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance. You can quickly implement this lift-and-shift approach, which ensures a seamless transition from an on-premises SQL solution to a future Fabric SaaS environment. You can modernize databases incrementally after the lift and shift.The pipelines can pass unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data into Azure Data Lake Storage for centralized storage and analysis with other sources. Use this approach when fusing data provides more business benefit than replatforming the data.

Scenario details
When SMBs modernize their on-premises data warehouses for the cloud, they can either adopt big data tools for future scalability or use traditional SQL-based solutions for cost efficiency, ease of maintenance, and a smooth transition. A hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds and enables easy migration of existing data estates while using modern tools and AI capabilities. SMBs can keep their SQL-based data sources running in the cloud and modernize them as needed.
This article describes several strategies for SMBs to modernize legacy data stores and explore big data tools and capabilities without stretching current budgets and skill sets. These comprehensive Azure data warehousing solutions seamlessly integrate with Azure and Microsoft services, including AI services, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft Power Platform.
