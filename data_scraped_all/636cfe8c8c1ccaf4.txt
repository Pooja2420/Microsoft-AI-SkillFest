This article shows you how to deploy, update, and uninstall Azure virtual machine (VM) extensions supported by Azure Arc-enabled servers. It shows you how to perform these tasks on a Linux or Windows hybrid machine by using the Azure portal.
Note
The Azure Key Vault VM extension does not support deployment from the Azure portal. Use the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy this extension.
Azure Arc-enabled servers doesn't support deploying and managing VM extensions to Azure virtual machines. For Azure VMs, see theVM extension overviewarticle.

You can apply VM extensions to your machine managed through Azure Arc-enabled servers by using the Azure portal:
In your browser, go to theAzure portal.

Note
Although multiple extensions can be batched and processed together, they're installed serially. After installation of the first extension is complete, the next extension is installed.

Upgrade extensions
When a new version of a supported extension is released, you can upgrade the extension to that latest release. When you go to Azure Arc-enabled servers in the Azure portal, a banner informs you that upgrades are available for one or more extensions installed on a machine.
When you view the list of installed extensions for a selected Azure Arc-enabled server, notice the column labeledUpdate available. If a newer version of an extension is released, theUpdate availablevalue for that extension shows a value ofYes.
Note
Although the Azure portal currently uses the wordUpdatefor this experience, that word does not accurately represent the behavior of the operation. Extensions are upgraded by installing a newer version of the extension that's currently installed on the machine or server.
Upgrading an extension to the newest version does not affect the configuration of that extension. You're not required to respecify configuration information for any extension that you upgrade.

You can upgrade one or multiple extensions that are eligible for an upgrade by performing the following steps in the Azure portal.
Note
Currently, you can upgrade extensions only from the Azure portal. Performing this operation from the Azure CLI or an Azure Resource Manager template is not supported at this time.
