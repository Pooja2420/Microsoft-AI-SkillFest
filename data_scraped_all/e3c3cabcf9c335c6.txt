Azure AI Search can send operation logs and service metrics to an Azure Storage account, which can then be visualized in Power BI. This article explains the steps and how to use a Power BI template app to visualize the data. The template covers information about queries, indexing, operations, and service metrics.
Note
The Power BI template is currently using the previous product name, Azure Cognitive Search. The name change will be updated on the next template refresh.
Set up logging and install the template
Enable metric and resource logging for your search service:Create or identify an existingAzure Storage accountwhere you can archive the logs.Navigate to your search service in the Azure portal.Under Monitoring, selectDiagnostic settings.SelectAdd diagnostic setting.CheckArchive to a storage account, provide your storage account information, and checkOperationLogsandAllMetrics.SelectSave.

SelectAdd diagnostic setting.
CheckArchive to a storage account, provide your storage account information, and checkOperationLogsandAllMetrics.
SelectSave.
Once logging is enabled, logs and metrics are generated as you use the search service. It can take up to an hour before logged events show up in Azure Storage. Look for ainsights-logs-operationlogscontainer for operations and ainsights-metrics-pt1mcontainer for metrics. Check your storage account for these containers to make sure you have data to visualize.
