This article describes how to configureHAProxyas your load balancer for a workload cluster in AKS Arc. For custom load balancer integration, seeCreate and use a custom load balancer.
In AKS Arc, the load balancer is deployed as a virtual machine (VM) running Linux andHAProxy + KeepAliveto provide load balanced services for the workload clusters. AKS load balances requests to the Kubernetes API server, and manages traffic to application services.
Before you begin
InstallAKS Arc, and provide a range of virtual IP addresses for the load balancer during the network configuration step.
Make sure you have enough memory and storage to create a new virtual machine and have virtual IP addresses to assign to application services.
Configure load balancer
To configure a load balancer, useNew-AksHciClusterto provision a new cluster as shown in the following example:
New-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -loadBalancerVmSize Standard_A4_v2
New-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -loadBalancerVmSize Standard_A4_v2
This example creates a new workload cluster with a load balancer deployed as a virtual machine running HAProxy to manage traffic for your applications.
