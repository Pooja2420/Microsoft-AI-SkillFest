Hibernating a virtual machine allows you to persist the VM state to the OS disk. This article describes how to troubleshoot issues with the hibernation feature, issues creating hibernation enabled VMs, and issues with hibernating a VM.
For information specific to Linux VMs, check out theLinux VM hibernation troubleshooting guide.
For information specific to Windows VMs, check out theWindows VM hibernation troubleshooting guide.
Unable to create a VM with hibernation enabled
If you're unable to create a VM with hibernation enabled, ensure that you're using a VM size, OS version that supports Hibernation. Refer to the supported VM sizes, OS versions section in the user guide and the limitations section for more details. Here are some common error codes that you might observe:
Unable to hibernate a VM
If you're unable to hibernate a VM, first check whether hibernation is enabled on the VM. For example, using the GET VM API, you can check if hibernation is enabled on the VM
"properties": {
        "vmId": "XXX",
        "hardwareProfile": {
            "vmSize": "Standard_D4s_v5"
        },
        "additionalCapabilities": {
            "hibernationEnabled": true
        },
"properties": {
        "vmId": "XXX",
        "hardwareProfile": {
            "vmSize": "Standard_D4s_v5"
        },
        "additionalCapabilities": {
            "hibernationEnabled": true
        },
If hibernation is enabled on the VM, check if hibernation is successfully enabled in the guest OS.
