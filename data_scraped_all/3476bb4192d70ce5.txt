Data collection rule associations (DCRAs) associate DCRs with monitored resources in Azure Monitor as described inUsing a DCR. This article describes different methods for viewing and creating DCRAs and their related resources.
Important
Not all data collection scenarios with DCRs use DCRAs. SeeUsing a DCRfor an explanation and comparison of how DCRs are specified in different data collection scenarios.
View and modify associations for a DCR in the Azure portal
To view your DCRs in the Azure portal, selectData Collection RulesunderSettingson theMonitormenu. Select a DCR to view its details.

Click theResourcestab to view the resources associated with the selected DCR. ClickAddto add an association to a new resource. You can view and add resources using this feature whether or not you created the DCR in the Azure portal.

Note
Although this view shows all DCRs in the specified subscriptions, selecting theCreatebutton creates a data collection for Azure Monitor Agent. Similarly, this page only allows you to modify DCRs for Azure Monitor Agent. For guidance on how to create and update DCRs for other workflows, seeCreate and edit data collection rules (DCRs) in Azure Monitor.
Preview DCR experience
A preview of the new Azure portal experience for DCRs ties together DCRs and the resources they're associated with. You can either view the list byData collection rule, which shows the number of resources associated with each DCR, or byResources, which shows the count of DCRs associated with each resource.
Select the option on the displayed banner to enable this experience.

Data collection rule view
In theData collection ruleview, theResource countrepresents the number of resources that have adata collection rule associationwith the DCR. Click this value to open theResourcesview for that DCR.

Resources view
TheResourcesview lists all Azure resources that match the selected filter, whether they have a DCR association or not. Tiles at the top of the view list the count of total resources listed, the number of resources not associated with a DCR, and the total number of DCRs matching the selected filter.

View DCRs for a resource
TheData collection rulescolumn represents the number of DCRs that are associated with each resource. Click this value to open a new pane listing the DCRs associated with the resource.

Important
Not all DCRs are associated with resources. For example, DCRs used with theLogs ingestion APIare specified in the API call and don't use associations. These DCRs still appear in the view, but have aResource Countof 0.
Create new DCR or associations with existing DCR
Using theResourcesview, you can create a new DCR for the selected resources or associate them with an existing DCR. Select the resources and then click one of the following options.

Create new association
In addition to the preview Azure portal experience, you can create a new association using any of the following methods. The DCRA object that's created is a child of the target object and uses the resource ID of the DCR.
Note
DCRs can't be associated with a virtual machine scale set (VMSS) with flexible orchestration. Instead, create an association with each included VM.
CLI
PowerShell
ARM template
Create association with CLI
Use theaz monitor data-collection rule association createcommand to create an association between your DCR and resource.
az monitor data-collection rule association create --name "my-vm-dcr-association" --rule-id "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules/my-dcr" --resource "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm"
az monitor data-collection rule association create --name "my-vm-dcr-association" --rule-id "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules/my-dcr" --resource "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm"
Create association with PowerShell
Use theNew-AzDataCollectionRuleAssociationcommand to create an association between your DCR and resource.
New-AzDataCollectionRuleAssociation -TargetResourceId '/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm' -DataCollectionRuleId '/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/my-resource-group/providers/microsoft.insights/datacollectionrules/my-dcr' -AssociationName 'my-vm-dcr-association'
New-AzDataCollectionRuleAssociation -TargetResourceId '/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm' -DataCollectionRuleId '/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/my-resource-group/providers/microsoft.insights/datacollectionrules/my-dcr' -AssociationName 'my-vm-dcr-association'
Create association with ARM templates
The ARM templates for associations differ for different target objects. Following are templates you can use for different types of objects.
The following sample creates an association between an Azure virtual machine and a data collection rule.

Azure Policy
UsingAzure Policy, you can associate a DCR with multiple resources at scale. When you create an assignment between a resource group and a built-in policy or initiative, associations are created between the DCR and each resource of the assigned type in the resource group, including any new resources as they're created. Azure Monitor provides a simplified user experience to create an assignment for a policy or initiative for a particular DCR, which is an alternate method to creating the assignment using Azure Policy directly.
Note
Apolicyin Azure Policy is a single rule or condition that resources in Azure must comply with. For example, there's a built-in policy calledConfigure Windows Machines to be associated with a Data Collection Rule or a Data Collection Endpoint.
Aninitiativeis a collection of policies that are grouped together to achieve a specific goal or purpose. For example, there's an initiative calledConfigure Windows machines to run Azure Monitor Agent and associate them to a Data Collection Rulethat includes multiple policies to install and configure the Azure Monitor agent.
From the DCR in the Azure portal, selectPolicies (Preview). This opens a page that lists any assignments with the current DCR and the compliance state of included resources. Tiles across the top provide compliance metrics for all resources and assignments.

To create a new assignment, click eitherAssign PolicyorAssign Initiative.

Once an assignment is created, you can view its details by clicking on it. This allows you to edit the details of the assignment and also to create a remediation task.

Important
The assignment won't be applied to existing resources until you create a remediation task. For more information, seeRemediate noncompliant resources with Azure Policy.
