This article describes details about the permissions available for the different workspace objects.
Note
Access control requires thePremium plan.
Access control settings are disabled by default on workspaces that are upgraded from the Standard plan to the Premium plan. Once an access control setting is enabled, it can not be disabled. For more information, seeAccess controls lists can be enabled on upgraded workspaces.
Access control lists overview
In Azure Databricks, you can use access control lists (ACLs) to configure permission to access workspace level objects. Workspace admins have the CAN MANAGE permission on all objects in their workspace, which gives them the ability to manage permissions on all objects in their workspaces. Users automatically have the CAN MANAGE permission for objects that they create.
For an example of how to map typical personas to workspace-level permissions, see theProposal for Getting Started With Databricks Groups and Permissions.
Manage access control lists with folders
You can manage workspace object permissions by adding objects to folders. Objects in a folder inherit all permissions settings of that folder. For example, a user that has the CAN RUN permission on a folder has CAN RUN permission on the alerts in that folder.
If you grant a user access to an object inside the folder, they can view the parent folderâs name, even if they do not have permissions on the parent folder. For example, a notebook namedtest1.pyis in a folder namedWorkflows. If you grant a user CAN VIEW ontest1.pyand no permissions onWorkflows, the user can see that the parent folder is namedWorkflows. The user cannot view or access any other objects in theWorkflowsfolder unless they have been granted permissions on them.

Users with CAN ATTACH TO permissions can view the service account
keys in the log4j file. Use caution when granting this permission level.

Note
Secretsare not redacted from a clusterâs Spark driver logstdoutandstderrstreams. To protect sensitive data, by default, Spark driver logs are viewable only by users with CAN MANAGE permission on job, dedicated access mode, and standard access mode clusters. To allow users with CAN ATTACH TO or CAN RESTART permission to view the logs on these clusters, set the following Spark configuration property in the cluster configuration:spark.databricks.acl.needAdminPermissionToViewLogs false.
stdout
stderr
spark.databricks.acl.needAdminPermissionToViewLogs false
On No Isolation Shared access mode clusters, the Spark driver logs can be viewed by users with CAN ATTACH TO or CAN MANAGE permission. To limit who can read the logs to only users with the CAN MANAGE permission, setspark.databricks.acl.needAdminPermissionToViewLogstotrue.
spark.databricks.acl.needAdminPermissionToViewLogs
true

Legacy dashboard ACLs
Editing a legacy dashboard requires theRun as viewersharing setting. SeeRefresh behavior and execution context.
DLT pipeline ACLs
Feature tables ACLs
This table describes how to control access to feature tables in workspaces that are not enabled for Unity Catalog. If your workspace is enabled for Unity Catalog, useUnity Catalog privilegesinstead.
Note
Feature Store access control does not govern access to the underlyingDelta table, which is governed bytable access control.
For more information about workspace feature table permissions, seeControl access to feature tables in Workspace Feature Store (legacy).
File ACLs
Note
The workspace UI refers to view-only access as CAN VIEW, while the Permissions API uses CAN READ to represent the same level of access.
Folder ACLs
Note
The workspace UI refers to view-only access as CAN VIEW, while the Permissions API uses CAN READ to represent the same level of access.
Genie space ACLs
Git folder ACLs
Job ACLs
MLflow experiment ACLs
MLflow experiment ACLs are different for notebook experiments and workspace experiments. Notebook experiments cannot be managed independently of the notebook that created them, so the permissions are similar to notebook permissions. To learn more about the two types of experiments, seeOrganize training runs with MLflow experiments.
ACLs for notebook experiments
Changing these permissions also modifies the permissions on the notebook that corresponds to the experiment.
