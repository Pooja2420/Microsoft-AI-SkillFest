Schema: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys.Rows: Only matching rows from both tables.
Example
The example query combines rows from tables X and Y where the keys match, showing only the rows that exist in both tables.
Run the query
let X = datatable(Key:string, Value1:long)
[
    'a',1,
    'b',2,
    'b',3,
    'k',5,
    'c',4
];
let Y = datatable(Key:string, Value2:long)
[
    'b',10,
    'c',20,
    'c',30,
    'd',40,
    'k',50
];
X | join kind=inner Y on Key
let X = datatable(Key:string, Value1:long)
[
    'a',1,
    'b',2,
    'b',3,
    'k',5,
    'c',4
];
let Y = datatable(Key:string, Value2:long)
[
    'b',10,
    'c',20,
    'c',30,
    'd',40,
    'k',50
];
X | join kind=inner Y on Key
Output
Note
(b,10) from the right side, was joined twice: with both (b,2) and (b,3) on the left.
(c,4) on the left side, was joined twice: with both (c,20) and (c,30) on the right.
(k,5) from the left and (k, 50) from the right was joined once.
