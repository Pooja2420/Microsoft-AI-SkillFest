This article describes reliability support in Microsoft Fabric, and both regional resiliency with availability zones andcross-region recovery and business continuity. For a more detailed overview of reliability in Azure, seeAzure reliability.
Availability zone support
Availability zones are physically separate groups of datacenters within each Azure region. When one zone fails, services can fail over to one of the remaining zones.
For more information on availability zones in Azure, seeWhat are availability zones?
Fabric makes commercially reasonable efforts to support zone-redundant availability zones, where resources automatically replicate across zones, without any need for you to set up or configure.
Prerequisites
Fabric currently provides partial availability-zone support in alimited number of regions. This partial availability-zone support covers experiences (and/or certain functionalities within an experience).
Experiences such as Event Streams don't support availability zones.
Data engineering supports availability zones if you use OneLake. If you use other data sources such as ADLS Gen2, then you need to ensure that Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) is enabled.
Zone availability may or may not be available for Fabric experiences and/or features/functionalities that are in preview.
On-premises gateways and large semantic models in Power BI don't support availability zones.
Data Factory (pipelines) support availability zones in West Europe, but new or inprogress pipelines runsmayfail in case of zone outage.
Supported regions
Fabric makes commercially reasonable efforts to provide availability zone support in various regions as follows:
Zone down experience
During a zone-wide outage, no action is required during zone recovery. Fabric capabilities in regions listed insupported regionsself-heal and rebalance automatically to take advantage of the healthy zone. Running Spark Jobs may fail if the master node is in the failed zone. In such a case, the jobs will need to be resubmitted.
Important
While Microsoft strives to provide uniform and consistent availability zone support, in some cases of availability-zone failure, Fabric capacities located in Azure regions with higher customer demand fluctuations might experience higher than normal latency.
Cross-region disaster recovery and business continuity
Disaster recovery (DR) refers to practices that organizations use to recover from high-impact events, such as natural disasters or failed deployments that result in downtime and data loss. Regardless of the cause, the best remedy for a disaster is a well-defined and tested DR plan and an application design that actively supports DR. Before you start creating your disaster recovery plan, seeRecommendations for designing a disaster recovery strategy.
For DR, Microsoft uses theshared responsibility model. In this model, Microsoft ensures that the baseline infrastructure and platform services are available. However, many Azure services don't automatically replicate data or fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. For those services, you're responsible for setting up a disaster recovery plan that works for your workload. Most services that run on Azure platform as a service (PaaS) offerings provide features and guidance to support DR. You can useservice-specific features to support fast recoveryto help develop your DR plan.
This section describes a disaster recovery plan for Fabric that's designed to help your organization keep its data safe and accessible when an unplanned regional disaster occurs. The plan covers the following topics:
Cross-region replication: Fabric offers cross-region replication for data stored in OneLake. You can opt in or out of this feature based on your requirements.

Cross-region replication: Power BI usesAzure storage geo-redundant replicationandAzure SQL geo-redundant replicationto guarantee that backup instances exist in other regions and can be used. This means that data is duplicated across different regions, enhancing its availability, and reducing the risks associated with regional outages.

Important
For customers whose home regions don't have an Azure pair region and are affected by a disaster, the ability to utilize Fabric capacities may be compromisedâeven if the data within those capacities is replicated. This limitation is tied to the home regionâs infrastructure, essential for the capacities' operation.
Home region and capacity functionality
For effective disaster recovery planning, it's critical that you understand the relationship between your home region and capacity locations. Understanding home region and capacity locations helps you make strategic selections of capacity regions, as well as the corresponding replication and recovery processes.
Thehome regionfor your organization's tenancy and data storage is set to the billing address location of the first user that signs up. For further details on tenancy setup, go toPower BI implementation planning: Tenant setup.  When you create new capacities, your data storage is set to the home region by default. If you wish to change your data storage region to another region, you'll need toenable Multi-Geo, a Fabric Premium feature.
Important
Choosing a different region for your capacity doesn't entirely relocate all of your data to that region. Some data elements still remain stored in the home region.  To see which data remains in the home region and which data is stored in the Multi-Geo enabled region, seeConfigure Multi-Geo support for Fabric Premium.
In the case of a home region that doesn't have a paired region, capacities in any Multi-Geo enabled region may face operational issues if the home region encounters a disaster, as the core service functionality is tethered to the home region.
If you select a Multi-Geo enabled region within the EU, it's guaranteed that your data is stored within the EU data boundary.
To learn how to identify your home region, seeFind your Fabric home region.
Disaster recovery capacity setting
Fabric provides a disaster recovery switch on the capacity settings page. It's available where Azureregional pairingsalign with Fabric's service presence. Here are the specifics of this switch:
Role access: Only users with thecapacity adminrole or higher can use this switch.

Note
After turning on the disaster recovery capacity setting, it can take up to one week for the data to start replicating.
Data replication
When you turn on the disaster recovery capacity setting, cross-region replication is enabled as a disaster recovery capability for OneLake data. The Fabric platform aligns with Azure regions to provision the geo-redundancy pairs. However, some regions don't have an Azure pair region, or the pair region doesn't support Fabric. For these regions, data replication isn't available. For more information, seeRegions with availability zones and no region pairandFabric region availability.
Note
While Fabric offers a data replication solution in OneLake to support disaster recovery, there are notable limitations. For instance, the data of KQL databases and query sets is stored externally to OneLake, which means that a separate disaster recovery approach is needed. Refer to the rest of this document for details of the disaster recovery approach for each Fabric item.
Billing
The disaster recovery feature in Fabric enables geo-replication of your data for enhanced security and reliability. This feature consumes more storage and transactions, which are billed as BCDR Storage and BCDR Operations respectively. You can monitor and manage these costs in theMicrosoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app, where they appear as separate line items.
For an exhaustive breakdown of all associated disaster recovery costs to help you plan and budget accordingly, seeOneLake compute and storage consumption.
Set up disaster recovery
While Fabric provides disaster recovery features to support data resiliency, youmustfollow certain manual steps to restore service during disruptions. This section details the actions you should take to prepare for potential disruptions.

Phase 2: Disaster failover
When a major disaster renders the primary region unrecoverable, Microsoft Fabric initiates a regional failover. Access to the Fabric portal is unavailable until the failover is complete and a notification is posted on theâ¯Microsoft Fabric support page.
The time it takes for failover to complete can vary, although it typically takes less than one hour. Once failover is complete, here's what you can expect:
Fabric portal: You can access the portal, and read operations such as browsing existing workspaces and items continue to work. All write operations, such as creating or modifying a workspace, are paused.

In a disaster scenario, the Fabric portal and Power BI are in read-only mode, and other Fabric items are unavailable, you can access their data stored in OneLake using APIs or third-party tools. Both portal and Power BI retain the ability to perform read-write operations on that data. This ability ensures that critical data remains accessible and modifiable, and mitigates potential disruption of your business operations.
OneLake data remains accessible through multiple channels:

While Fabric ensures that data remains accessible after a disaster, you can also act to fully restore their services to the state before the incident. This section provides a step-by-step guide to help you through the recovery process.
Recovery steps
Create a new Fabric capacity in any region after a disaster. Given the high demand during such events, we recommend selecting a region outside your primary geo to increase likelihood of compute service availability. For information about creating a capacity, seeBuy a Microsoft Fabric subscription.
