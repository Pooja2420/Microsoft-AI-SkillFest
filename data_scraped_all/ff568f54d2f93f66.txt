This article shows you how to migrate machines as physical servers to Azure by using the Migration and modernization tool. Migrating machines by treating them as physical servers is useful in many scenarios:
Migrate on-premises physical servers.
Migrate virtual machines (VMs) virtualized by platforms such as Xen and KVM.
Migrate Hyper-V or VMware VMs, if you're unable to use the standard migration process forHyper-VorVMwaremigration.
Migrate VMs running in private clouds.
Migrate VMs running in public clouds, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
This tutorial is the third in a series that demonstrates how to assess and migrate physical servers to Azure. In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Prepare to use Azure with the Migration and modernization tool.
Check requirements for machines you want to migrate. Prepare a machine for the Azure Migrate and Modernize replication appliance that's used to discover and migrate machines to Azure.
Add the Migration and modernization tool in the Azure Migrate and Modernize hub.
Set up the replication appliance.
Install the Mobility service on machines you want to migrate.
Enable replication.
Run a test migration to make sure everything's working as expected.
Run a full migration to Azure.
Note
Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario so that you can quickly set up a proof of concept. Tutorials use default options where possible and don't show all possible settings and paths. For detailed instructions, review the how-to articles for Azure Migrate and Modernize.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, you should:
Reviewthe migration architecture.
Reviewthe limitations related to migrating Windows Server 2008 servers to Azure.
Note
If you're planning to upgrade your Windows operating system, Azure Migrate and Modernize might download the Windows SetupDiag utility for error details in case upgrade fails. Ensure that the VM created in Azure after the migration has access toSetupDiag. If there's no access to SetupDiag, you might not be able to get detailed OS upgrade failure error codes but the upgrade can still proceed.
Prepare Azure
Prepare Azure for migration with the Migration and modernization tool.
Assign permissions to create a project
In the Azure portal, open the subscription and selectAccess control (IAM).
InCheck access, find the relevant account and select it to view permissions.
You should haveContributororOwnerpermissions.If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
Assign Azure account permissions
Assign the VM Contributor role to the Azure account. This role provides permissions to:
Create a VM in the selected resource group.
Create a VM in the selected virtual network.
Write to an Azure managed disk.
Create an Azure network
Important
Virtual networks are a regional service, so make sure you create your virtual network in the desired target Azure region. For example, if you're planning on replicating and migrating VMs from your on-premises environment to the East US Azure Region, your target virtual networkmust be createdin the East US Region. To connect virtual networks in different regions, seeVirtual network peering.
Set upan Azure virtual network. When you replicate to Azure, Azure VMs are created and joined to the Azure virtual network that you specified when you set up migration.
Prepare for migration
To prepare for physical server migration, you need to verify the physical server settings and prepare to deploy a replication appliance.
Check machine requirements for migration
Make sure machines comply with requirements for migration to Azure.
Note
When you migrate physical machines, the Migration and modernization tool uses the same replication architecture as agent-based disaster recovery in Azure Site Recovery. Some components share the same code base. Some content might link to Site Recovery documentation.
Verifyphysical server requirements.
Verifyphysical server requirements.
Verify that on-premises machines that you replicate to Azure comply withAzure VM requirements.
Verify that on-premises machines that you replicate to Azure comply withAzure VM requirements.
Some changes are needed on VMs before you migrate them to Azure:For some operating systems, Azure Migrate and Modernize makes these changes automatically.Make these changes before you begin migration. If you migrate the VM before you make the change, the VM might not boot up in Azure.

ReviewWindowsandLinuxchanges you need to make.
Prepare a machine for the replication appliance
The Migration and modernization tool uses a replication appliance to replicate machines to Azure. The replication appliance runs the following components:
Configuration server: The configuration server coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure and manages data replication.
Process server: The process server acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data and optimizes that data with caching, compression, and encryption. Then it sends the data to a cache storage account in Azure.
To prepare for appliance deployment:
You prepare a machine to host the replication appliance.Reviewthe machine requirements.
The replication appliance uses MySQL. Review theoptionsfor installing MySQL on the appliance.
Review the Azure URLs required for the replication appliance to accesspublicandgovernmentclouds.
Reviewportaccess requirements for the replication appliance.
Note
The replication appliance shouldn't be installed on a source machine that you want to replicate or on the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment appliance you might have installed before.
Set up the replication appliance
The first step of migration is to set up the replication appliance. To set up the appliance for physical server migration, download the installer file for the appliance. Then run it on themachine you prepared. After you install the appliance, register it with the Migration and modernization tool.

After the installation finishes, the Appliance configuration wizard launches automatically. (You can also launch the wizard manually by using thecspsconfigtoolshortcut that was created on the appliance desktop.) In this tutorial, we manually install the Mobility service on the source VMs to be replicated. You need to create a dummy account in this step to proceed. For your dummy account, use "guest" as the friendly name, "username" as the username, and "password" as the password for the account. You use this dummy account in the Enable Replication stage.

The mobility service agent must be installed on the servers to get them discovered by using the replication appliance. Discovered machines appear inAzure Migrate: Server Migration. As VMs are discovered, theDiscovered serverscount rises.
Note
We recommend that you perform discovery and assessment prior to the migration by using the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool, a separate lightweight Azure Migrate appliance. You can deploy the appliance as a physical server to continuously discover servers and performance metadata. For detailed steps, seeDiscover physical servers.
Install the Mobility service agent
A Mobility service agent must be preinstalled on the source physical machines to be migrated before you can start replication. The approach you choose to install the Mobility service agent might depend on your organization's preferences and existing tools. The "push" installation method built into Site Recovery isn't currently supported. Approaches you might want to consider:
System Center Configuration Manager
Azure Arc for servers and custom script extensions
Install Mobility agent for Windows
Install Mobility agent for Linux

Note
You can update replication settings any time before replication starts. SelectManage>Replicating machines. Settings can't be changed after replication starts.
Track and monitor
When you selectReplicate, a Start Replication job begins.
After the Start Replication job finishes successfully, the machines begin their initial replication to Azure.
After initial replication finishes, delta replication begins. Incremental changes to on-premises disks are periodically replicated to the replica disks in Azure.
You can track job status in the portal notifications.
You can monitor replication status by selectingReplicating serversinAzure Migrate: Server Migration.
Run a test migration
When delta replication begins, you can run a test migration for the VMs before you run a full migration to Azure. We highly recommend that you do this step at least once for each machine before you migrate it.
Running a test migration checks that migration works as expected, without affecting the on-premises machines, which remain operational and continue replicating.
Test migration simulates the migration by creating an Azure VM using replicated data. (The test usually migrates to a nonproduction virtual network in your Azure subscription.)
You can use the replicated test Azure VM to validate the migration, perform app testing, and address any issues before full migration.
To do a test migration:
InMigration goals, selectServers, databases and web apps>Migration and modernization, selectâ¯Replicated serversunderReplications.
