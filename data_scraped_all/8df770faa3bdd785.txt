In this quickstart, you learn how to use the Azure portal to enable capturing of events to Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Store.
AzureEvent Hubs Captureenables you to automatically deliver the streaming data in Event Hubs to anAzure Blob storageorAzure Data Lake Storage Gen 2account of your choice. You can configure capture settings using theAzure portalwhen creating an event hub or for an existing event hub. For conceptual information on this feature, seeEvent Hubs Capture overview.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. If you don't have one,create a free accountbefore you begin.
If you're new to Azure Event Hubs, read throughEvent Hubs overviewandEvent Hubs features.
Learn about Event Hubs capture by reading theEvent Hubs Capture overview.
Important
Event Hubs only supportsPremiumStorage account withBlock Blobsupport.
Enable Capture when you create an event hub
If you don't have an Event Hubs namespace to work with, create a namespace by following steps from the article:Create an Event Hubs namespace. Make sure that you selectStandardor higherpricing tier. The basic tier doesn't support the Capture feature.
To create an event hub within the namespace, follow these steps:
On theOverviewpage for your namespace, select+ Event hubon the command bar.
On theOverviewpage for your namespace, select+ Event hubon the command bar.

On theCreate event hubpage, type a name for your event hub, then selectNext: Captureat the bottom of the page.

Important
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 is retired, so don't use it for capturing event data. For more information, see theofficial announcement. If you're using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, migrate to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. For more information, seeAzure Data Lake Storage migration guidelines and patterns.

On the home page for your namespace, selectEvent HubsunderEntitieson the left menu.
On the home page for your namespace, selectEvent HubsunderEntitieson the left menu.

You can use a system-assigned or a user-assigned managed identity when capturing event data. First, you enable a managed identity for a namespace, grant the identity an appropriate role on the target storage for capturing events, and then configure the event hub to capture events using the managed identity. For more information, see the following articles:
Enable managed identity for a namespace.
Use a managed identity to capture events
