Azure Automation State Configuration will be retired on September 30, 2027, please transition toAzure Machine Configurationby that date. For more information, see theblog postannouncement. The Azure Machine Configuration service combines features of DSC Extension, Azure
Automation State Configuration, and the most commonly requested features from customer feedback.
Azure Machine Configuration also includes hybrid machine support throughArc-enabled servers.
Important
TheAdd,Compose configuration, andGallerynavigation links will be removed from the
portal on March 31, 2025.
Caution
Azure Automation DSC for Linux has retired on 30 September 2023. For more information, see theannouncement.
When you need to manage resource with more than a single desired state configuration (DSC), the best
path is to usecomposite resources. A composite resource is a nested and parameterized
configuration being used as a DSC resource within another configuration. Use of composite resources
allows you to create complex configurations while allowing the underlying composite resources to be
individually managed and built.
Azure Automation enables theimport and compilation of composite resources. After importing
composite resources into your Automation account, you can use Azure Automation State Configuration
through theState Configuration (DSC)feature in the Azure portal.
Compose a configuration
Before you can assign a configuration made from composite resources in the Azure portal, you must
compose the configuration. Composition usesCompose configurationon the State Configuration
(DSC) page while on either theConfigurationsor theCompiled configurationstab.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the left, selectAll resourcesand then the name of your Automation account.
On the Automation account page, selectState configuration (DSC)underConfiguration
Management.
On the State configuration (DSC) page, select either theConfigurationsor theCompiled
configurationstab, then selectCompose configurationin the menu at the top of the page.
On theBasicsstep, provide the new configuration name (required) and select anywhere on the
row of each composite resource that you want to include in your new configuration, then selectNextor select theSource codestep. For the following steps, we selectedPSExecutionPolicyandRenameAndDomainJoincomposite resources.
PSExecutionPolicy
RenameAndDomainJoin
TheSource codestep shows what the composed configuration of the selected composite
resources looks like. You can see the merging of all parameters and how they're passed to the
composite resource. When you're done reviewing the new source code, selectNextor select theParametersstep.
On theParametersstep, the parameter for each composite resource is exposed so that values
can be provided. The description of the parameter is displayed next to the parameter field. If a
parameter is a[PSCredential]type, the dropdown provides a list ofCredentialobjects in
the current Automation account. A+ Add a credentialoption is also available. Provide values
for the required parameters then selectSave and compile.
[PSCredential]
Submit the configuration for compilation
Submit the new configuration for compilation. You can view the status of the compilation job like
you do with any imported configuration. For more information, seeView a compilation job.
The successfully completed configuration appears in theCompiled configurationstab. Then you
can assign the configuration to a managed node, using the steps inReassigning a node to a different node configuration.
