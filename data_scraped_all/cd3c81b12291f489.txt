Applies to: Azure Local 2411.1 and later
This article describes how you can use a four-node storage switchless network reference pattern with two TOR L3 switches and two full-mesh links to deploy your Azure Local solution.
Note
Microsoft has tested and validated the four-node switchless network reference patterns described in this article.
Scenarios
Scenarios for this network pattern include laboratories, factories, branch offices, and datacenters.
Consider implementing this pattern when looking for a cost-efficient solution that has fault tolerance across all the network components.
SDN L3 services are fully supported on this pattern. Routing services such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be configured directly on the TOR switches if they support L3 services. Network security features such as micro segmentation or QoS don't require extra configuration of the firewall device, as they're implemented at virtual network adapter layer.

Physical connectivity components
As illustrated in the following four-node network diagram, this pattern has the following physical network components:
For northbound and southbound communication, the Azure Local instance requires two TOR switches in multi-chassis link aggregation group (MLAG) configuration.

Logical networks
Node interconnect networks VLAN for SMB traffic (Storage and live migration)
The Storage intent-based traffic consists of twelve individual subnets supporting RDMA traffic. Each interface is dedicated to a separate node interconnect network. This traffic is only intended to travel between the four nodes. Storage traffic on these subnets is isolated without connectivity to other resources.
Each pair of storage adapters between the nodes operates in different IP subnets. To enable a switchless configuration, each connected node supports the same matching subnet of its neighbor.
When deploying four nodes in a switchless configuration, Network ATC has the following requirements:
Only supports a single VLAN for all the IP subnets used for storage connectivity.

Management VLAN
All physical compute hosts must access the management logical network. For IP address planning purposes, each host must have at least one IP address assigned from the management logical network.
A DHCP server can automatically assign IP addresses for the management network, or you can manually assign static IP addresses. When DHCP is the preferred IP assignment method, DHCP reservations without expiration are recommended.
For information, seeDHCP Network considerations for cloud deployment.
The management network supports two different VLAN configurations for traffic -NativeandTagged:
Native VLAN for management network doesn't require you to supply a VLAN ID.
Native VLAN for management network doesn't require you to supply a VLAN ID.
Tagged VLAN for management network requires VLAN ID configuration on the physical network adapters or the management virtual network adapter before registering the nodes in Azure Arc.

Physical switch ports must be configured correctly to accept the VLAN ID on the management adapters.
Physical switch ports must be configured correctly to accept the VLAN ID on the management adapters.
If the intent includes management and compute traffic types, the physical switch ports must be configured in trunk mode to accept all the VLANs required for management and compute workloads.
If the intent includes management and compute traffic types, the physical switch ports must be configured in trunk mode to accept all the VLANs required for management and compute workloads.
The Management network supports traffic used by the administrator for management of the system including Remote Desktop, Windows Admin Center, and Active Directory.
For more information, seeManagement VLAN network considerations.
Compute VLANs
In some scenarios, you donât need to use SDN Virtual Networks with VXLAN encapsulation. Instead, you can use traditional VLANs to isolate their tenant workloads. Those VLANs need to be configured on the TOR switches port in trunk mode. When connecting new virtual machines to these VLANs, the corresponding VLAN tag is defined on the virtual network adapter.
HNV Provider Address (PA) network
The Hyper-V Network Virtualization Provider Address (HNV PA) network serves as the underlying physical network for East-West (internal-internal) tenant traffic, North-South (external-internal) tenant traffic, and to exchange BGP peering information with the physical network. This network is only required when there's a need for deploying virtual networks using VXLAN encapsulation for an extra layer of isolation and network multitenancy.
For more information, seePlan a Software Defined Network infrastructure.
Network ATC intents
For four-node storage switchless patterns, two Network ATC intents are created. The first intent is for management and compute network traffic, and the second intent is for storage traffic.
Management and compute intent
Intent type: Management and compute
Intent mode: Cluster mode
Teaming: Yes. pNIC01 and pNIC02 team.
Default management VLAN: Configured VLAN for management adapters isnât modified.
PA and compute VLANs and vNICs: Network ATC is transparent to PA vNICs and VLAN or compute VM vNICs and VLANs.
Storage intent
