Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. In this tutorial, you create your own custom image of an Azure virtual machine. You learn how to:
Create an Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery)
Create an image definition
Create an image version
Create a VM from an image
Share a gallery
This tutorial uses the CLI within theAzure Cloud Shell, which is constantly updated to the latest version. To open the Cloud Shell, selectTry itfrom the top of any code block.
If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Runaz --versionto find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure CLI.
az --version
Overview
AnAzure Compute Gallerysimplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations.
The Azure Compute Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want them to be available in, and who you want to share them with.
The Azure Compute Gallery feature has multiple resource types:
Before you begin
The following steps show how to take an existing VM and turn it into a reusable custom image that you can use to create new VM instances.
To complete the example in this tutorial, you must have an existing virtual machine. If needed, you can see theCLI quickstartto create a VM to use for this tutorial. When working through the tutorial, replace the resource names where needed.
Launch Azure Cloud Shell
The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.
To open the Cloud Shell, just selectTry itfrom the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going tohttps://shell.azure.com/powershell. SelectCopyto copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press enter to run it.
Create a gallery
A gallery is the primary resource used for enabling image sharing.
Allowed characters for gallery name are uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, dots, and periods. The gallery name can't contain dashes. Gallery names must be unique within your subscription.
Create a gallery usingaz sig create. The following example creates a resource group named gallery namedmyGalleryRGinEast US, and a gallery namedmyGallery.
az group create --name myGalleryRG --location eastus
az sig create --resource-group myGalleryRG --gallery-name myGallery
az group create --name myGalleryRG --location eastus
az sig create --resource-group myGalleryRG --gallery-name myGallery
Get information about the VM
You can see a list of VMs that are available usingaz vm list.
az vm list --output table
az vm list --output table
Once you know the VM name and what resource group it is in, get the ID of the VM usingaz vm get-instance-view.
az vm get-instance-view -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm --query id
az vm get-instance-view -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm --query id
Copy the ID of your VM to use later.
Create an image definition
Image definitions create a logical grouping for images. They're used to manage information about the image versions that are created within them.
Image definition names can be made up of uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, dots, dashes, and periods.
For more information about the values you can specify for an image definition, seeImage definitions.
Create an image definition in the gallery usingaz sig image-definition create.
In this example, the image definition is namedmyImageDefinition, and is for aspecializedLinux OS image.
az sig image-definition create \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --gallery-image-definition myImageDefinition \
   --publisher myPublisher \
   --offer myOffer \
   --sku mySKU \
   --os-type Linux \
   --os-state specialized
az sig image-definition create \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --gallery-image-definition myImageDefinition \
   --publisher myPublisher \
   --offer myOffer \
   --sku mySKU \
   --os-type Linux \
   --os-state specialized
Copy the ID of the image definition from the output to use later.
Create the image version
Create an image version from the VM usingaz sig image-version create.
Allowed characters for image version are numbers and periods. Numbers must be within the range of a 32-bit integer. Format:MajorVersion.MinorVersion.Patch.
In this example, the version of our image is1.0.0and we're going to create two replicas in theWest Central USregion, one replica in theSouth Central USregion and one replica in theEast US 2region using zone-redundant storage. The replication regions must include the region the source VM is located.
Replace the value of--virtual-machinein this example with the ID of your VM from the previous step.
--virtual-machine
az sig image-version create \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --gallery-image-definition myImageDefinition \
   --gallery-image-version 1.0.0 \
   --target-regions "westcentralus" "southcentralus=1" "eastus=1=standard_zrs" \
   --replica-count 2 \
   --virtual-machine "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM"
az sig image-version create \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --gallery-image-definition myImageDefinition \
   --gallery-image-version 1.0.0 \
   --target-regions "westcentralus" "southcentralus=1" "eastus=1=standard_zrs" \
   --replica-count 2 \
   --virtual-machine "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM"
Note
You need to wait for the image version to completely finish being built and replicated before you can use the same managed image to create another image version.
You can also store your image in Premium storage by a adding--storage-account-type  premium_lrs, orZone Redundant Storageby adding--storage-account-type  standard_zrswhen you create the image version.
--storage-account-type  premium_lrs
--storage-account-type  standard_zrs
Create the VM
Create the VM usingaz vm createusing the--specializedparameter to indicate the image is a specialized image.
--specialized
Use the image definition ID for--imageto create the VM from the latest version of the image that is available. You can also create the VM from a specific version by supplying the image version ID for--image.
--image
--image
In this example, we're creating a VM from the latest version of themyImageDefinitionimage.
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM2 \
    --image "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/myGalleryRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/images/myImageDefinition" \
    --specialized
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM2 \
    --image "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/myGalleryRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/images/myImageDefinition" \
    --specialized
Share the gallery
You can share images across subscriptions using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). You can share images at the gallery, image definition or image version level. Any user that has read permissions to an image version, even across subscriptions, will be able to deploy a VM using the image version.
We recommend that you share with other users at the gallery level. To get the object ID of your gallery, useaz sig show.
az sig show \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --query id
az sig show \
   --resource-group myGalleryRG \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --query id
Use the object ID as a scope, along with an email address andaz role assignment createto give a user access to the Azure Compute Gallery. Replace<email-address>and<gallery iD>with your own information.
<email-address>
<gallery iD>
az role assignment create \
   --role "Reader" \
   --assignee <email address> \
   --scope <gallery ID>
az role assignment create \
   --role "Reader" \
   --assignee <email address> \
   --scope <gallery ID>
For more information about how to share resources using Azure RBAC, seeAdd or remove Azure role assignments using Azure CLI.
Azure Image Builder
Azure also offers a service, built on Packer,Azure VM Image Builder. Describe your customizations in a template, and it will handle the image creation.
