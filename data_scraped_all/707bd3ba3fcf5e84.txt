This topic lists the attributes that are synchronized by Microsoft Entra Connect Sync.The attributes are grouped by the related Microsoft Entra app.
Attributes to synchronize
A common question iswhat is the list of minimum attributes to synchronize. The default and recommended approach is to keep the default attributes so a full GAL (Global Address List) can be constructed in the cloud and to get all features in Microsoft 365 workloads. In some cases, there are some attributes that your organization does not want synchronized to the cloud since these attributes contain sensitive personal data, like in this example:
In this case, start with the list of attributes in this topic and identify those attributes that would contain personal data and cannot be synchronized. Then deselect those attributes during installation usingMicrosoft Entra app and attribute filtering.
Warning
When deselecting attributes, you should be cautious and only deselect those attributes absolutely not possible to synchronize. Unselecting other attributes might have a negative impact on features.
Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise
Exchange Online
SharePoint Online
Teams and Skype for Business Online
Azure RMS
Intune
Dynamics CRM
3rd party applications
This group is a set of attributes used as the minimal attributes needed for a generic workload or application. It can be used for a workload not listed in another section or for a non-Microsoft app. It is explicitly used for the following:
Yammer (only User is consumed)
Hybrid Business-to-Business (B2B) cross-org collaboration scenarios offered by resources like SharePoint
This group is a set of attributes that can be used if the Microsoft Entra directory is not used to support Microsoft 365, Dynamics, or Intune. It has a small set of core attributes. Note that single sign-on or provisioning to some third-party applications requires configuring synchronization of attributes in addition to the attributes described here. Application requirements are described in theSaaS app tutorialfor each application.
Windows 10
A Windows 10 domain-joined computer(device) synchronizes some attributes to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information on the scenarios, seeConnect domain-joined devices to Microsoft Entra ID for Windows 10 experiences. These attributes always synchronize and Windows 10 does not appear as an app you can unselect. A Windows 10 domain-joined computer is identified by having the attribute userCertificate populated.
These attributes foruserare in addition to the other apps you have selected.
Exchange hybrid writeback
These attributes are written back from Microsoft Entra ID to on-premises Active Directory when you select to enableExchange hybrid. Depending on your Exchange version, fewer attributes might be synchronized.
Exchange Mail Public Folder
These attributes are synchronized from on-premises Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID when you select to enableExchange Mail Public Folder.
Device writeback
Device objects are created in Active Directory. These objects can be devices joined to Microsoft Entra ID or domain-joined Windows 10 computers.
Notes
When using an Alternate ID, the on-premises attribute userPrincipalName is synchronized with the Microsoft Entra attribute onPremisesUserPrincipalName. The Alternate ID attribute, for example mail, is synchronized with the Microsoft Entra attribute userPrincipalName.
Although there is no enforcement of uniqueness on the Microsoft Entra onPremisesUserPrincipalName attribute, it is not supported to sync the same UserPrincipalName value to the Microsoft Entra onPremisesUserPrincipalName attribute for multiple different Microsoft Entra users.
In the lists above, the object typeUseralso applies to the object typeiNetOrgPerson.
