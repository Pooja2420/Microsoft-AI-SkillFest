This article teaches you to configurezone redundancyAzure SQL Managed Instance by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, and REST API.
By using a zone-redundant configuration, you can make your Business Critical or General Purpose instances highly available and resilient to a much larger set of failures, including catastrophic datacenter outages, without any changes to the application logic. You can convert any existing Business Critical or General Purpose instances to the zone-redundant configuration.
Note
Zone-redundancy is currently in public preview for the General Purpose service tier.
Considerations
Consider the following when using zone redundancy for SQL Managed Instance:
Zone redundancy is available inselect regions.
Zone redundancy is currently in public preview for the General Purpose service tier and not currently available for the Next-gen General Purpose service tier.
Zone redundancy can be enabled, and disabled. The operation to enable or disable zone redundancy is a fully onlinescaling operationexecuted in the background.
To enable zone redundancy, your SQL managed instanceBackup storage redundancymust useZone-redundantorGeo-zone-redundantstorage.
New instance
You can create a new zone-redundant instance by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, and REST API.
