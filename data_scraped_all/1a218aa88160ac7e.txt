Azure Load Balancer uses health probes to monitor the health of backend instances. In this article, you learn how to manage health probes for Azure Load Balancer.
There are three types of health probes:
Health probes have the following properties:
Important
Load Balancer health probes originate from the IP address 168.63.129.16 and must not be blocked for probes to mark your instance as up. To see this probe traffic within your backend instance, reviewthe Azure Load Balancer FAQ.
Regardless of configured time-out threshold, HTTP(S) load balancer health probes will automatically mark the instance as down if the server returns any status code that isn't HTTP 200 OK or if the connection is terminated via TCP reset.
