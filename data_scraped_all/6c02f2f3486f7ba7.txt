Application Insights provides a summary in the overview pane to allow at-a-glance assessment of your application's health and performance.

A time range selection is available at the top of the interface.

Each tile can be selected to navigate to the corresponding experience. As an example, selecting theFailed requeststile opens theFailuresexperience.

Application dashboard
The application dashboard uses the existing dashboard technology within Azure to provide a fully customizable single pane view of your application health and performance.
To access the default dashboard, selectApplication Dashboard.

If it's your first time accessing the dashboard, it opens a default view.

You can keep the default view if you like it. Or you can also add and delete from the dashboard to best fit the needs of your team.
Note
All users with access to the Application Insights resource share the sameApplication Dashboardexperience. Changes made by one user will modify the view for all users.
Frequently asked questions
Can I display more than 30 days of data?
No, there's a limit of 30 days of data displayed in a dashboard.
I'm seeing a "resource not found" error on the dashboard
A "resource not found" error can occur if you move or rename your Application Insights instance.
To work around this behavior, delete the default dashboard and selectApplication Dashboardagain to re-create a new one.
Create custom KPI dashboards using Application Insights
You can create multiple dashboards in the Azure portal that include tiles visualizing data from multiple Azure resources across different resource groups and subscriptions. You can pin different charts and views from Application Insights to create custom dashboards that provide you with a complete picture of the health and performance of your application. This tutorial walks you through the creation of a custom dashboard that includes multiple types of data and visualizations from Application Insights.
You learn how to:
Create a custom dashboard in Azure.
Add a tile from theTile Gallery.
Add standard metrics in Application Insights to the dashboard.
Add a custom metric chart based on Application Insights to the dashboard.
Add the results of a Log Analytics query to the dashboard.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial:
Deploy a .NET application to Azure.
Enable theApplication Insights SDK.

Create a new dashboard
Warning
If you move your Application Insights resource over to a different resource group or subscription, you'll need to manually update the dashboard by removing the old tiles and pinning new tiles from the same Application Insights resource at the new location.
A single dashboard can contain resources from multiple applications, resource groups, and subscriptions. Start the tutorial by creating a new dashboard for your application.

Add health overview
A dashboard with static text isn't very interesting, so add a tile from Application Insights to show information about your application. You can add Application Insights tiles from theTile Gallery. You can also pin them directly from Application Insights screens. In this way, you can configure charts and views that you're already familiar with before you pin them to your dashboard.
Start by adding the standard health overview for your application. This tile requires no configuration and allows minimal customization in the dashboard.

Add custom metric chart
You can use theMetricspanel to graph a metric collected by Application Insights over time with optional filters and grouping. Like everything else in Application Insights, you can add this chart to the dashboard. This step does require you to do a little customization first.
