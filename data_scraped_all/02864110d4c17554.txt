This article describes the steps you need to perform in both AWS IAM Identity Center(successor to AWS single sign-On) and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups toAWS IAM Identity Centerusing the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, seeAutomate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID.
Capabilities Supported
Create users in AWS IAM Identity Center
Remove users in AWS IAM Identity Center when they no longer require access
Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and AWS IAM Identity Center
Provision groups and group memberships in AWS IAM Identity Center

Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:
A Microsoft Entra user account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you canCreate an account for free.
One of the following roles:Application AdministratorCloud Application AdministratorApplication Owner.
Application Administrator
Cloud Application Administrator
Application Owner.
A SAML connection from your Microsoft Entra account to AWS IAM Identity Center, as described in Tutorial
Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment

Determine what data tomap between Microsoft Entra ID and AWS IAM Identity Center.

Step 2: Configure AWS IAM Identity Center to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID
Open theAWS IAM Identity Center.
Open theAWS IAM Identity Center.

Step 3: Add AWS IAM Identity Center from the Microsoft Entra application gallery
Add AWS IAM Identity Center from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to AWS IAM Identity Center. If you have previously setup AWS IAM Identity Center for SSO, you can use the same application. Learn more about adding an application from the galleryhere.
Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning
The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to scope who is provisioned based on assignment to the application, or based on attributes of the user or group. If you choose to scope who is provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use thesteps to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who is provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you canuse a scoping filter.
Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify anattribute based scoping filter.

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined inScopein theSettingssection. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running.
Step 6: Monitor your deployment
Once you configure provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:
Use theprovisioning logsto determine which users are provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
Check theprogress barto see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states theapplication provisioning quarantine statusarticle.
Just-in-time (JIT) application access with PIM for groups
With PIM for Groups, you can provide just-in-time access to groups in Amazon Web Services and reduce the number of users that have permanent access to privileged groups in AWS.
Configure your enterprise application for SSO and provisioning
Add AWS IAM Identity Center to your tenant, configure it for provisioning as described in the article above, and start provisioning.
Configuresingle sign-onfor AWS IAM Identity Center.
Create agroupthat provides all users access to the application.
Assign the group to the AWS Identity Center application.
Assign your test user as a direct member of the group created in the previous step, or provide them access to the group through an access package. This group can be used for persistent, non-admin access in AWS.
Enable PIM for groups
Create a second group in Microsoft Entra ID. This group provides access to admin permissions in AWS.
Bring the group undermanagement in Microsoft Entra PIM.
Assign your test user aseligible for the group in PIMwith the role set to member.
Assign the second group to the AWS IAM Identity Center application.
Use on-demand provisioning to create the group in AWS IAM Identity Center.
Sign-in to AWS IAM Identity Center and assign the second group the necessary permissions to perform admin tasks.
Now any end user that was made eligible for the group in PIM can get JIT access to the group in AWS byactivating their group membership.
Key considerations
How long does it take to have a user provisioned to the application?:When a user is added to a group in Microsoft Entra ID outside of activating their group membership using Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM):The group membership is provisioned in the application during the next synchronization cycle. The synchronization cycle runs every 40 minutes.When a user activates their group membership in Microsoft Entra ID PIM:The group membership is provisioned in 2 â 10 minutes. When there is a high rate of requests at one time, requests are throttled at a rate of five requests per 10 seconds.For the first five users within a 10-second period activating their group membership for a specific application, group membership is provisioned in the application within 2-10 minutes.For the sixth user and above within a 10-second period activating their group membership for a specific application, group membership is provisioned to the application in the next synchronization cycle. The synchronization cycle runs every 40 minutes. The throttling limits are per enterprise application.

If the user is unable to access the necessary group in AWS, please review the troubleshooting tips below, PIM logs, and provisioning logs to ensure that the group membership was updated successfully. Depending on how the target application has been architected, it may take additional time for the group membership to take effect in the application.
You can create alerts for failures usingAzure Monitor.
Deactivation is done during the regular incremental cycle. It isn't processed immediately through on-demand provisioning.
Troubleshooting Tips
Missing attributes
When provisioning a user to AWS, they're required to have the following attributes
firstName
lastName
displayName
userName
Users who don't have these attributes fail with the following error

Multi-valued attributes
AWS doesn't support the following multi-valued attributes:
email
phone numbers
Trying to flow the above as multi-valued attributes results in the following error message

There are two ways to resolve this
Ensure the user only has one value for phoneNumber/email
Remove the duplicate attributes. For example, having two different attributes being mapped from Microsoft Entra ID both mapped to "phoneNumber___" on the AWS side  would result in the error if both attributes have values in Microsoft Entra ID. Only having one attribute mapped to a "phoneNumber____ " attribute would resolve the error.
Invalid characters
Currently AWS IAM Identity Center isn't allowing some other characters that Microsoft Entra ID supports like tab (\t), new line (\n), return carriage (\r), and characters such as " <|>|;|:% ".
