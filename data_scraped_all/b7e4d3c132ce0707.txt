Migrate Azure Information Protection labels to the unified labeling platform so that you can use them as sensitivity labels byclients and services that support unified labeling.
Note
If your Azure Information Protection subscription is fairly new, you might not need to migrate labels because your tenant is already on the unified labeling platform.
After you migrate your labels, you won't see any difference with the Azure Information Protection classic client, because this client continues to download the labels with the Azure Information Protection policy from the Azure portal. However, you can now use the labels with the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client and other clients and services that use sensitivity labels.
Before you read the instructions to migrate your labels, you might find the following frequently asked questions useful:
What's the difference between labeling with the built-in labeling solution and labeling with the AIP Office add-in?
Administrative roles that support the unified labeling platform
If you use admin roles for delegated administration in your organization, you might need to do some changes for the unified labeling platform:
TheMicrosoft Entra roleofAzure Information Protection administrator(formerlyInformation Protection administrator) is not supported by the unified labeling platform. If this administrative role is used in your organization to manage Azure Information Protection, add the users who have this role to the Microsoft Entra roles ofCompliance administrator,Compliance data administrator, orSecurity administrator. If you need help with this step, seeGive users access to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. You can also assign these roles in the Microsoft Entra admin center and the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
Alternatively to using roles, in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you can create a new role group for these users and add eitherSensitivity Label AdministratororOrganization Configurationroles to this group.
If you do not give these users access to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal by using one of these configurations, they won't be able to configure Azure Information Protection in the Azure portal after your labels are migrated.
Global administrators for your tenant can continue to manage labels and policies in both the Azure portal and the Microsoft Purview compliance portal after your labels are migrated.
Before you begin
Label migration has many benefits, but is irreversible. Before you migrate, make sure that you are aware of the following changes and considerations:
Client support for unified labeling
Policy configuration
Protection templates
Display names
Localized strings in labels
Editing migrated labels in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Label settings that are not supported in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Comparing the behavior of protection settings for a label
Client support for unified labeling
Make sure that you haveclients that support unified labelsand if necessary, be prepared for administration in both the Azure portal (for clients that don't support unified labels) and the Microsoft Purview compliance portal (for client that do support unified labels).
Policy configuration
Policies, including policy settings and who has access to them (scoped policies), and all advanced client settings are not migrated. Your options to configure these settings after your label migration include the following:
The Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Security & Compliance PowerShell, which you must use toconfigure advanced client settings.
Important
Not all settings from a migrated label are supported by the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Use the table in theLabel settings that are not supported in the Microsoft Purview compliance portalsection to help you identify these settings and the recommended course of action.
Protection templates
Templates that use a cloud-based key and that are part of a label configuration are also migrated with the label. Other protection templates are not migrated.
Templates that use a cloud-based key and that are part of a label configuration are also migrated with the label. Other protection templates are not migrated.
If you have labels that are configured for a predefined template, edit these labels and select theSet permissionsoption to configure the same protection settings that you had in your template. Labels with predefined templates will not block label migration but this label configuration is not supported in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.TipTo help you reconfigure these labels, you might find it useful to have two browser windows: One window in which you select theEdit Templatebutton for the label to view the protection settings, and the other window to configure the same settings when you selectSet permissions.

To help you reconfigure these labels, you might find it useful to have two browser windows: One window in which you select theEdit Templatebutton for the label to view the protection settings, and the other window to configure the same settings when you selectSet permissions.
After a label with cloud-based protection settings has been migrated, the resulting scope of the protection template is the scoped that is defined in the Azure portal (or by using the AIPService PowerShell module) and the scope that is defined in theMicrosoft Purview compliance portal.
After a label with cloud-based protection settings has been migrated, the resulting scope of the protection template is the scoped that is defined in the Azure portal (or by using the AIPService PowerShell module) and the scope that is defined in theMicrosoft Purview compliance portal.
Display names
For each label, the Azure portal displays only the label display name, which you can edit. Users see this label name in their apps.
The Microsoft Purview compliance portal shows both this display name for a label, and the label name. The label name is the initial name that you specify when the label is first created and this property is used by the back-end service for identification purposes. When you migrate your labels, the display name remains the same and the label name is renamed to the label ID from the Azure portal.
Before migrating, ensure that you would not have conflicting display names after migration is complete. Display names in the same place in the labeling hierarchy must be unique.
For example, consider the following list of labels:
Public
General
ConfidentialConfidential\HRConfidential\Finance
Confidential\HR
Confidential\Finance
SecretSecret\HRSecret\Finance
Secret\HR
Secret\Finance
In this list,Public,General,Confidential, andSecretare all parent labels, and cannot have duplicate names. Additionally,Confidential\HRandConfidential\Financeare at the same place in the hierarchy, and also cannot have duplicate names.
However, sub-labels across different parents, such asConfidential\HRandSecret\HRare not at the same place in the hierarchy, and therefore can have the same individual names.
Localized strings in labels
Any localized strings for the labels are not migrated. Define new localized strings for the migrated labels by using Security & Compliance PowerShell and theLocaleSettingsparameter forSet-Label.
Editing migrated labels in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal
After the migration, when you edit a migrated label in the Azure portal, the same change is automatically reflected in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
However, when you edit a migrated label in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you must return to the Azure portal,Azure Information Protection - Unified labelingpane, and selectPublish.
This additional action is needed for the Azure Information Protection clients (classic) to pick up the label changes.
Label settings that are not supported in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal
Use the following table to identify which configuration settings of a migrated label are not supported by the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. If you have labels with these settings, when the migration is complete, use the administration guidance in the final column before you publish your labels in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
If you are not sure how your labels are configured, view their settings in the Azure portal. If you need help with this step, seeConfiguring the Azure Information Protection policy.
Azure Information Protection clients (classic) can use all label settings listed without any problems because they continue to download the labels from the Azure portal.
Comparing the behavior of protection settings for a label
Use the following table to identify how the same protection setting for a label behaves differently, depending on whether it's used by the Azure Information Protection classic client, the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, or by Office apps that have labeling built in (also known as "native Office labeling"). The differences in label behavior might change your decision whether to publish the labels, especially when you have a mix of clients in your organization.
If you are not sure how your protection settings are configured, view their settings in theProtectionpane, in the Azure portal. If you need help with this step, seeTo configure a label for protection settings.
Protection settings that behave the same way are not listed in the table, with the following exceptions:
When you use Office apps with built-in labeling, labels are not visible in File Explorer unless you also install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client.
When you use Office apps with built-in labeling, if protection was previously applied independently from a label, that protection is preserved[1].
In Outlook, protection is preserved with one exception: When an email has been protected with the encrypt-only option (Encrypt), that protection is removed.
Protection is removed if the user has a usage right or role that supports this action:
Theusage rightExport or Full Control.
The role ofRights Management issuer or Rights Management owner, orsuper user.
If the user doesn't have one of these usage rights or roles, the label is not applied and the original protection is preserved.
To migrate Azure Information Protection labels
Use the following instructions to migrate your tenant and Azure Information Protection labels to use the unified labeling store.
You must be a Compliance administrator, Compliance data administrator, Security administrator, or Global administrator to migrate your labels.
If you haven't already done so, open a new browser window andsign in to the Azure portal. Then navigate to theAzure Information Protectionpane.For example, in the search box for resources, services, and docs: Start typingInformationand selectAzure Information Protection.

For the labels that successfully migrated, they can now be used byclients and services that support unified labeling. However, you must firstpublish these labelsin the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
Important
If you edit the labels outside the Azure portal, for Azure Information Protection clients (classic), return to thisAzure Information Protection - Unified labelingpane, and selectPublish.
Copy policies
After you have migrated your labels, you can select an option to copy policies. If you select this option, a one-time copy of your policies with theirpolicy settingsand anyadvanced client settingsis sent to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
Successfully copied policies with their settings and labels are then automatically published to the users and groups that were assigned to the policies in the Azure portal. Note that for the Global policy, this means all users. If you're not ready for the migrated labels in the copied policies to be published, after the policies are copied, you can remove the labels from the label policies in your admin labeling center.
Before you select theCopy policies (preview)option on theAzure Information Protection - Unified labelingpane, be aware of the following:
TheCopy policies (Preview)option is not available until unified labeling is activated for your tenant.
TheCopy policies (Preview)option is not available until unified labeling is activated for your tenant.
You cannot selectively choose policies and settings to copy. All policies (theGlobalpolicy and any scoped policies) are automatically selected to be copied, and all settings that are supported as label policy settings are copied. If you already have a label policy with the same name, it will be overwritten with the policy settings in the Azure portal.

Unlike label migration where subsequent changes to labels are synchronized, theCopy policiesaction doesn't synchronize any subsequent changes to your policies or policy settings. You can repeat the copy policy action after making changes in the Azure portal, and any existing policies and their settings will be overwritten again. Or, use the Set-LabelPolicy or Set-Label cmdlets with theAdvancedSettingsparameter from Security & Compliance PowerShell.

TheCopy policiesaction verifies the following for each policy before it is copied:Users and groups assigned to the policy are currently in Microsoft Entra ID. If one or more account is missing, the policy is not copied. Group membership is not checked.The Global policy contains at least one label. Because the admin labeling centers don't support label policies without labels, a Global policy without labels is not copied.
