Reporting
New Dashboard directory experience
We've listened to your feedback and are thrilled to introduce the new Dashboard directory experience. It not only features a modern UI design but also enables you to sort by each column, with the addition of theLast Configuredcolumn. This column will provide you with better insights into overall dashboard usage within your organization. Additionally, you can now filter by team or project-level dashboards, allowing you to access only the list of what you need to see while hiding the dashboards you donât want to view.
