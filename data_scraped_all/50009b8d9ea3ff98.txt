Note
The Red Hat Linux Enterprise software reservation plans and renewals are temporarily unavailable due to pending updates to reservation SKUs and pricing. You can disregard any renewal emails until the new plan is available. In the meantime, you can contact your Microsoft or Red Hat Sales Representative to ask about other options until the new plan is available.
When you prepay for your SUSE and RedHat software usage in Azure, you can save money over your pay-as-you-go costs. The discounts only apply to SUSE and RedHat meters and not on the virtual machine usage. You can buy reservations for virtual machines separately for additional savings.
You can buy SUSE and RedHat software plans in the Azure portal. To buy a plan:
To buy a reservation, you must have owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription.
For Enterprise subscriptions, theAdd Reserved Instancesoption must be enabled in theEA portal. If the setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin for the subscription.
For the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, the admin agents or sales agents can buy the software plans.

Self-service cancellation and exchanges not allowed
You can't cancel or exchange a SUSE or RedHat plan that you bought yourself.
