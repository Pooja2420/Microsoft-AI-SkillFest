Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets enable better elasticity for your workloads throughAutoscale, so you can configure when your infrastructure scales-out and when it scales-in. Scale sets also enable you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs through differentupgrade policysettings. You can configure an update on the scale set model and the new configuration is applied automatically to every scale set instance if you've set the upgrade policy to Automatic or Rolling.
As your application processes traffic, there can be situations where you want specific instances to be treated differently from the rest of the scale set instance. For example, certain instances in the scale set could be performing long-running operations, and you don't want these instances to be scaled-in until the operations complete. You might also have specialized a few instances in the scale set to perform additional or different tasks than the other members of the scale set. You require these 'special' VMs not to be modified with the other instances in the scale set. Instance protection provides the additional controls to enable these and other scenarios for your application.
This article describes how you can apply and use the different instance protection capabilities with scale set instances.
Types of instance protection
Scale sets provide two types of instance protection capabilities:
Protect from scale-inEnabled throughprotectFromScaleInproperty on the scale set instanceProtects instance from Autoscale initiated scale-inUser-initiated instance operations (including instance delete) arenot blockedOperations initiated on the scale set (upgrade, reimage, deallocate, etc.) arenot blocked
Protect from scale-in
Enabled throughprotectFromScaleInproperty on the scale set instance
Protects instance from Autoscale initiated scale-in
User-initiated instance operations (including instance delete) arenot blocked
Operations initiated on the scale set (upgrade, reimage, deallocate, etc.) arenot blocked
Protect from scale set actionsEnabled throughprotectFromScaleSetActionsproperty on the scale set instanceProtects instance from Autoscale initiated scale-inProtects instance from operations initiated on the scale set (such as upgrade, reimage, deallocate, etc.)User-initiated instance operations (including instance delete) arenot blockedDelete of the full scale set isnot blocked
Protect from scale set actions
Enabled throughprotectFromScaleSetActionsproperty on the scale set instance
Protects instance from Autoscale initiated scale-in
Protects instance from operations initiated on the scale set (such as upgrade, reimage, deallocate, etc.)
User-initiated instance operations (including instance delete) arenot blocked
Delete of the full scale set isnot blocked
Protect from scale-in
Instance protection can be applied to scale set instances after the instances are created. Protection is applied and modified only on theinstance modeland not on thescale set model.
There are multiple ways of applying scale-in protection on your scale set instances as detailed in the examples below.
Azure portal
You can apply scale-in protection through the Azure portal to an instance in the scale set. You cannot adjust more than one instance at a time. Repeat the steps for each instance you want to protect.
Go to an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set.
SelectInstancesfrom the menu on the left, underSettings.
Select the name of the instance you want to protect.
Select theProtection Policytab.
In theProtection Policyblade, select theProtect from scale-inoption.
SelectSave.
REST API
The following example applies scale-in protection to an instance in the scale set.
PUT on `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{vmScaleSetName}/virtualMachines/{instance-id}?api-version=2019-03-01`
PUT on `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/{vmScaleSetName}/virtualMachines/{instance-id}?api-version=2019-03-01`
{
  "properties": {
    "protectionPolicy": {
      "protectFromScaleIn": true
    }
  }        
}
{
  "properties": {
    "protectionPolicy": {
      "protectFromScaleIn": true
    }
  }        
}
Note
With Flexible orchestration mode, instance protection is only supported with API version 2023-09-01 and above. For Uniform orchestration mode, instance protection is available with API version 2019-03-01 and above.
Azure PowerShell
Use theUpdate-AzVmssVMcmdlet to apply scale-in protection to your scale set instance.
The following example applies scale-in protection to an instance in the scale set having instance ID 0.
Update-AzVmssVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -VMScaleSetName "myVMScaleSet" `
  -InstanceId 0 `
  -ProtectFromScaleIn $true
Update-AzVmssVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -VMScaleSetName "myVMScaleSet" `
  -InstanceId 0 `
  -ProtectFromScaleIn $true
Azure CLI 2.0
Useaz vmss updateto apply scale-in protection to your scale set instance.
The following example applies scale-in protection to an instance in the scale set having instance ID 0.
az vmss update \  
  --resource-group <myResourceGroup> \
  --name <myVMScaleSet> \
  --instance-id 0 \
  --protect-from-scale-in true
az vmss update \  
  --resource-group <myResourceGroup> \
  --name <myVMScaleSet> \
  --instance-id 0 \
  --protect-from-scale-in true
Protect from scale set actions
Instance protection can be applied to scale set instances after the instances are created. Protection is applied and modified only on theinstance modeland not on thescale set model.
Protecting an instance from scale set actions also protects the instance from Autoscale initiated scale-in.

}
Note
Instance protection is only supported with API version 2019-03-01 and above.Protecting an instance from scale set actions also protects the instance from Autoscale initiated scale-in. You can't specify "protectFromScaleIn": false when setting "protectFromScaleSetActions": true
Azure PowerShell
Use theUpdate-AzVmssVMcmdlet to apply protection from scale set actions to your scale set instance.
The following example applies protection from scale set actions to an instance in the scale set having instance ID 0.
Update-AzVmssVM `
  -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
  -VMScaleSetName "myVMScaleSet" `
  -InstanceId 0 `

Useaz vmss updateto apply protection from scale set actions to your scale set instance.

az vmss update \  
  --resource-group <myResourceGroup> \

Troubleshoot
No protectionPolicy on scale set model
Instance protection is only applicable on scale set instances and not on the scale set model.
No protectionPolicy on scale set instance model
By default, protection policy is not applied to an instance when it is created.
You can apply instance protection to scale set instances after the instances are created.
Not able to apply instance protection
Instance protection is only supported with API version 2019-03-01 and above. Check the API version being used and update as required. You might also need to update your PowerShell or CLI to the latest version.
