You can use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) In Microsoft Entra ID to have just-in-time membership in the group or just-in-time ownership of the group.
This article is for eligible members or owners who want to activate their group membership or ownership in PIM.
Important
When a group membership or ownership is activated, Microsoft Entra PIM temporarily adds an active assignment. Microsoft Entra PIM creates an active assignment (adds user as member or owner of the group) within seconds. When deactivation (manual or through activation time expiration) happens, Microsoft Entra PIM removes userâs group membership or ownership within seconds as well.
Application may provide access to users based on their group membership. In some situations, application access may not immediately reflect the fact that user was added to the group or removed from it. If application previously cached the fact that user is not member of the group â when user tries to access application again, access may not be provided. Similarly, if application previously cached the fact that user is member of the group â when group membership is deactivated, user may still get access. Specific situation depends on the applicationâs architecture. For some applications, signing out and signing back in may help to get access added or removed.
PIM for Groups and ownership deactivation
Microsoft Entra ID doesn't allow you to remove the last (active) owner of a group. For example, consider a group that has active owner A and eligible owner B. If user B activates their ownership with PIM and then later user A is removed from the group or from the tenant, deactivation of user B's ownership won't succeed.
PIM will try to deactivate user B's ownership for up to 30 days. If another active owner C is added to the group, the deactivation will succeed. If deactivation is unsuccessful after 30 days, PIM will stop trying to deactivate user B's ownership and user B will continue to be an active owner.
Activate a role
When you need to take on a group membership or ownership, you can request activation by using theMy rolesnavigation option in PIM.
