Overview
Azure Application Gateway supports end-to-end encryption of traffic. Application Gateway terminates the TLS/SSL connection at the application gateway. The gateway then applies the routing rules to the traffic, re-encrypts the packet, and forwards the packet to the appropriate backend server based on the routing rules defined. Any response from the web server goes through the same process back to the end user.
Application Gateway supports defining custom TLS options. It also supports disabling the following protocol versions:TLSv1.0,TLSv1.1, andTLSv1.2, as well defining which cipher suites to use and the order of preference. To learn more about configurable TLS options, see theTLS policy overview.
Note
SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 are disabled by default and cannot be enabled. They are considered unsecure and cannot be used with Application Gateway.

Scenario
In this scenario, you learn how to create an application gateway by using end-to-end TLS with PowerShell.
This scenario will:
Create a resource group namedappgw-rg.
Create a virtual network namedappgwvnetwith an address space of10.0.0.0/16.
Create two subnets calledappgwsubnetandappsubnet.
Create a small application gateway supporting end-to-end TLS encryption that limits TLS protocol versions and cipher suites.
Before you begin
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
To configure end-to-end TLS with an application gateway, a certificate is required for the gateway and certificates are required for the backend servers. The gateway certificate is used to derive a symmetric key as per TLS protocol specification. The symmetric key is then used encrypt and decrypt the traffic sent to the gateway. The gateway certificate needs to be in Personal Information Exchange (PFX) format. This file format allows you to export the private key that is required by the application gateway to perform the encryption and decryption of traffic.
For end-to-end TLS encryption, the back end must be explicitly allowed by the application gateway. Upload the public certificate of the backend servers to the application gateway. Adding the certificate ensures that the application gateway only communicates with known backend instances. This further secures the end-to-end communication.
The configuration process is described in the following sections.
Create the resource group
This section walks you through creating a resource group that contains the application gateway.

Create a virtual network and a subnet for the application gateway
The following example creates a virtual network and two subnets. One subnet is used to hold the application gateway. The other subnet is used for the back ends that host the web application.
Assign an address range for the subnet to be used for the application gateway.$gwSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'appgwsubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24NoteSubnets configured for an application gateway should be properly sized. An application gateway can be configured for up to 10 instances. Each instance takes one IP address from the subnet. Too small of a subnet can adversely affect scaling out an application gateway.

Create a public IP address for the frontend configuration
Create a public IP resource to be used for the application gateway. This public IP address is used in one of the steps that follow.
$publicip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName appgw-rg -Name 'publicIP01' -Location "West US" -AllocationMethod Dynamic
$publicip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName appgw-rg -Name 'publicIP01' -Location "West US" -AllocationMethod Dynamic
Important
Application Gateway doesn't support the use of a public IP address created with a defined domain label. Only a public IP address with a dynamically created domain label is supported. If you require a friendly DNS name for the application gateway, we recommend you use a CNAME record as an alias.
Create an application gateway configuration object
All configuration items are set before creating the application gateway. The following steps create the configuration items that are needed for an application gateway resource.
Create an application gateway IP configuration. This setting configures which of the subnets the application gateway uses. When application gateway starts, it picks up an IP address from the configured subnet and routes network traffic to the IP addresses in the backend IP pool. Keep in mind that each instance takes one IP address.$gipconfig = New-AzApplicationGatewayIPConfiguration -Name 'gwconfig' -Subnet $gwSubnet

$gipconfig = New-AzApplicationGatewayIPConfiguration -Name 'gwconfig' -Subnet $gwSubnet
$gipconfig = New-AzApplicationGatewayIPConfiguration -Name 'gwconfig' -Subnet $gwSubnet
Create a frontend IP configuration. This setting maps a private or public IP address to the front end of the application gateway. The following step associates the public IP address in the preceding step with the frontend IP configuration.$fipconfig = New-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig -Name 'fip01' -PublicIPAddress $publicip

$fipconfig = New-AzApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig -Name 'fip01' -PublicIPAddress $publicip
Configure the backend IP address pool with the IP addresses of the backend web servers. These IP addresses are the IP addresses that receive the network traffic that comes from the frontend IP endpoint. Replace the IP addresses in the sample with your own application IP address endpoints.$pool = New-AzApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool -Name 'pool01' -BackendIPAddresses 203.0.113.1, 203.0.113.2, 203.0.113.3NoteA fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is also a valid value to use in place of an IP address for the backend servers. You enable it by using the-BackendFqdnsswitch.

Note
A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is also a valid value to use in place of an IP address for the backend servers. You enable it by using the-BackendFqdnsswitch.

Configure the certificate for the application gateway. This certificate is used to decrypt and reencrypt the traffic on the application gateway.$passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString  <certificate file password> -AsPlainText -Force 
$cert = New-AzApplicationGatewaySSLCertificate -Name cert01 -CertificateFile <full path to .pfx file> -Password $passwdNoteThis sample configures the certificate used for the TLS connection. The certificate needs to be in .pfx format.

Upload the certificate to be used on the TLS-enabled backend pool resources.NoteThe default probe gets the public key from thedefaultTLS binding on the backend's IP address and compares the public key value it receives to the public key value you provide here.If you're using host headers and Server Name Indication (SNI) on the back end, the retrieved public key might not be the intended site to which traffic flows. If you're in doubt, visithttps://127.0.0.1/on the backend servers to confirm which certificate is used for thedefaultTLS binding. Use the public key from that request in this section. If you're using host-headers and SNI on HTTPS bindings and you do not receive a response and certificate from a manual browser request tohttps://127.0.0.1/on the backend servers, you must set up a default TLS binding on the them. If you do not do so, probes fail and the back end is not allowed.For more information about SNI in Application Gateway, seeOverview of TLS termination and end to end TLS with Application Gateway.$authcert = New-AzApplicationGatewayAuthenticationCertificate -Name 'allowlistcert1' -CertificateFile C:\cert.cerNoteThe certificate provided in the previous step should be the public key of the .pfx certificate present on the back end. Export the certificate (not the root certificate) installed on the backend server in Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (CER) format and use it in this step.

Get an application gateway DNS name
After the gateway is created, the next step is to configure the front end for communication. Application Gateway requires a dynamically assigned DNS name when using a public IP, which is not friendly. To ensure end users can hit the application gateway, you can use a CNAME record to point to the public endpoint of the application gateway. For more information, seeConfiguring a custom domain name for in Azure.
To configure an alias, retrieve details of the application gateway and its associated IP/DNS name by using thePublicIPAddresselement attached to the application gateway. Use the application gateway's DNS name to create a CNAME record that points the two web applications to this DNS name. We don't recommend the use of A-records, because the VIP can change on restart of the application gateway.
