This article describes how to configure backup for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server using Azure portal.
Prerequisites
Before you configure backup for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
Review the supported scenarios and known limitationsof Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible server backup.
Identify orcreate a Backup vaultin the same region where you want to back up the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server instance.
Check that Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server is named in accordance with naming guidelines for Azure Backup. Learn about thenaming conventions.
Allow access permissions for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server. Learn about theaccess permissions.
Create a back up policy.
Configure backup  for the database
To configure backup for Azure PostgreSQL â Flexible Server using Azure Backup, you can use one of the following methods:
Azure PostgreSQL â Flexible Server: Database manage pane
Backup vault
Azure Business Continuity Center
To configure backup on the Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server via Azure Business Continuity Center, follow these steps:
Go toBusiness Continuity Center, and then selectOverview>+ Configure protection.Alternatively, for configuring backup from theBackup vaultpane, go to theBackup vault>Overview, and then select+ Backup.To configure backup from theDatabase managepane, go to thePostgreSQL - flexible serverpane, and then selectSettings>LTR (Vaulted Backups).
Go toBusiness Continuity Center, and then selectOverview>+ Configure protection.

Alternatively, for configuring backup from theBackup vaultpane, go to theBackup vault>Overview, and then select+ Backup.
To configure backup from theDatabase managepane, go to thePostgreSQL - flexible serverpane, and then selectSettings>LTR (Vaulted Backups).

On theConfigure Backuppane, on theBasicstab, check ifDatasource typeappears asAzure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers, clickSelect vaultunderVaultand choose an existing Backup vault from the dropdown list, and then selectNext.If you don't have a Backup vault,create a new one.

On theBackup policytab, select a Backup policy that defines the backup schedule and the retention duration, and then selectNext.If you don't have a Backup policy,create one on the go.

On theSelect resources to backuppane, select the Azure PostgreSQL â Flexible Servers to back up, and then clickSelect.NoteEnsure that you choose the Azure PostgreSQL â flexible Servers in the same region as that of the vault.Once you're on theDatasourcestab,  the Azure Backup service validates if it has all the necessary access permissions to connect to the server. If one or more access permissions are missing, one of the following  error messages appears âUser cannot assign rolesorRole assignment not done.User cannot assign roles: This message appears when you (the backup admin) donât have thewrite accesson the PostgreSQL - flexible Server as listed underView details. To assign the necessary permissions on the required resources, selectDownload role assignment templateto fetch the ARM template,  and run the template as a PostgreSQL database administrator. Once the template is run successfully, selectRevalidate.Role assignment not done: This message appears when you (the backup admin) have thewrite accesson the PostgreSQL â flexible Server to assign missing permissions as listed underView details. To grant permissions on the PostgreSQL - flexible Server inline, selectAssign missing roles.Once the process starts, themissing access permissionson the PostgreSQL â flexible servers are granted to the backup vault. You can define the scope at which the access permissions must be granted. When the action is complete, revalidation starts.

Create a backup policy
You can create a backup policy on the go during the backup configuration flow.
To create a backup policy, follow these steps:
On theConfigure Backuppane, select theBackup policytab.
On theConfigure Backuppane, select theBackup policytab.
On theBackup policytab, selectCreate newunderBackup policy.
On theBackup policytab, selectCreate newunderBackup policy.
On theCreate Backup Policypane, on theBasicstab,  provide a name for the new policy onPolicy name.
On theCreate Backup Policypane, on theBasicstab,  provide a name for the new policy onPolicy name.

On theSchedule + retentiontab, underBackup schedule, define the Backup frequency.
On theSchedule + retentiontab, underBackup schedule, define the Backup frequency.
UnderRetention rules, selectAdd retention rule.
UnderRetention rules, selectAdd retention rule.

On theAdd retentionpane, define the retention period, and then selectAdd.NoteThe default retention period forWeeklybackup is10 years. You can add retention rules for specific backups, including data store and retention duration.
On theAdd retentionpane, define the retention period, and then selectAdd.
Note
The default retention period forWeeklybackup is10 years. You can add retention rules for specific backups, including data store and retention duration.

Once you are on theCreate Backup Policypane, selectReview + create.NoteThe retention rules are evaluated in a pre-determined order of priority. The priority is the highest for the yearly rule, followed by the monthly, and then the weekly rule. Default retention settings are applied when no other rules qualify. For example, the same recovery point may be the first successful backup taken every week as well as the first successful backup taken every month. However, as the monthly rule priority is higher than that of the weekly rule, the retention corresponding to the first successful backup taken every month applies.

When the backup configuration is complete, you canrun an on-demand backupandtrack the progress of the backup operation.
