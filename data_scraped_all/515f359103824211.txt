When you onboard Microsoft Sentinel, your first step is to select your Log Analytics workspace. While you can get the full benefit of the Microsoft Sentinel experience with a single workspace, in some cases, you might want to extend your workspace to query and analyze your data across workspaces and tenants. For more information, seeDesign a Log Analytics workspace architectureandPrepare for multiple workspaces and tenants in Microsoft Sentinel.
If you onboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Microsoft Defender portal, see:
Multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces in the Defender portal
Microsoft Defender multitenant management
Manage incidents on multiple workspaces
In the Azure and Defender portals, the incidents view allows you to centrally manage and monitor incidents across multiple workspaces or filter the view by workspace.  Manage incidents directly or drill down transparently to the incident details in the context of the originating workspace.
If you're working in the Azure portal, seemultiple workspace incident view. For the Defender portal, seeMultiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces in the Defender portal.
Query multiple workspaces
Querymultiple workspacesto search and correlate data from multiple workspaces in a single query.
Use theworkspace( )expression, with the workspace identifier as the argument, to refer to a table in a different workspace. Use explicit identifier formats to ensure best performance. For more information, seeIdentifier formats for cross workspace queries.

Use savedfunctionsto simplify cross-workspace queries. For example, you can shorten a long reference to theSecurityEventtable in Customer A's workspace by saving the expression:workspace("/subscriptions/<customerA_subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspaceName>").SecurityEventas a function calledSecurityEventCustomerA. You can then query Customer A'sSecurityEventtable with this function:SecurityEventCustomerA | where ....

A function can also simplify a commonly used union. For example, you can save the following expression as a function calledunionSecurityEvent:union 
workspace("/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspaceName1>").SecurityEvent, 
workspace("/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspaceName2>").SecurityEventThen, write a query across both workspaces by beginning withunionSecurityEvent | where ....

Include cross-workspace queries in scheduled analytics rules
You can include cross-workspace queries in scheduled analytics rules. You can use cross-workspace analytics rules in a central SOC, and across tenants (using Azure Lighthouse), suitable for MSSPs. This use is subject to the following limitations:
You can includeup to 20 workspacesin a single query. However, for good performance, we recommend including no more than 5.
You must deploy Microsoft Sentinelon every workspacereferenced in the query.
Alerts generated by a cross-workspace analytics rule, and the incidents created from them, existonly in the workspace where the rule was defined. The alerts won't be displayed in any of the other workspaces referenced in the query.
A cross-workspace analytics rule, like any analytics rule, will continue running even if the user who created the rule loses access to workspaces referenced in the rule's query. The only exception to this is in thecase of workspaces in different subscriptions and/or tenantsthan the analytics rule.
Alerts and incidents created by cross-workspace analytics rules contain all the related entities, including those from all the referenced workspaces and the "home" workspace (where the rule was defined). This way, analysts get a full picture of alerts and incidents.
Note
Querying multiple workspaces in the same query might affect performance, and therefore is recommended only when the logic requires this functionality.
Use cross-workspace workbooks
Workbooks provide dashboards and apps to Microsoft Sentinel. When working with multiple workspaces, workbooks provide monitoring and actions across workspaces.
Workbooks can provide cross-workspace queries in one of three methods, suitable for different levels of end-user expertise:
Hunt across multiple workspaces
Microsoft Sentinel provides preloaded query samples designed to get you started and get you familiar with the tables and the query language. Microsoft security researchers constantly add new built-in queries and fine-tune existing queries. You can use these queries to look for new detections and identify signs of intrusion that your security tools might have missed.
Cross-workspace hunting capabilities enable your threat hunters to create new hunting queries, or adapt existing ones, to cover multiple workspaces, by using the union operator and the workspace() expression as shownabove.
Manage multiple workspaces using automation
To configure and manage multiple Log Analytics workspaces enabled for Microsoft Sentinel, you need to automate the use of the Microsoft Sentinel management API.
Learn how toautomate the deployment of Microsoft Sentinel resources, including alert rules, hunting queries, workbooks, and playbooks.
Learn how todeploy custom content from your repository. This resource provides a consolidated methodology for managing Microsoft Sentinel as code and for deploying and configuring resources from a private Azure DevOps or GitHub repository.
Manage workspaces across tenants

In many scenarios, the different Log Analytics workspaces enabled for Microsoft Sentinels can be located in different Microsoft Entra tenants. You can useAzure Lighthouseto extend all cross-workspace activities across tenant boundaries, allowing users in your managing tenant to work on workspaces across all tenants.
Once Azure Lighthouse isonboarded, use thedirectory + subscription selectoron the Azure portal to select all the subscriptions containing workspaces you want to manage, in order to ensure that they'll all be available in the different workspace selectors in the portal.
When using Azure Lighthouse, it's recommended to create a group for each Microsoft Sentinel role and delegate permissions from each tenant to those groups.
If you're using the Defender portal, multitenant management for Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel provides your security operation teams with a single, unified view of all the tenants you manage. For more information, seeMicrosoft Defender multitenant management.
