This article provides a list of known issues and troubleshooting steps associated with the Azure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio.
Important
The latest version of Integration Runtime (5.28.8488) prevents access to a network file share on a local host. This security measure will lead to failures when performing migrations to Azure SQL using DMS. Please ensure you run Integration Runtime on a different machine than the network share hosting.
Error code: 2007 - CutoverFailedOrCancelled

Cause: The error can occur due to the backups being placed incorrectly in the Azure Storage container. If the backups are placed in the network file share, this error could also occur due to network connectivity issues.

Recommendation: Ensure the database backups in your Azure Storage container are correct. If you're using network file share, there can be network-related issues and lags that are causing this error. Wait for the process to be completed.

Message:Cutover failed or cancelled for database '{databaseName}'. Error details: 'Migration cannot be completed because provided backup file name '{providedFileName}' should be the last restore backup file '{lastRestoredFileName}'.'

Cutover failed or cancelled for database '{databaseName}'. Error details: 'Migration cannot be completed because provided backup file name '{providedFileName}' should be the last restore backup file '{lastRestoredFileName}'.'
Cause: This error occurs due to a known limitation in SqlMi. It means the '{providedFileName}' is different from '{lastRestoredFileName}'. SqlMi will automatically restore all valid backup files in the container based on the LSN sequence. A typical failure case could be: the '{providedFileName}' is "log1", but the files in container has other files, like "log2", which have largest LSN number than "log1". In this case, SqlMi will automatically restore all files in the container. In the end of completing the migration, SqlMi will report this error message.

Azure Database Migration Service Naming Rules
If your DMS service failed with "Error: Service name 'x_y_z' is not valid", then you need to follow the Azure Database Migration Service Naming Rules. As Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Data factory for its compute, it follows the exact same naming rules as mentioned in thenaming rules.
Azure SQL Database limitations
Migrating to Azure SQL Database by using the Azure SQL extension for Azure Data Studio has the following limitations:
Azure SQL Database offline migration utilizes Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines for data movement and thus abides by ADF limitations. A corresponding ADF is created when a database migration service is also created. Thus factory limits apply per service.
The machine where the SHIR is installed acts as the compute for migration. Make sure this machine can handle the cpu and memory load of the data copy. To learn more, reviewSHIR recommendations.
100,000 table per database limit.
10,000 concurrent database migrations per service.
Migration speed heavily depends on the target Azure SQL Database SKU and the self-hosted Integration Runtime host.
Azure SQL Database migration scales poorly with table numbers due to ADF overhead in starting activities. If a database has thousands of tables, the startup process of each table might take a couple of seconds, even if they're composed of one row with 1 bit of data.
Azure SQL Database table names with double-byte characters currently aren't supported for migration. Mitigation is to rename tables before migration; they can be changed back to their original names after successful migration.
Tables with large blob columns might fail to migrate due to timeout.
Database names with SQL Server reserved are currently not supported.
Database names that include semicolons are currently not supported.
Computed columns don't get migrated.
Azure SQL Managed Instance limitations
Migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance by using the Azure SQL extension for Azure Data Studio has the following limitations:
If migrating a single database, the database backups must be placed in a flat-file structure inside a database folder (including the container root folder), and the folders can't be nested, as it's not supported.
If migrating multiple databases using the same Azure Blob Storage container, you must place backup files for different databases in separate folders inside the container.
Overwriting existing databases using DMS in your target Azure SQL Managed Instance isn't supported.
DMS doesn't support configuring high availability and disaster recovery on your target to match the source topology.
The following server objects aren't supported:SQL Server Agent jobsCredentialsSSIS packagesServer audit
SQL Server Agent jobs
Credentials
SSIS packages
Server audit
You can't use an existing self-hosted integration runtime created from Azure Data Factory for database migrations with DMS. Initially, the self-hosted integration runtime should be created using the Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio and can be reused for further database migrations.
A single LRS job (created by DMS) can run for a maximum of 30 days. When this period expires, the job is automatically canceled thus your target database gets automatically deleted.
If you received the following error:Memory-optimized filegroup must be empty in order to be restored on General Purpose tier of SQL Database Managed Instance. This issue is by design, Hekaton (also known as SQL Server In-Memory OLTP) isn't supported on General Purpose tier of Azure SQL Managed Instance. To continue migration, one way is to upgrade to Business Critical tier, which supports Hekaton. Another way is to make sure the source database isn't using it while the Azure SQL Managed Instance is General Purpose.
Memory-optimized filegroup must be empty in order to be restored on General Purpose tier of SQL Database Managed Instance
SQL Server on Azure VMs limitations
Migrating to SQL Server on Azure VMs by using the Azure SQL extension for Azure Data Studio has the following limitations:
If migrating a single database, the database backups must be placed in a flat-file structure inside a database folder (including container root folder), and the folders can't be nested, as it's not supported.
If migrating multiple databases using the same Azure Blob Storage container, you must place backup files for different databases in separate folders inside the container.
Overwriting existing databases using DMS in your target SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine isn't supported.

You can't use an existing self-hosted integration runtime created from Azure Data Factory for database migrations with DMS. Initially, the self-hosted integration runtime should be created using the Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio and can be reused for further database migrations.
VM with SQL Server 2008 and below as target versions aren't supported when migrating to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
If you're using a VM with SQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2014, you need to store your source database backup files on an Azure Storage Blob Container instead of using the network share option. Store the backup files as page blobs since block blobs are only supported in SQL 2016 and after.
You must make sure the SQL IaaS Agent Extension in the target Azure Virtual Machine is inFull modeinstead of Lightweight mode.
SQL IaaS Agent Extension only supports management of Default Server Instance or Single Named Instance.
You can migrate a maximum of 100 databases to the same Azure SQL Server Virtual Machine as the target using one or more migrations simultaneously. Moreover, once a migration(s) with 100 databases finishes, wait for at least 30 minutes before starting a new migration to the same Azure SQL Server Virtual Machine as the Target. Also, every migration operation (start migration, cutover) for each database will take few mins sequentially. For example, to migrate 100 databases, it can take approx. 200 (2 x 100) minutes to create the migration queue/s and approx. 100 (1 x 100) minutes to cutover all 100 databases (excluding backup and restore timing). Therefore, the migration will become slower as the number of databases increases. Microsoft advises either scheduling a longer migration window in advance based on rigorous migration testing or partitioning large number of databases into batches when migrating them to a SQL server Azure VM.
Apart from configuring the Networking/Firewall of your Azure Storage Account to allow your VM to access backup files. You also need to configure the Networking/Firewall of your SQL Server on Azure VM to allow outbound connection to your storage account.
You need to keep the target SQL Server on Azure VMpower ONwhile the SQL Migration is in progress. Also, when creating a new migration, failover or cancel the migration.
