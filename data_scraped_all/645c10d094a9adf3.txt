Virtual Network service endpoint policies allow you to filter egress virtual network traffic to Azure Storage accounts over service endpoint, and allow data exfiltration to only specific Azure Storage accounts. Endpoint policies provide granular access control for virtual network traffic to Azure Storage when connecting over service endpoint.

This feature is generally available forAzure Storageinall global Azure regions.
Key benefits
Virtual network service endpoint policies provide following benefits:
Improved security for your Virtual Network traffic to Azure StorageAzure service tags for network security groupsallow you to restrict virtual network outbound traffic to specific Azure Storage regions. However, this process allows traffic to any account within selected Azure Storage region.Endpoint policies allow you to specify the Azure Storage accounts that are allowed virtual network outbound access and restricts access to all the other storage accounts. This process gives much more granular security control for protecting data exfiltration from your virtual network.

Scalable, highly available policies to filter Azure service trafficEndpoint policies provide horizontally scalable, highly available solution to filter Azure service traffic from virtual networks, over service endpoints. No extra overhead is required to maintain central network appliances for this traffic in your virtual networks.

Configuration
You can configure the endpoint policies to restrict virtual network traffic to specific Azure Storage accounts.

Endpoint policy is configured on a subnet in a virtual network. Service endpoints for Azure Storage should be enabled on the subnet to apply the policy.

Endpoint policy allows you to add specific Azure Storage accounts to allowlist, using the resourceID format. You can restrict access to:All storage accounts in a subscriptionE.g. /subscriptions/subscriptionIdAll storage accounts in a resource groupE.g. subscriptions/subscriptionId/resourceGroups/resourceGroupNameAn individual storage account by listing the corresponding Azure Resource Manager resourceId. This covers traffic to blobs, tables, queues, files and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.E.g. /subscriptions/subscriptionId/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/storageAccountName

By default, if no policies are attached to a subnet with endpoints, you can access all storage accounts in the service. Once a policy is configured on that subnet, only the resources specified in the policy can be accessed from compute instances in that subnet. Access to all other storage accounts is denied.

When Service Endpoint policies are applied on a subnet, the Azure StorageService Endpoint scopegets upgraded from regional toglobal. This process means that all the traffic to Azure Storage is secured over service endpoint thereafter. The Service endpoint policies are also applicable globally. Any storage accounts that aren't explicitly allowed are denied access.

Any storage accounts that aren't explicitly allowed are denied access.
You can apply multiple policies to a subnet. When multiple policies are associated to the subnet, virtual network traffic to resources specified across any of these policies are allowed. Access to all other service resources, not specified in any of the policies, are denied.

Note
Service endpoint policies areallow policies, so apart from the specified resources, all other resources are restricted. Please ensure that all service resource dependencies for your applications are identified and listed in the policy.
Only storage accounts using the Azure Resource Model can be specified in the endpoint policy. Classic Azure Storage accounts don't support Azure Service Endpoint Policies.

Filtering traffic to Azure services from on-premises:
Service endpoint policies only apply to the traffic from subnets associated to the policies. To allow access to specific Azure service resources from on-premises, traffic should be filtered using network virtual appliances or firewalls.

Logging and troubleshooting
No centralized logging is available for service endpoint policies. For service resource logs, seeService endpoints logging.
Troubleshooting scenarios
Access denied to storage accounts that were working in preview (not in geo-paired region)With Azure Storage upgrading to use Global Service Tags, the scope of Service Endpoint and thus Service Endpoint policies is now Global. So any traffic to Azure Storage is encrypted over Service Endpoints and only Storage accounts that are explicitly listed in policy are allowed access.Explicitly allowlist all the required Storage accounts to restore access.Contact Azure support.

Provisioning
A user with write access to a virtual network configures service endpoint policies on subnets. Learn more about Azurebuilt-in rolesand assigning specific permissions tocustom roles.
Virtual networks and Azure Storage accounts can be in the same or different subscriptions, or Microsoft Entra tenants.
Limitations
You can only deploy service endpoint policies on virtual networks deployed through the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.

Azure managed services other than Azure SQL Managed Instance don't currently support endpoint policies. This limitation includes managed services deployed into shared subnets (such asAzure Batch, Microsoft Entra Domain Services, Azure Application Gateway, Azure VPN Gateway, Azure Firewall) or into dedicated subnets (such asAzure App Service Environment, Azure Redis Cache, Azure API Management, classic managed services).

Warning
Azure services deployed into your virtual network, such as Azure HDInsight, access other Azure services, such as Azure Storage, for infrastructure requirements. Restricting endpoint policy to specific resources could break access to these infrastructure resources for the Azure services deployed in your virtual network.
Classic storage accounts aren't supported in endpoint policies. Policies deny access to all classic storage accounts, by default. If your application needs access to Azure Resource Manager and classic storage accounts, endpoint policies shouldn't be used for this traffic.
Pricing and limits
There's no extra charge for using service endpoint policies. The current pricing model for Azure services (such as, Azure Storage) applies as is today, over service endpoints.
Following limits are enforced on service endpoint policies:
