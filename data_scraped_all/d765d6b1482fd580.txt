Azure Monitor collects metric data from your container app at regular intervals to help you gain insights into the performance and health of your container app.
The metrics explorer in the Azure portal allows you to visualize the data. You can also retrieve raw metric data through theAzure CLIand AzurePowerShell cmdlets.
Available metrics
Container Apps provides these basic metrics.
UsageNanoCores

The metrics namespace isMicrosoft.App/containerapps.
Microsoft.App/containerapps
Note
Replica restart count is the aggregate restart count over the specified time range, not the number of restarts that occurred at a point in time.
Container Apps environments provides this basic metric. You can only view this metric inAzure Monitor metrics.
NodeCount
The metrics namespace isMicrosoft.App/managedEnvironments.

More runtime specific metrics are available,Java metrics.
Metrics snapshots
Select theMonitoringtab on your app'sOverviewpage to display charts showing your container app's current CPU, memory, and network utilization.

From this view, you can pin one or more charts to your dashboard or select a chart to open it in the metrics explorer.
Using metrics explorer
The Azure Monitor metrics explorer lets you create charts from metric data to help you analyze your container app's resource and network usage over time. You can pin charts to a dashboard or in a shared workbook.
Open the metrics explorer in the Azure portal by selectingMetricsfrom the sidebar menu on your container app's page. To learn more about metrics explorer, seeAnalyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer.

Create a chart by selectingMetric. You can modify the chart by changing aggregation, adding more metrics, changing time ranges and intervals, adding filters, and applying splitting.

Add filters
Optionally, you can create filters to limit the data shown based on revisions and replicas.
To create a filter:
SelectAdd filter.
SelectAdd filter.
Select a revision or replica from thePropertylist.
Select a revision or replica from thePropertylist.
Select values from theValuelist.
Select values from theValuelist.
Split metrics
When your chart contains a single metric, you can choose to split the metric information by revision or replica with the exceptions:
TheReplica countmetric can only split by revision.
TheRequestsmetric can also be split on the status code and status code category.
To split by revision or replica:
SelectApply splitting.
SelectApply splitting.
From theValuesdrop-down list, selectRevisionorReplica.
From theValuesdrop-down list, selectRevisionorReplica.
You can set the limit of the number of revisions or replicas to display in the chart. The default value is 10.
