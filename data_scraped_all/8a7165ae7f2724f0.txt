Inputs
forceReinstallCredentialProvider-Reinstall the credential provider even if already installedboolean. Default value:false.
forceReinstallCredentialProvider
boolean
false
Optional. Reinstalls the credential provider to the user profile directory, even if it's already installed. If the credential provider is already installed in the user profile, the task determines if it is overwritten with the task-provided credential provider. This may upgrade (or potentially downgrade) the credential provider.
nuGetServiceConnections-Service connection credentials for feeds outside this organizationstring.
nuGetServiceConnections
string
Optional. The comma-separated list ofNuGet service connectionnames for feeds outside this organization or collection. For feeds in this organization or collection, leave this blank; the build's credentials are used automatically.
Task control options
All tasks have control options in addition to their task inputs. For more information, seeControl options and common task properties.
Output variables
None.
Remarks
Important
This task is only compatible with NuGet >= 4.8.0.5385, dotnet >= 6, or MSBuild >= 15.8.166.59604.
What tools are compatible with this task?
This task configures tools that supportNuGet cross platform plugins. The tools currently include nuget.exe, dotnet, and recent versions of MSBuild with built-in support for restoring NuGet packages.
Specifically, this task will configure:
nuget.exe (version 4.8.5385 or higher)
dotnet / .NET 6 SDK or higher (a previous version of this task, NuGetAuthenticateV0, requires .NET Core 2.1, which is no longer supported)
MSBuild (version 15.8.166.59604 or higher)
Upgrading to the latest stable version is recommended if you encounter any issues.
I get "A task was canceled" errors during a package restore. What should I do?
Known issues in NuGet and in the Azure Artifacts Credential Provider can cause this type of error, and updating to the latest nuget may help.
Aknown issuein some versions of nuget/dotnet can cause this error, especially during large restores on resource constrained machines. This issue is fixed inNuGet 5.2, and .NET Core SDK 2.1.80X and 2.2.40X. If you are using an older version, try upgrading your version of NuGet or dotnet. The.NET Core Tool Installertask can be used to install a newer version of the .NET Core SDK.
There are also known issues with the Azure Artifacts Credential Provider (installed by this task), includingartifacts-credprovider/#77andartifacts-credprovider/#108. If you experience these issues, ensure you have the latest credential provider by setting the inputforceReinstallCredentialProvidertotruein the NuGet Authenticate task. This setting will also ensure your credential provider is automatically updated as issues are resolved.
forceReinstallCredentialProvider
true
If neither of the above resolves the issue, enablePlugin Diagnostic Loggingand report the issue toNuGetand theAzure Artifacts Credential Provider.
How is this task different than the NuGetCommand and DotNetCoreCLI tasks?
This task configures nuget.exe, dotnet, and MSBuild to authenticate with Azure Artifacts or other repositories that require authentication.
After this task runs, you can then invoke the tools in a later step (either directly or via a script) to restore or push packages.
The NuGetCommand and DotNetCoreCLI tasks require using the task to restore or push packages, as authentication to Azure Artifacts is only configured within the lifetime of the task. This can prevent you from restoring or pushing packages within your own script. It may also prevent you from passing specific command line arguments to the tool.
The NuGetAuthenticate task is the recommended way to use authenticated feeds within a pipeline.
When in my pipeline should I run this task?
This task must run before you use a NuGet tool to restore or push packages to an authenticated package source such as Azure Artifacts. There are no other ordering requirements. For example, this task can safely run either before or after a NuGet or .NET Core tool installer task.
How do I configure a NuGet package source that uses ApiKey ("NuGet API keys"), such as nuget.org?
Some package sources such as nuget.org use API keys for authentication when pushing packages, rather thanusername/passwordcredentials. Due to limitations in NuGet, this task cannot be used to set up a NuGet service connection that uses an API key.
username/password
Instead:
Configure asecret variablecontaining the ApiKey
Perform the package push usingnuget push -ApiKey $(myNuGetApiKey)ordotnet nuget push --api-key $(myNuGetApiKey), assuming you named the variablemyNuGetApiKey
nuget push -ApiKey $(myNuGetApiKey)
dotnet nuget push --api-key $(myNuGetApiKey)
myNuGetApiKey
My agent is behind a web proxy. Will NuGetAuthenticate set up nuget.exe, dotnet, and MSBuild to use my proxy?
No. While this task itself will work behind a web proxyyour agent has been configured to use, it does not configure NuGet tools to use the proxy.
To do so, you can either:
Set the environment variablehttp_proxyand optionallyno_proxyto your proxy settings. SeeNuGet CLI environment variablesfor details. These variables are commonly used variables which other non-NuGet tools (e.g. curl) may also use.Caution:Thehttp_proxyandno_proxyvariables are case-sensitive on Linux and Mac operating systems and must be lowercase. Attempting to use an Azure Pipelines variable to set the environment variable will not work, as it will be converted to uppercase. Instead, set the environment variables on the self-hosted agent's machine and restart the agent.

How do I debug if I have issues with this task?
To get verbose logs from the pipeline, add a pipeline variablesystem.debugand set totrue.
system.debug
true
How does this task work?
This task installs theAzure Artifacts Credential Providerinto the NuGet plugins directory if it is not already installed. It then sets environment variables such asVSS_NUGET_URI_PREFIXESandVSS_NUGET_ACCESSTOKENto configure the credential provider. These variables remain set for the lifetime of the job. When restoring or pushing packages, a NuGet tool executes the credential provider, which uses the above variables to determine if it should return credentials back to the tool.
VSS_NUGET_URI_PREFIXES
VSS_NUGET_ACCESSTOKEN
See the credential provider documentation for more details.
My Pipeline needs to access a feed in a different project
If the pipeline is running in a different project than the project hosting the feed, you must set up the other project to grant read/write access to the build service. SeePackage permissions in Azure Pipelinesfor more details.
Will this work for pipeline runs that are triggered from an external fork?
No. Pipeline runs that are triggered from an external fork don't have access to the proper secrets for internal feed authentication. Thus, it will appear like the authenticate task is successful, but subsequent tasks that require authentication (such as Nuget push) will fail with an error along the lines of:##[error]The nuget command failed with exit code(1) and error(Response status code does not indicate success: 500 (Internal Server Error - VS800075: The project with id 'vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/341ec244-e856-40ad-845c-af31c33c2152' does not exist, or you do not have permission to access it. (DevOps Activity ID: C12C19DC-642C-469A-8F58-C89F2D81FEA7)).After the Pull Request is merged into the origin, then a pipeline that is triggered from that event will authenticate properly.
##[error]The nuget command failed with exit code(1) and error(Response status code does not indicate success: 500 (Internal Server Error - VS800075: The project with id 'vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/341ec244-e856-40ad-845c-af31c33c2152' does not exist, or you do not have permission to access it. (DevOps Activity ID: C12C19DC-642C-469A-8F58-C89F2D81FEA7)).
I updated from NuGetAuthenticateV0 to NuGetAuthenticateV1 and now my dotnet command fails with 401
If you are updating from NuGetAuthenticateV0 to NuGetAuthenticateV1 and get an error running a dotnet command, look for the messageIt was not possible to find any compatible framework versionfrom the logs. For dotnet users, NuGetAuthenticateV1 requires .NET 6 instead of .NET Core 2.1, which is required in NuGetAuthenticateV0 and is no longer supported. To resolve the issue, use the UseDotNet@2 task before the dotnet command to install .NET 6.

Restore and push NuGet packages within your organization
If all of the Azure Artifacts feeds you use are in the same organization as your pipeline, you can use the NuGetAuthenticate task without specifying any inputs. For project scoped feeds that are in a different project than where the pipeline is running in, you must manually give the project and the feed access to the pipeline's project's build service.
