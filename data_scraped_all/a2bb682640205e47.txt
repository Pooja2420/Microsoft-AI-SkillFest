Parameters
bool
Returns
The function returns the cumulative sum of its argument.
Examples
The following example shows how to calculate the cumulative sum of the first
few even integers.
Run the query
datatable (a:long) [
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
]
| where a%2==0
| serialize cs=row_cumsum(a)
datatable (a:long) [
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
]
| where a%2==0
| serialize cs=row_cumsum(a)
This example shows how to calculate the cumulative sum (here, ofsalary)
when the data is partitioned (here, byname):
salary
name
Run the query
datatable (name:string, month:int, salary:long)
[
    "Alice", 1, 1000,
    "Bob",   1, 1000,
    "Alice", 2, 2000,
    "Bob",   2, 1950,
    "Alice", 3, 1400,
    "Bob",   3, 1450,
]
| order by name asc, month asc
| extend total=row_cumsum(salary, name != prev(name))
datatable (name:string, month:int, salary:long)
[
    "Alice", 1, 1000,
    "Bob",   1, 1000,
    "Alice", 2, 2000,
    "Bob",   2, 1950,
    "Alice", 3, 1400,
    "Bob",   3, 1450,
]
| order by name asc, month asc
| extend total=row_cumsum(salary, name != prev(name))
