Register your SQL Server VM with theSQL IaaS Agent extensionto unlock a wealth of feature benefits for your SQL Server on Azure Windows VM.
This article teaches you to register a single SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension. Alternatively, you can register all SQL Server VMs in a subscriptionautomaticallyormultiple VMs in bulk using a script.
Note
SQL Server VMs deployed via the Azure marketplace after October 2022 have theleast privileged modelenabled by default.Management modesfor the SQL IaaS Agent extension were removed in March 2023.
Overview
Registering with theSQL Server IaaS Agent extensioncreates theSQL virtual machineresourcewithin your subscription, which is aseparateresource from the virtual machine resource. Deleting the extension from your SQL Server VM removes theSQL virtual machineresourcebut doesn't drop the actual virtual machine.
Deploying a SQL Server VM Azure Marketplace image through the Azure portal automatically registers the SQL Server VM with the extension, which includesregistering the subscriptionwith theMicrosoft.SqlVirtualMachineresource provider (RP), if it's not already registered. However, if you choose to self-install SQL Server on an Azure virtual machine, or provision an Azure virtual machine from a custom VHD, then you must register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension to unlock full feature benefits and manageability. By default, Azure VMs that have SQL Server 2016 or later installed will be automatically registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension when detected by theCEIP service.  See theSQL Server privacy supplementfor more information. For information about privacy, see theSQL IaaS Agent extension privacy statements.
Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine
To utilize the SQL IaaS Agent extension, you must firstregister your subscription with theMicrosoft.SqlVirtualMachineprovider, which gives the SQL IaaS Agent extension the ability to create resources within that specific subscription. Then you can register your SQL Server VM with the extension.
Prerequisites
To register your SQL Server VM with the extension, you'll need the following:
AnAzure subscription.
An Azure Resource ModelsupportedWindows Server virtual machinewith asupportedSQL Serverversion deployed to the public or Azure Government cloud.
Ensure the Azure VM is running.
The client credentials used to register the virtual machine exists in any of the following Azure roles:Virtual Machine contributor,Contributor, orOwner.
The latest version ofAzure CLIorAzure PowerShell (5.0 minimum).
A minimum of .NET Framework 4.5.1 or later.
To verify that none of thelimitationsapply to you.
Register subscription with RP
To register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension, you must first register your subscription with theMicrosoft.SqlVirtualMachineresource provider (RP). This gives the SQL IaaS Agent extension the ability to create resources within your subscription. You can do so by using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.
Azure portal
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
Register your subscription with the resource provider by using the Azure portal:
Open the Azure portal and go toAll Services.
Open the Azure portal and go toAll Services.
Go toSubscriptionsand select the subscription of interest.
Go toSubscriptionsand select the subscription of interest.
On theSubscriptionspage, selectResource providersunderSettings.

SelectRegister,Re-register, orUnregisterfor theMicrosoft.SqlVirtualMachineprovider, depending on your desired action.
SelectRegister,Re-register, orUnregisterfor theMicrosoft.SqlVirtualMachineprovider, depending on your desired action.

Register your subscription with the resource provider by using Azure PowerShell:
# Register the SQL IaaS Agent extension to your subscription
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine
# Register the SQL IaaS Agent extension to your subscription
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine
Register your subscription with the resource provider by using the Azure CLI:
# Register the SQL IaaS Agent extension to your subscription
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine
# Register the SQL IaaS Agent extension to your subscription
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine
Register with extension
You can manually register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension by using Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
Provide the SQL Server license type as either pay-as-you-go (PAYG) to pay per usage, Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHUB) to use your own license, or disaster recovery (DR) to activate thefree DR replica license.

Register a SQL Server VM with Azure PowerShell:
# Get the existing Compute VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>

# Register SQL Server VM with the extension
New-AzSqlVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
-LicenseType <license_type>
# Get the existing Compute VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>

# Register SQL Server VM with the extension
New-AzSqlVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
-LicenseType <license_type>
Register a SQL Server with the Azure CLI:
# Register SQL Server VM with the extension
az sql vm create --name <vm_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --location <vm_location> --license-type <license_type>
# Register SQL Server VM with the extension
az sql vm create --name <vm_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --location <vm_location> --license-type <license_type>
It's not currently possible to register your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension by using the Azure portal.
Verify registration status
You can verify if your SQL Server VM has already been registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension by using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.
Azure portal
Azure PowerShell
Azure CLI
Verify the registration status with the Azure portal:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Go to yourSQL Server VMs.
Go to yourSQL Server VMs.
Select your SQL Server VM from the list. If your SQL Server VM isn't listed here, it likely hasn't been registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension.

View the value underStatus. IfStatusisSucceeded, then the SQL Server VM has been registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension successfully.
View the value underStatus. IfStatusisSucceeded, then the SQL Server VM has been registered with the SQL IaaS Agent extension successfully.

Alternatively, you can check the status by choosingRepairunder theSupport + troubleshootingpane in theSQL virtual machineresource. The provisioning state for the SQL IaaS Agent extension can beSucceededorFailed.
Verify current SQL Server VM registration status by using Azure PowerShell.ProvisioningStateshows asSucceededif registration was successful.

An error indicates that the SQL Server VM hasn't been registered with the extension.
Delete the extension
To unregister your SQL Server VM with the SQL IaaS Agent extension, delete the SQL virtual machineresourceby using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. Deleting the SQL virtual machineresourcedoesn't delete the SQL Server VM.
Warning
Use extreme cautionwhen deleting the extension from your SQL Server VM. Follow the steps carefully becauseit is possible to inadvertently delete the virtual machinewhen attempting to remove theresource.
