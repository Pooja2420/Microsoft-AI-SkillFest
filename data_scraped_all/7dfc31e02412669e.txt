Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity allows cost savings for the vault-standard tier by providing discounts on backup storage when committing to a one- or three-year reservation. A reservation provides a fixed amount of backup storage capacity for the term of the reservation. The savings depend on the reservation term, total reserved capacity, vault tier, and chosen redundancy type. Reserved capacity reduces costs without impacting Azure Backup Storage resources.
For information about Azure Backup pricing, seeAzure Backup pricing page.
Reservation terms for Azure Storage
The following sections describe the terms of an Azure Backup Storage reservation.
You can purchase Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity in units of 100 TiB and 1 PiB per month for a one-year or three-year term.
Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity is available for a single subscription, multiple subscriptions (shared scope), and management groups.
When scoped to a single subscription, the reservation discount is applied only to the selected subscription.
When scoped to multiple subscriptions, the reservation discount is shared across those subscriptions within your billing context.
When scoped to management group, the reservation discount is shared across the subscriptions that are a part of management group and billing scope.
When you purchase Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity, you can use your reservation for backup data stored in the vault-standard tier only. A reservation is applied to your usage within the purchased scope and canât be limited to a specific storage account, container, or object within the subscription.
An Azure Backup Storage reservation covers only the amount of data that's stored in a subscription or shared resource group. Early deletion, operations, bandwidth, and data transfer charges arenât included in the reservation. As soon as you purchase a reservation, you're charged for the capacity charges that match the reservation attributes at the discount rates, instead of pay-as-you-go rates. For more information on Azure reservations, seeWhat are Azure Reservations?
Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity is available for backup data stored in the vault-standard tier.
LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, and ZRS redundancies are supported for reservations. For more information about redundancy options, seeAzure Storage redundancy.
Note
Azure Backup Storage reserved capacity isn't applicable for Protected Instance cost. It's also not applicable to vault-archive tier.
To purchase reserved capacity:
To buy a reservation, you must have owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription.
For Enterprise subscriptions, the policy to add reserved instances must be enabled. For direct EA agreements, the Reserved Instances policy must be enabled in the Azure portal. For indirect EA agreements, the Add Reserved Instances policy must be enabled in the EA portal. Or, if those policy settings are disabled, you must be an EA Admin on the subscription.
For the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, only admin agents or sales agents can purchase Azure Backup Blob Storage reserved capacity.
Determine required capacity before purchase
When you purchase an Azure Backup Storage reservation, you must choose the reservationâs region, vault tier, and redundancy option. Your reservation is valid only for data stored in that region, vault tier, and redundancy level. For example, you purchase a reservation for data in US West for the vault-standard tier using geo-redundant storage (GRS). You can't use the same reservation for data in US East, or data in locally redundant storage (LRS). However, you can purchase another reservation for your additional needs.
Reservations are currently available for 100 TiB or 1 PiB blocks, with higher discounts for 1 PiB blocks. When you purchase a reservation in the Azure portal, Microsoft may provide you with recommendations based on your previous usage to help determine which reservation you should purchase.

You'll receive an email notification 30 days prior to the expiration of the reservation, and again on the expiration date. To continue taking advantage of the cost savings that a reservation provides, renew it no later than the expiration date.
