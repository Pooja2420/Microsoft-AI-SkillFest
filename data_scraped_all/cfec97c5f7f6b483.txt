In this document, you learn how to configure a private endpoint for your Azure Machine Learning workspace. For information on creating a virtual network for Azure Machine Learning, seeVirtual network isolation and privacy overview.
Azure Private Link enables you to restrict connections to your workspace to an Azure Virtual Network. You restrict a workspace to only accept connections from a virtual network by creating a private endpoint. The private endpoint is a set of private IP addresses within your virtual network. You can then limit access to your workspace to only occur over the private IP addresses. A private endpoint helps reduce the risk of data exfiltration. To learn more about private endpoints, see theAzure Private Linkarticle.
Warning
Securing a workspace with private endpoints does not ensure end-to-end security by itself. You must secure all of the individual components of your solution. For example, if you use a private endpoint for the workspace, but your Azure Storage Account is not behind the VNet, traffic between the workspace and storage does not use the VNet for security.
For more information on securing resources used by Azure Machine Learning, see the following articles:
Virtual network isolation and privacy overview.
Secure workspace resources.
Secure training environments.
Secure the inference environment.
Use Azure Machine Learning studio in a VNet.
API platform network isolation.
Prerequisites
You must have an existing virtual network to create the private endpoint in.WarningDo not use the 172.17.0.0/16 IP address range for your VNet. This is the default subnet range used by the Docker bridge network, and will result in errors if used for your VNet. Other ranges may also conflict depending on what you want to connect to the virtual network. For example, if you plan to connect your on premises network to the VNet, and your on-premises network also uses the 172.16.0.0/16 range. Ultimately, it is up toyouto plan your network infrastructure.

Limitations
If you enable public access for a workspace secured with private endpoint and use Azure Machine Learning studio over the public internet, some features such as the designer might fail to access your data. This problem happens when the data is stored on a service that is secured behind the virtual network. For example, an Azure Storage Account.

Using a private endpoint doesn't affect Azure control plane (management operations) such as deleting the workspace or managing compute resources. For example, creating, updating, or deleting a compute target. These operations are performed over the public Internet as normal. Data plane operations, such as using Azure Machine Learning studio, APIs (including published pipelines), or the SDK use the private endpoint.

When you use a workspace with multiple private endpoints, one of the private endpoints must be in the same virtual network as the following dependency services:Azure Storage Account that provides the default storage for the workspaceAzure Key Vault for the workspaceAzure Container Registry for the workspace.For example, one virtual network ('services') would contain a private endpoint for the dependency services and the workspace. This configuration allows the workspace to communicate with the services. Another virtual network ('clients') might only contain a private endpoint for the workspace, and be used only for communication between client development machines and the workspace.

Azure CLI

APPLIES TO:Azure CLI ml extensionv2 (current)
When you use the Azure CLIextension 2.0 CLI for machine learning, a YAML document is used to configure the workspace. The following example demonstrates creating a new workspace using a YAML configuration:
Tip
When you use a private link, your workspace cannot use Azure Container Registry tasks compute for image building. Instead, the workspace defaults to using aserverless compute clusterto build images. This works only when the workspace-deependent resources such as the storage account and container registry are not under any network restrictions (private endpoint). If your workspace dependencies are under network restrictions, use theimage_build_computeproperty to specify a compute cluster to use for image building.
Theimage_build_computeproperty in this configuration specifies a CPU compute cluster name to use for Docker image environment building. You can also specify whether the private link workspace should be accessible over the internet using thepublic_network_accessproperty.
image_build_compute
image_build_compute
public_network_access
In this example, the compute referenced byimage_build_computewill need to be created before building images.

From the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the portal, selectSettings,Networking,Private endpoint connectionsand then select+ Private endpoint. Use the fields to create a new private endpoint.
When selecting theRegion, select the same region as your virtual network.
When selecting theVirtual network, select the virtual network you want to connect to.
When selecting theSubnet, select the subnet in the virtual network that the private endpoint IP addresses are assigned from.
You can leave other fields at the default value or modify as needed for your environment. Finally, selectCreateto create the private endpoint.
Remove a private endpoint
You can remove one or all private endpoints for a workspace. Removing a private endpoint removes the workspace from the virtual network that the endpoint was associated with. Removing the private endpoint might prevent the workspace from accessing resources in that virtual network, or resources in the virtual network from accessing the workspace. For example, if the virtual network doesn't allow access to or from the public internet.
Warning
Removing the private endpoints for a workspacedoesn't make it publicly accessible. To make the workspace publicly accessible, use the steps in theEnable public accesssection.
To remove a private endpoint, use the following information:
Azure CLI
Portal
APPLIES TO:Azure CLI ml extensionv2 (current)
When using the Azure CLIextension 2.0 CLI for machine learning, use the following command to remove the private endpoint:
az network private-endpoint delete \
    --name <private-endpoint-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
az network private-endpoint delete \
    --name <private-endpoint-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
From theAzure portal, select your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
From the left side of the page, selectNetworkingand then select thePrivate endpoint connectionstab.
Select the endpoint to remove and then selectRemove.

Enable public access
In some situations, you might want to allow someone to connect to your secured workspace over a public endpoint, instead of through the virtual network. Or you might want to remove the workspace from the virtual network and re-enable public access.
Important
Enabling public access doesn't remove any private endpoints that exist. All communications between components behind the VNet that the private endpoint(s) connect to are still secured. It enables public access only to the workspace, in addition to the private access through any private endpoints.
Warning
When connecting over the public endpoint while the workspace uses a private endpoint to communicate with other resources:
Some features of studio will fail to access your data. This problem happens when thedata is stored on a service that is secured behind the VNet. For example, an Azure Storage Account. To resolve this problem, add your client device's IP address to theAzure Storage Account's firewall.
Using Jupyter, JupyterLab, RStudio, or Posit Workbench (formerly RStudio Workbench) on a compute instance, including running notebooks,is not supported.
To enable public access, use the following steps:
Tip
There are two possible properties that you can configure:
allow_public_access_when_behind_vnet- used by the Python SDK v1
allow_public_access_when_behind_vnet
public_network_access- used by the CLI and Python SDK v2
Each property overrides the other. For example, settingpublic_network_accesswill override any previous setting toallow_public_access_when_behind_vnet.

SelectEnabled from all networks, and then selectSave.

Enable Public Access only from internet IP ranges
You can use IP network rules to allow access to your workspace and endpoint from specific public internet IP address ranges by creating IP network rules. Each Azure Machine Learning workspace supports up to 200 rules. These rules grant access to specific internet-based services and on-premises networks and block general internet traffic.
Warning

Securely connect to your workspace
To connect to a workspace that's secured behind a VNet, use one of the following methods:
Azure VPN gateway- Connects on-premises networks to the VNet over a private connection. Connection is made over the public internet. There are two types of VPN gateways that you might use:Point-to-site: Each client computer uses a VPN client to connect to the VNet.Site-to-site: A VPN device connects the VNet to your on-premises network.

Point-to-site: Each client computer uses a VPN client to connect to the VNet.
Site-to-site: A VPN device connects the VNet to your on-premises network.
ExpressRoute- Connects on-premises networks into the cloud over a private connection. Connection is made using a connectivity provider.
ExpressRoute- Connects on-premises networks into the cloud over a private connection. Connection is made using a connectivity provider.
Azure Bastion- In this scenario, you create an Azure Virtual Machine (sometimes called a jump box) inside the VNet. You then connect to the VM using Azure Bastion. Bastion allows you to connect to the VM using either an RDP or SSH session from your local web browser. You then use the jump box as your development environment. Since it is inside the VNet, it can directly access the workspace. For an example of using a jump box, seeTutorial: Create a secure workspace.

When using aVPN gatewayorExpressRoute, you will need to plan how name resolution works between your on-premises resources and those in the VNet. For more information, seeUse a custom DNS server.
If you have problems connecting to the workspace, seeTroubleshoot secure workspace connectivity.
Multiple private endpoints
Azure Machine Learning supports multiple private endpoints for a workspace. Multiple private endpoints are often used when you want to keep different environments separate. The following are some scenarios that are enabled by using multiple private endpoints:
Client development environments in a separate virtual network.
Client development environments in a separate virtual network.
An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in a separate virtual network.
An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in a separate virtual network.
Other Azure services in a separate virtual network. For example, Azure Synapse and Azure Data Factory can use a Microsoft managed virtual network. In either case, a private endpoint for the workspace can be added to the managed virtual network used by those services. For more information on using a managed virtual network with these services, see the following articles:Synapse managed private endpointsAzure Data Factory managed virtual network.ImportantSynapse's data exfiltration protectionis not supported with Azure Machine Learning.

Important
Synapse's data exfiltration protectionis not supported with Azure Machine Learning.
Important
Each VNet that contains a private endpoint for the workspace must also be able to access the Azure Storage Account, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry used by the workspace. For example, you might create a private endpoint for the services in each VNet.
Adding multiple private endpoints uses the same steps as described in theAdd a private endpoint to a workspacesection.
Scenario: Isolated clients
If you want to isolate the development clients, so they don't have direct access to the compute resources used by Azure Machine Learning, use the following steps:
Note
These steps assume that you have an existing workspace, Azure Storage Account, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry. Each of these services has a private endpoints in an existing VNet.
Create another virtual network for the clients. This virtual network might contain Azure Virtual Machines that act as your clients, or it might contain a VPN Gateway used by on-premises clients to connect to the virtual network.
Add a new private endpoint for the Azure Storage Account, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry used by your workspace. These private endpoints should exist in the client virtual network.
If you have another storage that is used by your workspace, add a new private endpoint for that storage. The private endpoint should exist in the client virtual network and have private DNS zone integration enabled.
Add a new private endpoint to your workspace. This private endpoint should exist in the client virtual network and have private DNS zone integration enabled.
To enable Azure Machine Learning studio to access the storage accounts, visit thestudio in a virtual networkarticle.
The following diagram illustrates this configuration. TheWorkloadvirtual network contains compute resources created by the workspace for training & deployment. TheClientvirtual network contains clients or client ExpressRoute/VPN connections. Both VNets contain private endpoints for the workspace, Azure Storage Account, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry.

Scenario: Isolated Azure Kubernetes Service
If you want to create an isolated Azure Kubernetes Service used by the workspace, use the following steps:
Note
These steps assume that you have an existing workspace, Azure Storage Account, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry. Each of these services has a private endpoints in an existing VNet.
Create an Azure Kubernetes Service instance. During creation, AKS creates a virtual network that contains the AKS cluster.
Add a new private endpoint for the Azure Storage Account, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry used by your workspace. These private endpoints should exist in the client virtual network.
If you have other storage that is used by your workspace, add a new private endpoint for that storage. The private endpoint should exist in the client virtual network and have private DNS zone integration enabled.
Add a new private endpoint to your workspace. This private endpoint should exist in the client virtual network and have private DNS zone integration enabled.
Attach the AKS cluster to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more information, seeCreate and attach an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

Scenario: Managed online endpoints with access from selected IP addresses
Enabling inbound access from selected IP addresses is affected by the ingress setting on your managed online endpoints. If public ingress is enabled on your managed online endpoint, then you can't enable selected IP addresses on our workspace.
The following table shows the possible configurations for your workspace and managed online endpoint network configurations, and how it affects both. For more information, seeNetwork isolation with managed online endpoints.
Note
If the workspace public network access configuration is changed from selected IPs to disabled, the managed online enedpoints will continue to respect the selected IPs. If you do not want thee selected IPs applied to your online endpoints, remove the addresses before selectingDisabledfor the workspace in the Azure portal. The Python SDK and Azure CLI support this change after or before.
Scenario: Batch endpoints with access from selected IP addresses
The selected IP's configuration isn't supported for batch endpoints. There's no public network access flag on batch endpoints. If the Azure Machine Learning workspace is disabled, and private link enabled, the batch endpoint is private as well. If the workspace's public network access is changed from disabled to enabled, the batch endpoints stay private and don't become public. For more information, seeSecuring batch endpoints.
