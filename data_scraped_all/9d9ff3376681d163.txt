Manage user-assigned managed identities

Managed identities for Azure resources eliminate the need to manage credentials in code. You can use them to get a Microsoft Entra token for your applications. The applications can use the token when accessing resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Azure manages the identity so you don't have to.
There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned. System-assigned managed identities have their lifecycle tied to the resource that created them. This identity is restricted to only one resource, and you can grant permissions to the managed identity by using Azure role-based access control (RBAC).  User-assigned managed identities can be used on multiple resources. To learn more about managed identities, seeWhat are managed identities for Azure resources?.
In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out theoverview section. Be sure to review thedifference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity.

Important
To modify user permissions when you use an app service principal by using the CLI, you must provide the service principal more permissions in the Azure Active Directory Graph API because portions of the CLI perform GET requests against the Graph API. Otherwise, you might end up receiving an "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation" message. To do this step, go into theApp registrationin Microsoft Entra ID, select your app, selectAPI permissions, and scroll down and selectAzure Active Directory Graph. From there, selectApplication permissions, and then add the appropriate permissions.
Create a user-assigned managed identity
To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs theManaged Identity Contributorrole assignment.
Use theaz identity createcommand to create a user-assigned managed identity. The-gparameter specifies the resource group where to create the user-assigned managed identity. The-nparameter specifies its name. Replace the<RESOURCE GROUP>and<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>parameter values with your own values.

In this article, you create a user-assigned managed identity by using Azure Resource Manager.

If you don't already have an Azure account,sign up for a free accountbefore you continue.
You can't list and delete a user-assigned managed identity by using a Resource Manager template. See the following articles to create and list a user-assigned managed identity:
List user-assigned managed identity

Template creation and editing
Resource Manager templates help you deploy new or modified resources defined by an Azure resource group. Several options are available for template editing and deployment, both local and portal-based. You can:
Use acustom template from Azure Marketplaceto create a template from scratch or base it on an existing common orquickstart template.
Derive from an existing resource group by exporting a template. You can export them from eitherthe original deploymentor from thecurrent state of the deployment.
Use a localJSON editor (such as VS Code), and then upload and deploy by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
Use the Visual StudioAzure Resource Group projectto create and deploy a template.
Create a user-assigned managed identity
To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs theManaged Identity Contributorrole assignment.
To create a user-assigned managed identity, use the following template. Replace the<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>value with your own values.
<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
