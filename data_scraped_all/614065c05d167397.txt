For multi-node systems, select whether the cluster is cabled to use a network switch for the storage network traffic:No switch for storage- For systems with storage network adapters that connect all the machines directly without going through a switch.Network switch for storage traffic- For systems with storage network adapters connected to a network switch. This also applies to systems that use converged network adapters that carry all traffic types including storage.

Choose traffic types to group together on a set of network adaptersâand which types to keep physically isolated on their own adapters.There are three types of traffic we're configuring:Managementtraffic between this system, your management PC, and Azure; also Storage Replica traffic.Computetraffic to or from VMs and containers on this system.Storage(SMB) traffic between machines in a multi-node system.If you selectedNo switchfor storage, the following networking patterns are available:Group management and compute trafficCustom configurationIf you selected aNetwork switchfor storage, more patterns are available based on how you intend to group the traffic:Group all traffic- If you're using network switches for storage traffic you can group all traffic types together on a set of network adapters.Group management and compute traffic- This groups management and compute traffic together on one set of adapters while keeping storage traffic isolated on dedicated high-speed adapters. You create two network intents:Management and compute intent.Storage intent.Group compute and storage traffic- If you're using network switches for storage traffic, you can group compute and storage traffic together on your high-speed adapters while keeping management traffic isolated on another set of adapters. You create two network intents:Management intent.Compute and storage intent.Custom configuration- Finally you can do a custom configuration that lets you group traffic differently, such as carrying each traffic type on its own set of adapters. You also create corresponding custom intents.TipIf you're deploying a single machine that you plan to add machines to later, select the network traffic groupings you want for the eventual cluster. Then when you add machines they automatically get the appropriate settings.

Tip
If you're deploying a single machine that you plan to add machines to later, select the network traffic groupings you want for the eventual cluster. Then when you add machines they automatically get the appropriate settings.
For each network intent (group of traffic types), select at least one unused network adapter (but probably at least two matching adapters for redundancy).

Resume deployment
If your deployment fails, you can resume the deployment. In your Azure Local instance, go toDeploymentsand in the right-pane, selectResume deployment.

Post deployment tasks
After the deployment is complete, you might need to perform some more tasks to secure your system and ensure it's ready for workloads.
Enable Health monitoring
To monitor storage pool consumption, use the steps inEnable health alertsto receive alerts in Azure portal. An alert is created when the storage pool reaches 70%.
Enable RDP
For security reasons, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is disabled and the local administrator renamed after the deployment completes on Azure Local instances. For more information on the renamed administrator, go toLocal builtin user accounts.
You might need to connect to the system via RDP to deploy workloads. Follow these steps to connect to your system via the Remote PowerShell and then enable RDP:
