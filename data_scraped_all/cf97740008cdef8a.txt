This article is part of the guideMonitor virtual machines and their workloads in Azure Monitor. It describes how to configure collection of data after you deploy Azure Monitor Agent to your Azure and hybrid virtual machines in Azure Monitor.
This article provides guidance on collecting the most common types of telemetry from virtual machines. The exact configuration that you choose depends on the workloads that you run on your machines. Included in each section are sample log search alerts that you can use with that data.
For more information about analyzing telemetry collected from your virtual machines, seeMonitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Analyze monitoring data.
For more information about using telemetry collected from your virtual machines to create alerts in Azure Monitor, seeMonitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Alerts.
Note
This scenario describes how to implement complete monitoring of your Azure and hybrid virtual machine environment. To get started monitoring your first Azure virtual machine, seeMonitor Azure virtual machines.
Data collection rules
Data collection from Azure Monitor Agent is defined by one or moredata collection rules (DCRs)that are stored in your Azure subscription and associated with your virtual machines.
For virtual machines, DCRs define data such as events and performance counters to collect and specify the Log Analytics workspaces where data should be sent. The DCR can also usetransformationsto filter out unwanted data and to add calculated columns. A single machine can be associated with multiple DCRs, and a single DCR can be associated with multiple machines. DCRs are delivered to any machines they're associated with where Azure Monitor Agent processes them.
View data collection rules
You can view the DCRs in your Azure subscription fromData Collection Ruleson theMonitormenu in the Azure portal. DCRs support other data collection scenarios in Azure Monitor, so all of your DCRs aren't necessarily for virtual machines.

Create data collection rules
There are multiple methods to create DCRs depending on the data collection scenario. In some cases, the Azure portal walks you through the configuration. Other scenarios require you to edit a DCR directly. When you configure VM insights, it creates a preconfigured DCR for you automatically. The following sections identify common data to collect and how to configure data collection.
In some cases, you might need toedit an existing DCRto add functionality. For example, you might use the Azure portal to create a DCR that collects Windows or Syslog events. You then want to add a transformation to that DCR to filter out columns in the events that you don't want to collect.
As your environment matures and grows in complexity, you should implement a strategy for organizing your DCRs to help their management. For guidance on different strategies, seeBest practices for data collection rule creation and management in Azure Monitor.
Control costs
Because your Azure Monitor cost is dependent on how much data you collect, ensure that you're not collecting more than you need to meet your monitoring requirements. Your configuration is a balance between your budget and how much insight you want into the operation of your virtual machines.
Tip
For strategies to reduce your Azure Monitor costs, seeCost optimization and Azure Monitor.
A typical virtual machine generates between 1 GB and 3 GB of data per month. This data size depends on the configuration of the machine, the workloads running on it, and the configuration of your DCRs. Before you configure data collection across your entire virtual machine environment, begin collection on some representative machines to better predict your expected costs when deployed across your environment. UseLog Analytics workspace insightsor log queries inData volume by computerto determine the amount of billable data collected for each machine and adjust accordingly.
Evaluate collected data and filter out any that meets the following criteria to reduce your costs. Each data source that you collect may have a different method for filtering out unwanted data. See the sections below for the details each of the common data sources.
Not used for alerting.
No known forensic or diagnostic value.
Not required by regulators.
Not used in any dashboards or workbooks.
You can also usetransformationsto implement more granular filtering and also to filter data from columns that provide little value. For example, you might have a Windows event that's valuable for alerting, but it includes columns with redundant or excessive data. You can create a transformation that allows the event to be collected but removes this excessive data.
Filter data as much as possible before it's sent to Azure Monitor to avoid apotential charge for filtering too much data using transformations. Usetransformationsfor record filtering using complex logic and for filtering columns with data that you don't require.
Default data collection
Azure Monitor automatically performs the following data collection without requiring any other configuration.
Platform metrics
Platform metrics for Azure virtual machines include important host metrics such as CPU, network, and disk utilization. They can be:
Viewed on theOverview page.
Analyzed withmetrics explorerfor the machine in the Azure portal.
Used formetric alerts.
Activity log
Theactivity logis collected automatically. It includes the recent activity of the machine, such as any configuration changes and when it was stopped and started. You can view the platform metrics and activity log collected for each virtual machine host in the Azure portal.
You canview the activity logfor an individual machine or for all resources in a subscription.Create a diagnostic settingto send this data into the same Log Analytics workspace used by Azure Monitor Agent to analyze it with the other monitoring data collected for the virtual machine. There's no cost for ingestion or retention of activity log data.
VM availability information in Azure Resource Graph
WithAzure Resource Graph, you can use the same Kusto Query Language used in log queries to query your Azure resources at scale with complex filtering, grouping, and sorting by resource properties. You can useVM health annotationsto Resource Graph for detailed failure attribution and downtime analysis.
For information on what data is collected and how to view it, seeMonitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Analyze monitoring data.
VM insights
When you enable VM insights, it creates a DCR with theMSVMI-prefix that collects the following information. You can use this same DCR with other machines as opposed to creating a new one for each VM.
Common performance counters for the client operating system are sent to theInsightsMetricstable in the Log Analytics workspace. Counter names are normalized to use the same common name regardless of the operating system type.

If you specified processes and dependencies to be collected, the following tables are populated:VMBoundPort: Traffic for open server ports on the machineVMComputer: Inventory data for the machineVMConnection: Traffic for inbound and outbound connections to and from the machineVMProcess: Processes running on the machine
If you specified processes and dependencies to be collected, the following tables are populated:
VMBoundPort: Traffic for open server ports on the machine
VMComputer: Inventory data for the machine
VMConnection: Traffic for inbound and outbound connections to and from the machine
VMProcess: Processes running on the machine
By default,VM insightswon't enable collection of processes and dependencies to save data ingestion costs. This data is required for the Map feature and also deploys the dependency agent to the machine.Enable this collectionif you want to use this feature.
Collect Windows and Syslog events
The operating system and applications in virtual machines often write to the Windows event log or Syslog. You might create an alert as soon as a single event is found or wait for a series of matching events within a particular time window. You might also collect events for later analysis, such as identifying particular trends over time, or for performing troubleshooting after a problem occurs.
For guidance on how to create a DCR to collect Windows and Syslog events, seeCollect data with Azure Monitor Agent. You can quickly create a DCR by using the most common Windows event logs and Syslog facilities filtering by event level.
For more granular filtering by criteria such as event ID, you can create a custom filter by usingXPath queries. You can further filter the collected data byediting the DCRto add atransformation.
Use the following guidance as a recommended starting point for event collection. Modify the DCR settings to filter unneeded events and add other events depending on your requirements.
Sample log queries: Windows events
Event
Event \| where EventLevelName == "Error"
Event \| summarize count() by Source
Event \| where EventLevelName == "Error" \| summarize count() by Source
Sample log queries: Syslog events
Syslog
Syslog \| where SeverityLevel == "error"
Syslog \| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Computer
Syslog \| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Facility
Collect performance counters
Performance data from the client can be sent to eitherAzure Monitor MetricsorAzure Monitor Logs, and you typically send them to both destinations. If you enabled VM insights, a common set of performance counters is collected in Logs to support its performance charts. You can't modify this set of counters, but you can create other DCRs to collect more counters and send them to different destinations.
There are multiple reasons why you would want to create a DCR to collect guest performance:
You aren't using VM insights, so client performance data isn't already being collected.
Collect other performance counters that VM insights isn't collecting.
Collect performance counters from other workloads running on your client.
Send performance data toAzure Monitor Metricswhere you can use them with metrics explorer and metrics alerts.
For guidance on creating a DCR to collect performance counters, seeCollect events and performance counters from virtual machines with Azure Monitor Agent. You can quickly create a DCR by using the most common counters. For more granular filtering by criteria such as event ID, you can create a custom filter by usingXPath queries.
Note
You might choose to combine performance and event collection in the same DCR.
Sample log queries
The following samples use thePerftable with custom performance data.
Perf
Perf
Perf \| where Computer == "MyComputer"
Perf \| where CounterName == "Current Disk Queue Length"
Perf \| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total" \| summarize AVGCPU = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
Perf \| where CounterName == "% Processor Time" \| summarize AggregatedValue = max(CounterValue) by Computer
Perf \| where ObjectName == "LogicalDisk" and CounterName == "Current Disk Queue Length" and Computer == "MyComputerName" \| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by InstanceName
Perf \| where CounterName == "Disk Transfers/sec" \| summarize AggregatedValue = percentile(CounterValue, 95) by Computer
Perf \| where CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total" \| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), Computer
Perf \| where Computer == "MyComputer" and CounterName startswith_cs "%" and InstanceName == "_Total" \| summarize AggregatedValue = percentile(CounterValue, 70) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), CounterName
Perf \| where CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total" and Computer == "MyComputer" \| summarize ["min(CounterValue)"] = min(CounterValue), ["avg(CounterValue)"] = avg(CounterValue), ["percentile75(CounterValue)"] = percentile(CounterValue, 75), ["max(CounterValue)"] = max(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), Computer
Perf \| where ObjectName == "MSSQL$INST2:Databases" and InstanceName == "master"
Perf \| where TimeGenerated >ago(5m) \| where ObjectName == "Process" and InstanceName != "_Total" and InstanceName != "Idle" \| where CounterName == "% Processor Time" \| summarize cpuVal=avg(CounterValue) by Computer,InstanceName \| join (Perf\| where TimeGenerated >ago(5m) \| where ObjectName == "Process" and CounterName == "ID Process" \| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by ProcID=CounterValue ) on Computer,InstanceName \| sort by TimeGenerated desc \| summarize AvgCPU = avg(cpuVal) by InstanceName,ProcID
Collect text logs
Some applications write events written to a text log stored on the virtual machine. Create acustom table and DCRto collect this data. You define the location of the text log, its detailed configuration, and the schema of the custom table. There's a cost for the ingestion and retention of this data in the workspace.
Sample log queries
The column names used here are examples only. The column names for your log will most likely be different.
MyApp_CL \| summarize count() by code
MyApp_CL \| where status == "Error" \| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 15m)
Collect IIS logs
IIS running on Windows machines writes logs to a text file. Configure IIS log collection by usingCollect IIS logs with Azure Monitor Agent. There's a cost for the ingestion and retention of this data in the workspace.
Records from the IIS log are stored in theW3CIISLogtable in the Log Analytics workspace. There's a cost for the ingestion and retention of this data in the workspace.
Sample log queries
W3CIISLog \| where csHost=="www.contoso.com" \| summarize count() by csUriStem
W3CIISLog \| summarize sum(csBytes) by Computer
Monitor a service or daemon
To monitor the status of a Windows service or Linux daemon, enable theChange Tracking and Inventorysolution inAzure Automation.
Azure Monitor has no ability on its own to monitor the status of a service or daemon. There are some possible methods to use, such as looking for events in the Windows event log, but this method is unreliable. You can also look for the process associated with the service running on the machine from theVMProcesstable populated by VM insights. This table only updates every hour, which isn't typically sufficient if you want to use this data for alerting.
Note
The Change Tracking and Analysis solution is different from theChange Analysisfeature in VM insights. This feature is in public preview and not yet included in this scenario.
For different options to enable the Change Tracking solution on your virtual machines, seeEnable Change Tracking and Inventory. This solution includes methods to configure virtual machines at scale. You have tocreate an Azure Automation accountto support the solution.
When you enable Change Tracking and Inventory, two new tables are created in your Log Analytics workspace. Use these tables for logs queries and log search alert rules.
Sample log queries

Monitor a port
Port monitoring verifies that a machine is listening on a particular port. Two potential strategies for port monitoring are described here.
Dependency agent tables
If you're using VM insights withProcesses and dependencies collectionenabled, you can useVMConnectionandVMBoundPortto analyze connections and ports on the machine. TheVMBoundPorttable is updated every minute with each process running on the computer and the port it's listening on. You can create a log search alert similar to the missing heartbeat alert to find processes that have stopped or to alert when the machine isn't listening on a particular port.
VMBoundPort
Review the count of ports open on your VMs to assess which VMs have configuration and security vulnerabilities.VMBoundPort
| where Ip != "127.0.0.1"
| summarize by Computer, Machine, Port, Protocol
| summarize OpenPorts=count() by Computer, Machine

| render timechart
Connection Manager
TheConnection Monitorfeature ofNetwork Watcheris used to test connections to a port on a virtual machine. A test verifies that the machine is listening on the port and that it's accessible on the network.
Connection Manager requires the Network Watcher extension on the client machine initiating the test. It doesn't need to be installed on the machine being tested. For more information, seeTutorial: Monitor network communication using the Azure portal.
There's an extra cost for Connection Manager. For more information, seeNetwork Watcher pricing.
Run a process on a local machine
Monitoring of some workloads requires a local process. An example is a PowerShell script that runs on the local machine to connect to an application and collect or process data. You can useHybrid Runbook Worker, which is part ofAzure Automation, to run a local PowerShell script. There's no direct charge for Hybrid Runbook Worker, but there's a cost for each runbook that it uses.
The runbook can access any resources on the local machine to gather required data. It can't send data directly to Azure Monitor or create an alert. To create an alert, have the runbook write an entry to a custom log. Then configure that log to be collected by Azure Monitor. Create a log search alert rule that fires on that log entry.
