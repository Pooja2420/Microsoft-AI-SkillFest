Workbooks are found in Microsoft Entra ID and in Azure Monitor. The concepts, processes, and best practices are the same for both types of workbooks, however, workbooks for Microsoft Entra ID cover only those identity management scenarios that are associated with Microsoft Entra ID.
When using workbooks, you can either start with an empty workbook, or use an existing template. Workbook templates enable you to quickly get started using workbooks without needing to build from scratch.
Public templatespublished to agalleryare a good starting point when you're just getting started with workbooks.
Private templatesare helpful when you start building your own workbooks and want to save one as a template to serve as the foundation for multiple workbooks in your tenant.
