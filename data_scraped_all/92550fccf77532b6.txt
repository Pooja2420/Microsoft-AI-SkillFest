Azure Pipelines security controls access to pipelines and their resources through a hierarchy of security groups and users. This system governs resources like release pipelines, task groups, agent pools, and service connections, though external to pipelines. Upon creation, pipelines and resources inherit project-level permissions from predefined security groups and users, affecting all project pipelines.
Administrators typically have unrestricted access, contributors oversee resources, and readers have view-only permissions, with user roles determining group assignments. For more information, seeAbout pipeline security roles.
Prerequisites

Set pipeline permissions in Azure Pipelines
Pipeline security follows a hierarchical model of user and group permissions. Project-level permissions are inherited at the object level by all pipelines in the project. You can change inherited and default user and group permissions for all pipelines at the project- and object-levels. You can't change the permissions set by the system.
The following table shows the default security groups for pipelines:
The system automatically creates the<project name> Build Service (collection name)user, a member of theProject Collection Build Service Accountsgroup. This user executes build services within the project.
Depending on the resources you use in your pipelines, your pipeline could include other built-in users. For instance, if you're using a GitHub repository for your source code, a GitHub user is included.
The following table shows default permissions for security groups:
For a description of pipeline permissions, seePipeline or Build permissions.

Set deployment group security in Azure Pipelines
A deployment group is a pool of physical or virtual target machines that have agents installed. Deployment groups are only available with classic release pipelines. You can create deployment groups in the following circumstances:
When dependent deployment groups are provisioned for projects from organization deployment pools
When a deployment group is created at the project level
When a project shares a deployment group, dependent deployment groups are created in the recipient projects
Individual deployment groups inherit the security roles from the project-level assignments. You can override the project-level assignments for a user or group. To remove an inherited user or group, or lower the privilege level of an inherited role, you mustdisable inheritance.
When a deployment group gets shared with another project, a separate deployment group, which inherits its security roles, is created in the other project. If sharing is disabled, the deployment group is removed from the other project.
The following table shows security roles for deployment groups:

Set security for environments in Azure Pipelines
Environments bundle deployment targets for YAML pipelines but aren't compatible with classic pipelines. All environments inherit, security roles, assigned at the project level to default users and groups. You can customize these settings for individual environments, including removing inherited users or groups and adjusting privilege levels, by disabling inheritance. Additionally, you can manage pipeline access for each environment.

Set library security in Azure Pipelines
The library facilitates asset sharing, like variable groups and secure files, across build and release pipelines. It employs a unified security model, allowing role assignments for asset management, creation, and usage. These roles, once set at the library level, automatically apply to all contained assets but can be individually adjusted.
The following table shows default roles:
For individual library assets, the creator is automatically assigned theAdministratorrole.

Set service connection project permissions
You can share a service connection across multiple projects. Project permissions control which projects can use the service connection. By default, service connections aren't shared with any other projects.
Only the organization-level administrators from user permissions can share the service connection with other projects.
The user who's sharing the service connection with a project must have at least Create service connection permission in the target project.
The user who shares the service connection with a project becomes the project-level Administrator for that service connection. The project-level inheritance is set to on in the target project.
The service connection name is appended with the project name and it can be renamed in the target project scope.
Organization-level administrator can unshare a service connection from any shared project.
Access is restricted to the current project by default. To grant access to other projects in the organization or collection, selectAdd projects.

Set task group permissions in Azure Pipelines

Set agent pool security in Azure Pipelines
Agent pools are a collection of agents that you use to run build and release jobs.
You can create agent pools with either organization scope or project scope. Organization-scoped agent pools are accessible to all existing or new projects in the organization, and by default, each organization has two agent pools:Azure PipelinesandDefault. These default pools are accessible by all projects in the organization.
Project-scoped agent pools are created at the project level and are accessible only to that project.
From the organization settings, you can manage the organization-level security settings for all agent pools in the organization, and for individual agent pools. Both organization- and project-level security roles can be managed from the project settings.
