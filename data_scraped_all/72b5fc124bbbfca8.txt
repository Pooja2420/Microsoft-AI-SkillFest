Boot diagnostics is a debugging feature for Azure virtual machines (VM) that allows diagnosis of VM boot failures. Boot diagnostics enables a user to observe the state of their VM as it is booting up by collecting serial log information and screenshots.
Boot diagnostics storage account
When you create a VM in Azure portal, boot diagnostics is enabled by default. The recommended boot diagnostics experience is to use a managed storage account, as it yields significant performance improvements in the time to create an Azure VM. An Azure managed storage account is used, removing the time it takes to create a user storage account to store the boot diagnostics data.
Important
The boot diagnostics data blobs (which comprise of logs and snapshot images) are stored in a managed storage account. Customers will be charged only on used GiBs by the blobs, not on the disk's provisioned size. The snapshot meters will be used for billing of the managed storage account. Because the managed accounts are created on either Standard LRS or Standard ZRS, customers will be charged at $0.05/GB per month for the size of their diagnostic data blobs only. For more information on this pricing, seeManaged disks pricing. Customers see this charge tied to their VM resource URI.
An alternative boot diagnostic experience is to use a custom storage account. A user can either create a new storage account or use an existing one. When the storage firewall is enabled on the custom storage account (Enabled from all networksoption isn't selected), you must:
Make sure that access through the storage firewall is allowed for the Azure platform to publish the screenshot and serial log. To do this, go to the custom boot diagnostics storage account in the Azure portal and then selectNetworkingfrom theSecurity + networkingsection. Check if theAllow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage accountcheckbox is selected.

Allow storage firewall for users to view the boot screenshots or serial logs. To do this, add your network or the client/browser's Internet IPs as firewall exclusions. For more information, seeConfigure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks.

To configure the storage firewall for Azure Serial Console, seeUse Serial Console with custom boot diagnostics storage account firewall enabled.
Note
The custom storage account associated with boot diagnostics requires the storage account and the associated virtual machines reside in the same region and subscription.
Boot diagnostics view
Go to the virtual machine blade in the Azure portal, the boot diagnostics option is under theHelpsection in the Azure portal. Selecting boot diagnostics display a screenshot and serial log information. The serial log contains kernel messaging and the screenshot is a snapshot of your VMs current state. Based on if the VM is running Windows or Linux determines what the expected screenshot would look like. For Windows, users see a desktop background and for Linux, users see a login prompt.

Enable managed boot diagnostics
Managed boot diagnostics can be enabled through the Azure portal, CLI and ARM Templates.
Enable managed boot diagnostics using the Azure portal
When you create a VM in the Azure portal, the default setting is to have boot diagnostics enabled using a managed storage account. Navigate to theManagementtab during the VM creation to view it.

Enable managed boot diagnostics using CLI
Boot diagnostics with a managed storage account is supported in Azure CLI 2.12.0 and later. If you don't input a name or URI for a storage account, a managed account is used. For more information and code samples, see theCLI documentation for boot diagnostics.
Enable managed boot diagnostics using PowerShell
Boot diagnostics with a managed storage account is supported in Azure PowerShell 6.6.0 and later. If you don't input a name or URI for a storage account, a managed account is used. For more information and code samples, see thePowerShell documentation for boot diagnostics.
Enable managed boot diagnostics using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
Everything after API version 2020-06-01 supports managed boot diagnostics. For more information, seeboot diagnostics instance view.

Note
Replace publisherName, imageOffer, imageSKU and imageVersion accordingly.
Limitations
Managed boot diagnostics is only available for Azure Resource Manager VMs.
Managed boot diagnostics doesn't support VMs using unmanaged OS disks.
Boot diagnostics doesn't support premium storage accounts or zone redundant storage accounts. If either of these are used for boot diagnostics users receive anStorageAccountTypeNotSupportederror when starting the VM.
StorageAccountTypeNotSupported
Managed storage accounts are supported in Resource Manager API version "2020-06-01" and later.
Portal only supports the use of boot diagnostics with a managed storage account for single instance VMs.
Users can't configure a retention period for Managed Boot Diagnostics. The logs are overwritten when the total size crosses 1 GB.
