Remarks
Use this task in a release pipeline to pause an active deployment within a stage. This is typically executed to perform various manual steps or actions and then the automated deployment tasks are resumed.
Note
This task can only be used in anagentless joband is intended for use in a classic release pipeline. This article refers to classic pipelines. For YAML usage, seeManual Validation task.

TheManual Interventiontask does not perform deployment actions directly. Instead, it allows you to pause an active deployment within a stage, typically to perform various manual steps or actions, and then the automated deployment tasks are resumed. For example, the user may
need to edit the details of the current release before continuing (perhaps by entering the values for custom variables used by the tasks in the release).
TheManual Interventiontask configuration includes anInstructionsparameter that is used to provide related information or to specify the manual steps the user executes during the agentless job. You can configure the task to send email notifications to users and user groups when it is awaiting intervention and specify the automatic response (reject or resume the deployment) after a configurable timeout occurs.
Note
You can use built-in and custom variables to generate portions of your instructions.
When the Manual Intervention task is activated during a deployment, it sets the deployment state toIN PROGRESS. A message bar is displayed with a link that opens the Manual Intervention dialog, which contains the instructions. After carrying out the manual steps, the administrator or user can choose to resume the deployment or reject it. Users withManage deploymentpermission on the stage can resume or reject the manual intervention.
