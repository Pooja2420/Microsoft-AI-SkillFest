What is the Microsoft healthcare agent service?
The Healthcare agent service is a  cloud platform designed to empower developers within healthcare organizations to build and deploy compliant Generative AI healthcare copilots. These advanced tools help streamline processes, enhance patient experiences, and reduce operational costs. By using Generative AI, healthcare organizations can create intelligent solutions that serve as copilots for healthcare professionals, enabling them to effectively manage administrative workloads and improve service delivery.
Infused with Generative AI capabilities, the service features ahealthcare-adapted orchestratorpowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This orchestrator can seamlesslyintegrate with customer-defined sources, OpenAI Plugins, and built-in Healthcare Intelligence sources. Organizations can ground generative answers in their own data, utilizing the Azure AI Search service for vectorized document searches or Bing Custom Search to query specific customer websites.
To ensure thereliability of generated responses, all outputs are checked throughcomprehensive Healthcare Safeguards. These safeguards include evidence detection, provenance tracking, and clinical code validation, ensuring thatevery AI-generated answer meets high standards of accuracy and reliability. Moreover, the service incorporatesChat Safeguards, which provide aclear disclaimer, evidence attribution, feedback mechanisms, and abuse monitoring, enhancing transparency and user trust.
The Healthcare agent service is ideally suited for developers in IT departments across various healthcare sectors, including providers, pharmaceutical companies, telemedicine providers, and health insurers. By creating a tailored "healthcare agent service instance," organizations can easily integrate these intelligent tools into existing systems, benefiting patients, nurses, doctors, and other stakeholders.
Building an instance allows you to:
Enhance patient and clinician experiences
Streamline processes and improve operational efficiency
Deliver superior services and outcomes
Reduce costs while maintaining high-quality care
Why use the Microsoft healthcare agent service?
The healthcare agent service simplifies the process of creating a healthcare copilot that address the compliance and regulatory requirements of the healthcare industry.
It does so by providing:
An extensible management portal
Healthcare adapted safeguards
Built in healthcare sources that can be used with Generative AI
A built-in healthcare adapted orchestrator.
Healthcare-specific configuration options
Built in triage and symptom checker
Integration with Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) and other cognitive services.
Users interact with the service via text or voice in a self-service manner.
Use cases
Our customers are using the healthcare agent service to build healthcare copilots that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example:
PharmaceuticalCompanies are using AI to enhance clinician workflows. They're using AI-powered copilot experiences that provide clinicians with a conversational interface tonavigate complex clinical documentation and access relevant informationmore naturally, ensuring clinicians havequick, intuitive access to medical knowledge. These solutions, compliant with security standards, are being tailored tomeet regional market needs.

Configurable and extensible
The healthcare agent service provides flexibility of use to customers and customers:
Unique scenarios can be authored by customers for their healthcare agent service instances to extend the baseline scenarios and support their own flows.
The healthcare agent service instance's behavior can be configured to match customer use cases, processes, and scenarios through features like "Generative Answers on Customer Sources" and "Healthcare Intelligence."
The healthcare agent service instance can easily be connected to customers' information systemsâsuch as systems that manage EMR, health information, and customer informationâby utilizing Azure OpenAI Data Connections and Customer Source Data Connections.
The healthcare agent service instance can be easily integrated into other systems such as websites, chat channels, and digital personal assistants by using the Healthcare Orchestrator and scenario editor functionalities.
Security and privacy
The information handled by each instance of the healthcare agent service is
privacy protected toHIPAAstandards and secured to the highest standards for privacy and security
by Microsoft. Built on top of the industry-leadingMicrosoft
Azuretechnology, the Azure
architecture powers the healthcare agent service's ability to scale with
resilience, while maintaining the highest standards ofprivacy and
security.
Easy to manage
Each healthcare agent service instance is easily managed and monitored by Microsoft partners via the healthcare agent service's management portal and management API. The management portal provides the ability to define the healthcare agent service instance's behavior in fine detail and monitor usage with built-in reports. The management API allows the partner to embed the healthcare agent service instance and securely exchange data and information.
Common scenarios
The healthcare agent service contains several built-in scenarios, a scenario editor and a healthcare adapted orchestrator
Some common scenarios are:
Healthcare Plugin Integration: Customers can utilize the orchestrator to connect one or more healthcare plugins, such as the Healthcare Intelligence plugin, Generative Answers on Customer Sources plugin, or their own OpenAPI plugin. This allows the Generative AI model to determine which plugin to trigger, providing relevant answers based on end-user questions. With the orchestrator, customers can use the intelligence of Generative AI to find the most relevant plugin without needing to create a complex decision tree, all protected by the healthcare safeguards

Scalable Platform
The healthcare agent service is a cloud platform for developers, built on top ofMicrosoft Azure. This multitenant service provides unique healthcare agent service instances for Microsoft partners. The management portal gives each partner detailed control over configuration and extensibility. Authored scenarios are unique to the partner's healthcare agent service instance. The healthcare agent service instance can be embedded within the partner's digital experience.
Healthcare agent service useBot Frameworkunder the hood as a messaging and routing platform to deliver messages to and from the end user. The conversational intelligence and medical knowledge is provided by the healthcare agent service in two ways:
Integrated third-party content - Microsoft partners with trusted content providers to deliver extensive and credible sources of medical knowledge.
Custom conversational scenarios developed with ourvisual designer toolto accommodate his most complex and intricate needs. The author can call backend resources using secure and standard authorization and authentication methods.
Partners can integrate the open sourceWeb-Chatclient into their native or web applications.
Encryption
There are many controls in place to protect customer data transmitted and stored within the healthcare agent service. Encryption is an important component in a multi-layered defense-in-depth data protection strategy to safeguard customer data in the healthcare agent service and ensure the service meets your organizationâs security and compliance needs.
Customer data stored by the healthcare agent service uses Azure storage and Azure Cosmos DBs under the hood. Healthcare agent service only use persistent storage services that are always encrypted at rest. Encryption keys are managed by Microsoft and rotated periodically to prevent exposure. More over the healthcare agent service only allows incoming and outgoing data connections over HTTPS ensuring the data in transit is also always encrypted.
