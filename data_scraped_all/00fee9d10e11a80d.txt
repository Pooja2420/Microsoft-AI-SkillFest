This tutorial shows you how to discover, assess, and migrate Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machines (VMs) to Azure VMs by using the Azure Migrate: Server Assessment and Migration and modernization tools.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Verify prerequisites for migration.
Prepare Azure resources with the Migration and modernization tool. Set up permissions for your Azure account and resources to work with Azure Migrate and Modernize.
Prepare GCP VM instances for migration.
Add the Migration and modernization tool in the Azure Migrate and Modernize hub.
Set up the replication appliance and deploy the configuration server.
Install the Mobility service on GCP VMs you want to migrate.
Enable replication for VMs.
Track and monitor the replication status.
Run a test migration to make sure everything's working as expected.
Run a full migration to Azure.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Discover and assess
Before you migrate to Azure, we recommend that you perform a VM discovery and migration assessment. This assessment helps right-size your GCP VMs for migration to Azure and estimate potential Azure run costs.
To set up an assessment:
Follow thetutorialto set up Azure and prepare your GCP VMs for an assessment. Note that:Azure Migrate and Modernize uses password authentication to discover GCP VM instances. GCP instances don't support password authentication by default. Before you can discover an instance, you need to enable password authentication.For Windows machines, allow WinRM port 5985 (HTTP). This port allows remote WMI calls.For Linux machines:Sign in to each Linux machine.Open thesshd_configfile:vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.In the file, locate thePasswordAuthenticationline and change the value toyes.Save the file and close it. Restart the ssh service.If you're using a root user to discover your Linux VMs, ensure that root login is allowed on the VMs.Sign in to each Linux machine.Open thesshd_configfile:vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.In the file, locate thePermitRootLoginline and change the value toyes.Save the file and close it. Restart the ssh service.

Then, follow thistutorialto set up an Azure Migrate project and appliance to discover and assess your GCP VMs.
Although we recommend that you try out an assessment, performing an assessment isn't a mandatory step to be able to migrate VMs.
Prerequisites
Ensure that the GCP VMs you want to migrate are running a supported operating system (OS) version. GCP VMs are treated like physical machines for the migration. Review thesupported operating systems and kernel versionsfor the physical server migration workflow. You can use standard commands likehostnamectloruname -ato check the OS and kernel versions for your Linux VMs. We recommend that you perform a test migration to validate if the VM works as expected before you proceed with the actual migration.
hostnamectl
uname -a
Make sure your GCP VMs comply with thesupported configurationsfor migration to Azure.
Verify that the GCP VMs that you replicate to Azure comply withAzure VM requirements.
Some changes are needed on the VMs before you migrate them to Azure:For some operating systems, Azure Migrate and Modernize makes these changes automatically.Make these changes before you begin migration. If you migrate the VM before you make the change, the VM might not boot up in Azure.
ReviewWindowsandLinuxchanges you need to make.

Prepare Azure resources for migration
Prepare Azure for migration with the Migration and modernization tool.
Assign permissions to create a project
In the Azure portal, open the subscription and selectAccess control (IAM).
InCheck access, find the relevant account and select it to view permissions.
You should haveContributororOwnerpermissions.If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
Assign Azure account permissions
Assign the VM Contributor role to the Azure account. This role provides permissions to:
Create a VM in the selected resource group.
Create a VM in the selected virtual network.
Write to an Azure managed disk.
Create an Azure network
Set upan Azure virtual network. When you replicate to Azure, the Azure VMs that are created are joined to the Azure virtual network that you specified when you set up migration.
Prepare GCP instances for migration
To prepare for GCP to Azure migration, you need to prepare and deploy a replication appliance for migration.
Prepare a machine for the replication appliance
The Migration and modernization tool uses a replication appliance to replicate machines to Azure. The replication appliance runs the following components:
Configuration server: The configuration server coordinates communications between the GCP VMs and Azure and manages data replication.
Process server: The process server acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data and optimizes that data with caching, compression, and encryption. Then it sends the data to a cache storage account in Azure.
To prepare for appliance deployment:
Set up a separate GCP VM to host the replication appliance. This instance must be running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016.Reviewthe hardware, software, and networking requirements for the appliance.

The appliance shouldn't be installed on a source VM that you want to replicate or on the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment appliance you might have installed before. It should be deployed on a different VM.
The appliance shouldn't be installed on a source VM that you want to replicate or on the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment appliance you might have installed before. It should be deployed on a different VM.
The source GCP VMs to be migrated should have a network line of sight to the replication appliance. Configure necessary firewall rules to enable this capability. We recommend that you deploy the replication appliance in the same virtual private cloud (VPC) network as the source VMs to be migrated. If the replication appliance needs to be in a different VPC, the VPCs must be connected through VPC peering.

If the replication appliance needs to be in a different VPC, the VPCs must be connected through VPC peering.
The source GCP VMs communicate with the replication appliance on ports HTTPS 443 (control channel orchestration) and TCP 9443 (data transport) inbound for replication management and replication data transfer. The replication appliance in turn orchestrates and sends replication data to Azure over port HTTPS 443 outbound. To configure these rules, edit the security group inbound/outbound rules with the appropriate ports and source IP information.

Install the Mobility service agent
A Mobility service agent must be preinstalled on the source GCP VMs to be migrated before you can initiate replication. The approach you choose to install the Mobility service agent might depend on your organization's preferences and existing tools. The "push" installation method built into Azure Site Recovery isn't currently supported. Approaches you might want to consider:
System Center Configuration Manager
Azure Arc for servers and custom script extensions
Install Mobility agent for Windows
Install Mobility agent for Linux
Extract the contents of the installer tarball to a local folder (for example, /tmp/MobSvcInstaller) on the GCP VM, as follows:mkdir /tmp/MobSvcInstaller
tar -C /tmp/MobSvcInstaller -xvf <Installer tarball>
cd /tmp/MobSvcInstaller
Extract the contents of the installer tarball to a local folder (for example, /tmp/MobSvcInstaller) on the GCP VM, as follows:

Note
You can update replication settings any time before replication starts by selectingManage>Replicating machines. Settings can't be changed after replication starts.
Track and monitor replication status
When you selectReplicate, a Start Replication job begins.
When the Start Replication job finishes successfully, the VMs begin their initial replication to Azure.
After initial replication finishes, delta replication begins. Incremental changes to GCP VM disks are periodically replicated to the replica disks in Azure.
You can track job status in the portal notifications.
You can monitor replication status by selectingReplicating serversinMigration and modernization.

Run a test migration
When delta replication begins, you can run a test migration for the VMs before you run a full migration to Azure. We highly recommend the test migration. It provides an opportunity to discover any potential issues and fix them before you proceed with the actual migration. We recommend that you do this step at least once for each VM before you migrate it.
Running a test migration checks that migration works as expected, without affecting the GCP VMs, which remain operational and continue replicating.
Test migration simulates the migration by creating an Azure VM using replicated data. (The test usually migrates to a nonproduction virtual network in your Azure subscription.)
You can use the replicated test Azure VM to validate the migration, perform app testing, and address any issues before full migration.
To do a test migration:
InMigration goals, selectServers, databases, and web apps>Migration and modernization>Test migrated servers.

Troubleshooting and tips
Question:I can't see my GCP VM in the discovered list of servers for migration.Answer:Check if your replication appliance meets the requirements. Make sure Mobility Agent is installed on the source VM to be migrated and is registered to the Configuration Server. Check the firewall rules to enable a network path between the replication appliance and source GCP VMs.
Question:How do I know if my VM was successfully migrated?Answer:Post migration, you can view and manage the VM from theVirtual Machinespage. Connect to the migrated VM to validate.
Question:I'm unable to import VMs for migration from my previously created Server Assessment results.Answer:Currently, we don't support the import of assessment for this workflow. As a workaround, you can export the assessment and then manually select the VM recommendation during the Enable Replication step.
Question:I'm getting the error "Failed to fetch BIOS GUID" when I try to discover my GCP VMs.Answer:Use root login for authentication and not any pseudo user. If you aren't able to use a root user, ensure that the required capabilities are set on the user, according to the instructions provided in thesupport matrix. Also review supported operating systems for GCP VMs.
Question:My replication status isn't progressing.Answer:Check if your replication appliance meets the requirements.
