Microsoft Entra IDandAzure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)let you control authorization checks on your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure RBAC with your cluster gives you the benefits of Azure role assignments, such as activity logs showing changes made by users to your Azure resource.
Architecture

In order to route all authorization access checks to the authorization service in Azure, a webhook server (guard) is deployed on the cluster.
Theapiserverof the cluster is configured to usewebhook token authenticationandwebhook authorizationso thatTokenAccessReviewandSubjectAccessReviewrequests are routed to the guard webhook server. TheTokenAccessReviewandSubjectAccessReviewrequests are triggered by requests for Kubernetes resources sent to theapiserver.

Guard then makes acheckAccesscall on the authorization service in Azure to see if the requesting Microsoft Entra entity has access to the resource of concern.
checkAccess
If that entity has a role that permits this access, anallowedresponse is sent from the authorization service to guard. Guard, in turn, sends anallowedresponse to theapiserver, enabling the calling entity to access the requested Kubernetes resource.

If the entity doesn't have a role that permits this access, adeniedresponse is sent from the authorization service to guard. Guard sends adeniedresponse to theapiserver, giving the calling entity a 403 forbidden error on the requested resource.
