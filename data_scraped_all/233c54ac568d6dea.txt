The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources. In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources using Azure portal. The policy is assigned to a resource group and audits virtual machines that don't use managed disks. After you create the policy assignment, you identify non-compliant virtual machines.
When assigning a built-in policy or initiative definition, it's optional to reference a version. Policy assignments of built-in definitions default to the latest version and automatically inherit minor version changes unless otherwise specified.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure account, create afree accountbefore you begin.
A resource group with at least one virtual machine that doesn't use managed disks.
Create a policy assignment
In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment with a built-in policy definition,Audit VMs that do not use managed disks.

Identify non-compliant resources
On thePolicypane, selectComplianceand locate theAudit VMs that do not use managed diskspolicy assignment. The compliance state for a new policy assignment takes a few minutes to become active and provide results about the policy's state.

The policy assignment shows resources that aren't compliant with aCompliance stateofNon-compliant. To get more details, select the policy assignment name to view theResource Compliance.
When a condition is evaluated against your existing resources and found true, then those resources are marked as non-compliant with the policy. The following table shows how different policy effects work with the condition evaluation for the resulting compliance state. Although you don't see the evaluation logic in the Azure portal, the compliance state results are shown. The compliance state result is either compliant or non-compliant.
TheDeployIfNotExistandAuditIfNotExisteffects require theIFstatement to beTRUEand the existence condition to beFALSEto be non-compliant. WhenTRUE, theIFcondition triggers evaluation of the existence condition for the related resources.

In this quickstart, you assigned a policy definition to identify non-compliant resources in your Azure environment.
