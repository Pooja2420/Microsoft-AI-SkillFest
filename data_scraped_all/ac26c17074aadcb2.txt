Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured object data. You can use Blob Storage to gather or expose media, content, or application data to users. Because all blob data is stored within containers, you must create a storage container before you can begin to upload data. To learn more about Blob Storage, read theIntroduction to Azure Blob storage.
In this how-to article, you learn how to work with container objects within the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
To access Azure Storage, you'll need an Azure subscription. If you don't already have a subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
All access to Azure Storage takes place through a storage account. For this how-to article, create a storage account using theAzure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. For help with creating a storage account, seeCreate a storage account.
Create a container
A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.
To create a container in theAzure portal, follow these steps:
In the portal navigation pane on the left side of the screen, selectStorage accountsand choose a storage account. If the navigation pane isn't visible, select the menu button to toggle its visibility.

Within theContainerspane, select the+ Containerbutton to open theNew containerpane.
Within theContainerspane, select the+ Containerbutton to open theNew containerpane.
Within theNew Containerpane, provide aNamefor your new container. The container name must be lowercase, must start with a letter or number, and can include only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long. For more information about container and blob names, seeNaming and referencing containers, blobs, and metadata.

Read container properties and metadata
A container exposes both system properties and user-defined metadata. System properties exist on each Blob Storage resource. Some properties are read-only, while others can be read or set.
User-defined metadata consists of one or more name-value pairs that you specify for a Blob Storage resource. You can use metadata to store additional values with the resource. Metadata values are for your own purposes only, and don't affect how the resource behaves.
Container properties
To display the properties of a container within theAzure portal, follow these steps:
Navigate to the list of containers within your storage account.
Navigate to the list of containers within your storage account.
Select the checkbox next to the name of the container whose properties you want to view.

Read and write container metadata
Users that have large numbers of objects within their storage account can organize their data logically within containers using metadata.
To manage a container's metadata within theAzure portal, follow these steps:
Navigate to the list of containers in your storage account.

Manage container and blob access
Properly managing access to containers and their blobs is key to ensuring that your data remains safe. The following sections illustrate ways in which you can meet your access requirements.
Manage Azure RBAC role assignments for the container
Microsoft Entra ID offers optimum security for Blob Storage resources. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) determines what permissions a security principal has to a given resource. To grant access to a container, you'll assign an RBAC role at the container scope or above to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. You may also choose to add one or more conditions to the role assignment.
You can read about the assignment of roles atAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
Generate a shared access signature
A shared access signature (SAS) provides temporary, secure, delegated access to a client who wouldn't normally have permissions. A SAS gives you granular control over how a client can access your data. For example, you can specify which resources are available to the client. You can also limit the types of operations that the client can perform, and specify the duration.
Azure supports three types of SAS. Aservice SASprovides access to a resource in just one of the storage services: the Blob, Queue, Table, or File service. Anaccount SASis similar to a service SAS, but can permit access to resources in more than one storage service. Auser delegation SASis a SAS secured with Microsoft Entra credentials and can only be used with Blob Storage service.
When you create a SAS, you may set access limitations based on permission level, IP address or range, or start and expiry date and time. You can read more inGrant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures.
Caution
Any client that possesses a valid SAS can access data in your storage account as permitted by that SAS. It's important to protect a SAS from malicious or unintended use. Use discretion in distributing a SAS, and have a plan in place for revoking a compromised SAS.
To generate an SAS token using theAzure portal, follow these steps:
In the Azure portal, navigate to the list of containers in your storage account.

Note
The SAS token returned by the portal does not include the delimiter character ('?') for the URL query string. If you are appending the SAS token to a resource URL, remember to append the delimiter character to the resource URL before appending the SAS token.
Create a stored access or immutability policy
Astored access policygives you additional server-side control over one or more shared access signatures. When you associate an SAS with a stored access policy, the SAS inherits the restrictions defined in the policy. These extra restrictions allow you to change the start time, expiry time, or permissions for a signature. You can also revoke it after it has been issued.
Immutability policiescan be used to protect your data from overwrites and deletes. Immutability policies allow objects to be created and read, but prevents their modification or deletion for a specific duration. Blob Storage supports two types of immutability policies. Atime-based retention policyprohibits write and delete operations for a defined period of time. Alegal holdalso prohibits write and delete operations, but must be explicitly cleared before those operations can resume.
Configuring a stored access policy is a two-step process: the policy must first be defined, and then applied to the container afterward. To configure a stored access policy, follow these steps:
In the Azure portal, navigate to the list of containers in your storage account.

Manage leases
A container lease is used to establish or manage a lock for delete operations. When a lease is acquired within the Azure portal, the lock can only be created with an infinite duration. When created programmatically, the lock duration can range from 15 to 60 seconds, or it can be infinite.
There are five different lease operation modes, though only two are available within the Azure portal:
Acquire a lease
To acquire a lease using the Azure portal, follow these steps:
In the Azure portal, navigate to the list of containers in your storage account.
