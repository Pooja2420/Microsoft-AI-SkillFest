Configure continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) for your .NET core or ASP.NET application with DevOps Starter. DevOps Starter simplifies the initial configuration of a build and release pipeline in Azure Pipelines.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can get one free throughVisual Studio Dev Essentials.
Sign in to the Azure portal
DevOps Starter creates a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps. You can create a new Azure DevOps organization or use an  existing organization. DevOps Starter also creates Azure resources in the Azure subscription of your choice.

Commit code changes and execute CI/CD
DevOps Starter created a Git repository in Azure Repos or GitHub. To view the repository and make code changes to your application, do the following:
On the left of the DevOps Starter dashboard, select the link for yourmainbranch. This link opens a view to the newly created Git repository.

Examine the CI/CD pipeline
In the previous step, Azure DevOps Starter automatically configured a full CI/CD pipeline. Explore and customize the pipeline as needed. Take the following steps to familiarize yourself with the Azure DevOps build and release pipelines.
At the top of the DevOps Starter dashboard, selectBuild Pipelines. This link opens a browser tab and the Azure DevOps build pipeline for your new project.
