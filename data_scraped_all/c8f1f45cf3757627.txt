With Azure Logic Apps and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) connector,
you can create automated tasks and workflows that send email from your SMTP account.
You can also have other actions use the output from SMTP actions. For example,
after your SMTP sends an email, you can notify your team in Slack with the Slack connector.

The logic app where you want to access your SMTP account.
To use an SMTP action, start your logic app with a trigger,
such as a Salesforce trigger, if you have a Salesforce account.For example, you can start your logic app with theWhen a record is createdSalesforce trigger.
This trigger fires each time that a new record,
such as a lead, is created in Salesforce.
You can then follow this trigger with the SMTPSend Emailaction. That way, when the new
record is created, your logic app sends an email
from your SMTP account about the new record.

Your account credentials
A name to use for the connection
The name for the server or system
The authentication type to use
A connection string
