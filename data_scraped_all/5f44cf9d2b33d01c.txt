Important
Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local for Azure Government and Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure in China) is currently in preview with HCI version 22H2. Portal provisioning isn't available.
See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Using Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local, you can deploy session hosts for Azure Virtual Desktop where you need them. If you already have an existing on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployment, Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local can improve your experience. If you're already using Azure Virtual Desktop with your session hosts in Azure, you can extend your deployment to your on-premises infrastructure to better meet your performance or data locality needs.
Azure Virtual Desktop service components, such as host pools, workspaces, and application groups are all deployed in Azure, but you can choose to deploy session hosts on Azure Local. As Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local isn't an Azure Arc-enabled service, it's not supported as a standalone service outside of Azure, in a multicloud environment, or on other Azure Arc-enabled servers.
Benefits
Using Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local, you can:
Improve performance for Azure Virtual Desktop users in areas with poor connectivity to the Azure public cloud by giving them session hosts closer to their location.

Supported deployment configurations
Your Azure Local instances need to be running a minimum ofversion 23H2andregistered with Azure.
Once your instance is ready, you can use the following 64-bit operating system images for your session hosts that are in support:
Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session
Windows 11 Enterprise
Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session
Windows 10 Enterprise
Windows Server 2022
Windows Server 2019
To use session hosts on Azure Local with Azure Virtual Desktop, you also need to:
License and activate the virtual machines. For activating Windows 10 and Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, and Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, useAzure verification for VMs. For all other OS images (such as Windows 10 and Windows 11 Enterprise, and other editions of Windows Server), you should continue to use existing activation methods. For more information, seeActivate Windows Server VMs on Azure Local.

Install theAzure Connected Machine agenton the virtual machines so they can communicate withAzure Instance Metadata Service, which is arequired endpoint for Azure Virtual Desktop. The Azure Connected Machine agent is automatically installed when you add session hosts using the Azure portal as part of the process toDeploy Azure Virtual DesktoporAdd session hosts to a host pool.

Finally, users can connect using the sameRemote Desktop clientsas Azure Virtual Desktop.
Licensing and pricing
To run Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local, you need to make sure you're licensed correctly and be aware of the pricing model. There are three components that affect how much it costs to run Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local:
User access rights.The same licenses that grant access to Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure also apply to Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local. Learn more atAzure Virtual Desktop pricing.

Data storage
There are different classifications of data for Azure Virtual Desktop, such as customer input, customer data, diagnostic data, and service-generated data. With Azure Local, you can choose to store user data on-premises when you deploy session host virtual machines (VMs) and associated services such as file servers. However, some customer data, diagnostic data, and service-generated data is still stored in Azure. For more information on how Azure Virtual Desktop stores different kinds of data, seeâ¯Data locations for Azure Virtual Desktop.
FSLogix profile containers storage
To store FSLogix profile containers, you need to provide an SMB share. We recommend you create a VM-based file share cluster using Storage Spaces Direct on top of your Azure Local instance.
Here are the high-level steps you need to perform:
Deploy virtual machines on Azure Local. For more information, seeManage VMs with Windows Admin Center on Azure Local.

For storage redundancy and high availability, useStorage Spaces Direct in guest virtual machine clusters. For more information, seeDeploy Storage Spaces Direct on Windows Server.

For large Azure Virtual Desktop deployments that have high resource requirements, we recommend that the profile container storage is located external to Azure Local and on any separate SMB file share on the same network as your session hosts. This allows you to independently scale storage and compute resources for your profile management based on your usage needs independently of your Azure Local instance.
Limitations
Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Local has the following limitations:
Each host pool must only contain session hosts on Azure or on Azure Local. You can't mix session hosts on Azure and on Azure Local in the same host pool.

Azure Local supports many types of hardware and on-premises networking capabilities, so performance and user density might vary compared to session hosts running on Azure. Azure Virtual Desktop'svirtual machine sizing guidelinesare broad, so you should use them for initial performance estimates and monitor after deployment.

You can only join session hosts on Azure Local to an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. This includes usingMicrosoft Entra hybrid join, where you can benefit from some of the functionality provided by Microsoft Entra ID.
