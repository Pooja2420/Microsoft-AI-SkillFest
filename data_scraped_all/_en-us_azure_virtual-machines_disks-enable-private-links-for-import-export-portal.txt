You can useprivate endpointsto restrict the export and import of managed disks and more securely access data over aprivate linkfrom clients on your Azure virtual network. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the virtual network address space for your managed disks. Network traffic between clients on their virtual network and managed disks only traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.
To use Private Link to export and import managed disks, first you create a disk access resource and link it to a virtual network in the same subscription by creating a private endpoint. Then, associate a disk or a snapshot with a disk access instance.
Prerequisites
Limitations
You can't import or export more than five disks or snapshots at the same time with the same disk access object.
You can't upload to a disk with both a disk access object and a disk encryption set.

Select the virtual network to which you will limit disk import and export. This prevents the import and export of your disk to other virtual networks.NoteIf you have a network security group enabled for the selected subnet, it will be disabled for private endpoints on this subnet only. Other resources on this subnet will retain network security group enforcement.
