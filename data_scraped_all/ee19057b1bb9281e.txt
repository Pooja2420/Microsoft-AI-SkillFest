This article explains how to detect when data collection in Azure Monitor stops and details steps you can take to address data collection issues.
Important
If you're troubleshooting data collection for a scenario that uses a data collection rule (DCR) such as Azure Monitor agent or Logs ingestion API, seeMonitor and troubleshoot DCR data collection in Azure Monitorfor additional troubleshooting information.
Daily cap reached
Thedaily caplimits the amount of data that a Log Analytics workspace can collect in a day. When the daily cap is reached, data collection stops until the reset time. You can either wait for collection to automatically restart, or increase the daily data volume limit.
When data collection in a Log Analytics workspace stops, an event with a type ofOperationis created in the workspace. Run the following query to check whether you're reaching the daily limit and missing data:
Operation | where OperationCategory == 'Data Collection Status'
Operation | where OperationCategory == 'Data Collection Status'
When data collection stops, theOperationStatusisWarning. When data collection starts, theOperationStatusisSucceeded.
To be notified when data collection stops, use the steps described in theAlert when daily cap is reachedsection. To configure an e-mail, webhook, or runbook action for the alert rule, use the steps described increate an action group.
Ingestion volume rate limit reached
Thedefault ingestion volume rate limitfor data sent from Azure resources using diagnostic settings is approximately 6 GB/min per workspace. This is an approximate value because the actual size can vary between data types, depending on the log length and its compression ratio. This limit doesn't apply to data that's sent from agents or theLogs ingestion API.
If you send data at a higher rate to a single workspace, some data is dropped, and an event is sent to theOperationtable in your workspace every six hours while the threshold continues to be exceeded. If your ingestion volume continues to exceed the rate limit or you're expecting to reach it sometime soon, you can request an increase to your workspace by sending an email to LAIngestionRate@microsoft.com or by opening a support request.
Use this query to retrieve the record that indicates the data ingestion rate limit was reached.
Operation 
| where OperationCategory == "Ingestion" 
| where Detail startswith "The rate of data crossed the threshold"
Operation 
| where OperationCategory == "Ingestion" 
| where Detail startswith "The rate of data crossed the threshold"
Legacy free pricing tier daily ingestion limit reached
If your Log Analytics workspace is in thelegacy Free pricing tierand has collected more than 500 MB of data in a day, data collection stops for the rest of the day. Wait until the following day for collection to automatically restart, or change to a paid pricing tier.
Azure Monitor Agent not sending data
Azure Monitor Agentcollects data from virtual machines and sends the data to Azure Monitor. An agent might stop sending data to your Log Analytics workspace in various scenarios. For example, whenAzure Site Recoveryrecovers a virtual machine in a disaster recovery scenario, the resource ID of the machine changes, requiring reinstallation of Azure Monitor Agent on the machine.
Azure Monitor Agent instances installed on all virtual machines that send data to your Log Analytics workspace send a heartbeat to theHeartbeat tableevery minute.
Run this query to list VMs that haven't reported a heartbeat in the last five minutes:
Heartbeat 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize LastCall = max(TimeGenerated) by Computer, _ResourceId
| where LastCall < ago(5m)
Heartbeat 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize LastCall = max(TimeGenerated) by Computer, _ResourceId
| where LastCall < ago(5m)
Azure subscription is suspended
Your Azure subscription could be in a suspended state for one of the following reasons:
Free trial ended
Azure pass expired
Monthly spending limit reached (such as on an MSDN or Visual Studio subscription)
Other Log Analytics workspace limits
There are other Log Analytics limits, some of which depend on the Log Analytics pricing tier. For more information, seeAzure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints.
Next steps
SeeAnalyze usage in Log Analytics workspacefor details on analyzing the data in your workspace to determine to source of any higher than expected usage and opportunities to reduce your amount of data collected.
