Overview
Azure Blob Storageis a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS.
You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or to store application data privately. In this article, you'll learn how to use Storage Explorer
to work with blob containers and blobs.
Prerequisites
To complete the steps in this article, you'll need the following:
Download and install Storage Explorer
Connect to an Azure storage account or service
Create a blob container
All blobs must reside in a blob container, which is simply a logical grouping of blobs. An account can contain an unlimited number of containers, and each container can store an unlimited number of blobs.
The following steps illustrate how to create a blob container within Storage Explorer.
Open Storage Explorer.
Open Storage Explorer.
In the left pane, expand the storage account within which you wish to create the blob container.
In the left pane, expand the storage account within which you wish to create the blob container.
Right-clickBlob Containers, and - from the context menu - selectCreate Blob Container.
Right-clickBlob Containers, and - from the context menu - selectCreate Blob Container.

A text box will appear below theBlob Containersfolder. Enter the name for your blob container. SeeCreate a containerfor information on rules and restrictions on naming blob containers.

PressEnterwhen done to create the blob container, orEscto cancel. Once the blob container has been successfully created, it will be displayed under theBlob Containersfolder for the selected storage account.

View a blob container's contents
Blob containers contain blobs and virtual directories (that can also contain blobs).
The following steps illustrate how to view the contents of a blob container within Storage Explorer:
Open Storage Explorer.
Open Storage Explorer.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container you wish to view.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container you wish to view.
Expand the storage account'sBlob Containers.
Expand the storage account'sBlob Containers.
Right-click the blob container you wish to view, and - from the context menu - selectOpen Blob Container Editor.
You can also double-click the blob container you wish to view.
Right-click the blob container you wish to view, and - from the context menu - selectOpen Blob Container Editor.
You can also double-click the blob container you wish to view.

The main pane will display the blob container's contents.

Delete a blob container
Blob containers can be easily created and deleted as needed. (To see how to delete individual blobs,
refer to the section,Managing blobs in a blob container.)
The following steps illustrate how to delete a blob container within Storage Explorer:
Open Storage Explorer.
Open Storage Explorer.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container you wish to view.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container you wish to view.
Expand the storage account'sBlob Containers.
Expand the storage account'sBlob Containers.
Right-click the blob container you wish to delete, and - from the context menu - selectDelete.
You can also pressDeleteto delete the currently selected blob container.
Right-click the blob container you wish to delete, and - from the context menu - selectDelete.
You can also pressDeleteto delete the currently selected blob container.

SelectYesto the confirmation dialog.

Copy a blob container
Storage Explorer enables you to copy a blob container to the clipboard, and then paste that blob container into another storage account. (To see how to copy individual blobs,
refer to the section,Managing blobs in a blob container.)
The following steps illustrate how to copy a blob container from one storage account to another.
Open Storage Explorer.

In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container you wish to copy.

Right-click the blob container you wish to copy, and - from the context menu - selectCopy Blob Container.
Right-click the blob container you wish to copy, and - from the context menu - selectCopy Blob Container.

Right-click the desired "target" storage account into which you want to paste the blob container, and - from the context menu - selectPaste Blob Container.
Right-click the desired "target" storage account into which you want to paste the blob container, and - from the context menu - selectPaste Blob Container.

Get the SAS for a blob container
Ashared access signature (SAS)provides delegated access to resources in your storage account.
This means that you can grant a client limited permissions to objects in your storage account for a specified period of time and with a specified set of permissions, without having to
share your account access keys.
The following steps illustrate how to create a SAS for a blob container:
Open Storage Explorer.
Open Storage Explorer.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container for which you wish to get a SAS.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container for which you wish to get a SAS.
Expand the storage account'sBlob Containers.
Expand the storage account'sBlob Containers.
Right-click the desired blob container, and - from the context menu - selectGet Shared Access Signature.
Right-click the desired blob container, and - from the context menu - selectGet Shared Access Signature.

In theShared Access Signaturedialog, specify the policy, start and expiration dates, time zone, and access levels you want for the resource.

Manage Access Policies for a blob container
The following steps illustrate how to manage (add and remove) access policies for a blob container:
Open Storage Explorer.
Open Storage Explorer.
In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the blob container whose access policies you wish to manage.

Follow these steps depending on the access policy management task:Add a new access policy- SelectAdd. Once generated, theAccess Policiesdialog will display the newly added access policy (with default settings).Edit an access policy-  Make any desired edits, and selectSave.Remove an access policy- SelectRemovenext to the access policy you wish to remove.

Note
Modifying immutability policies is not supported from Storage Explorer.

and much more.
