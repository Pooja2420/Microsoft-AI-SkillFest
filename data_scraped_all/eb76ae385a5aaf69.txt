This article provides steps for provisioning an Azure-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) integration runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Synapse Pipelines. An Azure-SSIS IR supports:
Running packages deployed into SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL Database server/Managed Instance (Project Deployment Model)
Running packages deployed into file system, Azure Files, or SQL Server database (MSDB) hosted by Azure SQL Managed Instance (Package Deployment Model)
Note
There are certain features that aren't available for Azure-SSIS IR in Azure Synapse Analytics, check thelimitations.
After an Azure-SSIS IR is provisioned, you can use familiar tools to deploy and run your packages in Azure. These tools are already Azure-enabled and include SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and command-line utilities likedtutilandAzureDTExec.
TheProvisioning Azure-SSIS IRtutorial shows how to create an Azure-SSIS IR via the Azure portal or the Data Factory app. The tutorial also shows how to optionally use an Azure SQL Database server or managed instance to host SSISDB. This article expands on the tutorial and describes how to do these optional tasks:
Use an Azure SQL Database server with IP firewall rules/virtual network service endpoints or a managed instance with private endpoint to host SSISDB. As a prerequisite, you need to configure virtual network permissions and settings for your Azure-SSIS IR to join a virtual network.

Use Microsoft Entra authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your data factory to connect to an Azure SQL Database server or managed instance. As a prerequisite, you need to add the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your data factory as a database user who can create an SSISDB instance.

Join your Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network, or configure a self-hosted IR as proxy for your Azure-SSIS IR to access data on-premises.

These articles show how to provision an Azure-SSIS IR by using theAzure portal,Azure PowerShell, and anAzure Resource Manager template.
Prerequisites
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.

Azure SQL Database server or SQL Managed Instance (optional). If you don't already have a database server or managed instance, create one in the Azure portal before you get started. Data Factory will in turn create an SSISDB instance on this database server.We recommend that you create the database server or managed instance in the same Azure region as the integration runtime. This configuration lets the integration runtime write execution logs into SSISDB without crossing Azure regions.Keep these points in mind:The SSISDB instance can be created on your behalf as a single database, as part of an elastic pool, or in a managed instance. It can be accessible in a public network or by joining a virtual network. For guidance in choosing between SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance to host SSISDB, see theCompare SQL Database and SQL Managed Instancesection in this article.If you use an Azure SQL Database server with IP firewall rules/virtual network service endpoints or a SQL managed instance with private endpoint to host SSISDB, or if you require access to on-premises data without configuring a self-hosted IR, you need to join your Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network. For more information, seeJoin an Azure-SSIS IR to a virtual network.Confirm that theAllow access to Azure servicessetting is enabled for the database server. This setting isn't applicable when you use an Azure SQL Database server with IP firewall rules/virtual network service endpoints or a SQL managed instance with private endpoint to host SSISDB. For more information, seeSecure Azure SQL Database. To enable this setting by using PowerShell, seeNew-AzSqlServerFirewallRule.Add the IP address of the client machine, or a range of IP addresses that includes the IP address of the client machine, to the client IP address list in the firewall settings for the database server. For more information, seeAzure SQL Database server-level and database-level firewall rules.You can connect to the database server by using SQL authentication with your server admin credentials, or by using Microsoft Entra authentication with the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your data factory. For the latter, you need to add the specified system/user-assigned managed identity for your data factory into a Microsoft Entra group with access permissions to the database server. For more information, seeEnable Microsoft Entra authentication for an Azure-SSIS IR.Confirm that your database server doesn't have an SSISDB instance already. The provisioning of an Azure-SSIS IR doesn't support using an existing SSISDB instance.
