In this article, learn how to link work items to GitHub commits, pull requests, and branches after connecting your Azure Boards project with a GitHub repository. You can use the#mentionsyntax for commits and branches or add a GitHub commit, pull request, or branch link directly from the Azure Boards work item.
Note
With the Azure Boards app for GitHub, Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services integrate with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions support integration with GitHub Enterprise Server repositories only. Integration with other Git repositories is not supported.
Prerequisites
Note
Projects that use the Hosted XML process model require updates to the work item types to view the Development section and GitHub link types. For more information, seeUpdate XML definitions for select work item types.
UseAB#to link from GitHub to Azure Boards work items
AB#
From a GitHub commit, pull request or issue, use the following syntax to create a link to your Azure Boards work item. Enter theAB#IDwithin the text of a commit message. Or, for a pull request or issue, enter theAB#IDwithin the title or description. UsingAB#IDin a comment doesn't create a link on the work item.
AB#ID
AB#ID
AB#ID
AB#{ID}
AB#{ID}
For example,AB#125links to work item ID 125.
AB#125
You can also enter a commit or pull request message to transition the work item. The system recognizes{state}or{state category}, along withfix,fixes,fixed, and applies it to the #-mention item that follows.
{state}
{state category}
fix
fixes
fixed
When a pull request description includes a valid state name, for example,Closed AB#1234, the system updates the referenced work item to that specific state. If the state name isnât recognized directly, Azure Boards tries to match it to a workflow category likeResolvedorCompleted. If a match is found, the work item transitions to the first available state defined under that category.
Closed AB#1234
Resolved
Completed
By default, work items referenced withfix,fixes, orfixedtransitions to the first state associated with theResolvedcategory. If no such state exists in the current process, the system instead transitions the work item to the first state in theCompletedcategory.

Fixing multiple bugs: issue #123 and user story AB#234
Note
If you connected the same GitHub repo to projects defined in two or more Azure DevOps organizations, you might see unexpectedAB#mention linking. For more information, seeResolve connection issues. For this reason, we recommend that you only connect a GitHub repo to projects defined in a single Azure DevOps organization.

When you add a link to a work item using AB#, those links appear in theDevelopmentsection of the pull request.

Create GitHub branch from work item
To create a GitHub branch directly from a work item, do these steps:
From your board, find the work item from which you want to create a GitHub branch.
From your board, find the work item from which you want to create a GitHub branch.
SelectWork item actions>New GitHub branch.
SelectWork item actions>New GitHub branch.

In theCreate a GitHub branchdialog, enter the branch name, and select the GitHub repository and base branch.

Add work item link to GitHub branch, commit, or pull request
Open the work item and go to theLinkstab.

Note
There's a delay when completing the AB# links if you are using Azure DevOps Server and GitHub Enterprise Server. We have a 'push-and-pull' design to pull from the GitHub events every hour on the incremental changes on Commit, PR, and Issue.
Automatic link updates
Several events automatically update the links on the work item form, so you donât need to create them manually. These include:
View or open links from the Development section
The Development section within the work item form lists the links created to GitHub commits and pull requests with theGitHub icon.

Choose the link provided to open the commit or pull request in GitHub.

View GitHub objects on a board
With GitHub annotations enabled on the board, you can quickly open linked GitHub commits, pull requests, or issues for more detail. For more information, seeCustomize cards.
