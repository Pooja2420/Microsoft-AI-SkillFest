This article describes how to add IPv6 support to connect via ExpressRoute to your resources in Azure using Azure CLI.
Prerequisites
Review theprerequisitesandworkflowsbefore you begin configuration.
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Install the latest version of the CLI commands (2.0 or later). For information about installing the CLI commands, seeInstall the Azure CLIandGet Started with Azure CLI.
Azure Cloud Shell
Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.
To start Azure Cloud Shell:

Add IPv6 Private Peering to your ExpressRoute circuit
Create an ExpressRoute circuitor use an existing circuit. View the circuit details by running the following command:az network express-route show --resource-group "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --name "<MyCircuit>"
Create an ExpressRoute circuitor use an existing circuit. View the circuit details by running the following command:
az network express-route show --resource-group "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --name "<MyCircuit>"
az network express-route show --resource-group "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --name "<MyCircuit>"
View the private peering configuration for the circuit by running the following command:az network express-route peering show -g "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --circuit-name "<MyCircuit>" --name AzurePrivatePeering
View the private peering configuration for the circuit by running the following command:
az network express-route peering show -g "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --circuit-name "<MyCircuit>" --name AzurePrivatePeering
az network express-route peering show -g "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --circuit-name "<MyCircuit>" --name AzurePrivatePeering
Add an IPv6 Private Peering to your existing IPv4 Private Peering configuration. Provide a pair of /126 IPv6 subnets that you own for your primary link and secondary links. From each of these subnets, you assign the first usable IP address to your router as Microsoft uses the second usable IP for its router.az network express-route peering update -g "<ExpressRouteResourceGroup>" --circuit-name "<MyCircuit>" --name AzurePrivatePeering --ip-version ipv6 --primary-peer-subnet "<X:X:X:X/126>" --secondary-peer-subnet "<Y:Y:Y:Y/126>"

Update your connection to an existing virtual network
To use IPv6 Private Peering with your existing Azure resources, follow these steps:
Add an IPv6 address space to the virtual network that your ExpressRoute circuit is connected to.az network vnet update -g "<MyResourceGroup>" -n "<MyVNet>" --address-prefixes "X:X:X:X::/64"
Add an IPv6 address space to the virtual network that your ExpressRoute circuit is connected to.
az network vnet update -g "<MyResourceGroup>" -n "<MyVNet>" --address-prefixes "X:X:X:X::/64"
az network vnet update -g "<MyResourceGroup>" -n "<MyVNet>" --address-prefixes "X:X:X:X::/64"
Add IPv6 address space to your gateway subnet. The gateway IPv6 subnet should be /64 or larger.az network vnet subnet update -g "<MyResourceGroup>" -n "<MySubnet>" -vnet-name "<MyVNet>" --address-prefixes "10.0.0.0/26", "X:X:X:X::/64"
Add IPv6 address space to your gateway subnet. The gateway IPv6 subnet should be /64 or larger.
az network vnet subnet update -g "<MyResourceGroup>" -n "<MySubnet>" -vnet-name "<MyVNet>" --address-prefixes "10.0.0.0/26", "X:X:X:X::/64"
az network vnet subnet update -g "<MyResourceGroup>" -n "<MySubnet>" -vnet-name "<MyVNet>" --address-prefixes "10.0.0.0/26", "X:X:X:X::/64"
If you have an existing zone-redundant gateway, run the following to enable IPv6 connectivity (note that it can take up to 1 hour for changes to reflect). Otherwise,create the virtual network gatewayusing any SKU. If you plan to use FastPath, use UltraPerformance or ErGw3AZ (note that this feature is only available for circuits using ExpressRoute Direct).az network vnet-gateway update --name "<GatewayName>" --resource-group "<MyResourceGroup>"

Note
If you have an existing gateway that is not zone-redundant (meaning it is Standard, High Performance, or Ultra Performance SKU) and uses a public IP address of Basic SKU, you will need to delete andrecreate the gatewayusing any SKU and a Standard, Static public IP address.
Create a connection to a new virtual network
To connect to a new set of Azure resources via IPv6 Private Peering, apply the following steps:
Create a dual-stack virtual network with both IPv4 and IPv6 address space. For more information, seeCreate a virtual network.

Link your virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit.
Limitations
While IPv6 support is available for connections to deployments in global Azure regions, it doesn't support the following use cases:
Connections toexistingExpressRoute gateways that aren't zone-redundant.Newlycreated ExpressRoute gateways of any SKU (both zone-redundant and not) using  a Standard, Static IP address can be used for dual-stack ExpressRoute connections
Use of ExpressRoute with virtual WAN
FastPath with non-ExpressRoute Direct circuits
FastPath with circuits in the following peering locations: Dubai
Coexistence with VPN Gateway for IPv6 traffic. You can still configure coexistence with VPN Gateway in a dual-stack virtual network, but VPN Gateway only supports IPv4 traffic.
It isn't possible to connect a dual-stack ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway to an ExpressRoute Circuit that only has IPv4 enabled on the Private Peering. IPv6 must also be enabled on the ExpressRoute Circuit. You must also configure IPv6 on your on-premises CPE device.
