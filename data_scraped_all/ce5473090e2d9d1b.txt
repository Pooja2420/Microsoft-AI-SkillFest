There are many scenarios where you can't easily map your device data into the relatively small device-to-cloud messages that IoT Hub accepts. For example, sending large media files like video; or, sending large telemetry batches, either uploaded by intermittently connected devices or aggregated and compressed to save bandwidth.
When you need to upload large files from a device, you can still use the security and reliability of IoT Hub. Instead of brokering messages through itself, however, IoT Hub acts as a dispatcher to an associated Azure storage account. IoT Hub can also provide notification to backend services when a device completes a file upload.
If you need help with deciding when to use reported properties, device-to-cloud messages, or file uploads, seeDevice-to-cloud communications guidance.
Important
File upload functionality on devices that use X.509 certificate authority (CA) authentication is in public preview, andpreview mode must be enabled. It is generally available on devices that use X.509 thumbprint authentication or X.509 certificate attestation withAzure Device Provisioning Service. To learn more about X.509 authentication with IoT Hub, seeSupported X.509 certificates.
File upload overview
An IoT hub facilitates file uploads from connected devices by providing them with shared access signature (SAS) URIs on a per-upload basis for a blob container and Azure storage account that are configured for file upload from the hub. There are three parts to using file uploads with IoT Hub:
Configuring an Azure storage account and blob container on your IoT hub.
Uploading files from devices.
Optionally, notifying backend services of completed file uploads.
Before you can use the file upload feature, you must associate anAzure storage accountandblob containerwith your IoT hub. You can also configure settings that control how IoT Hub authenticates with Azure storage, the time-to-live (TTL) of the SAS URIs that the IoT hub hands out to devices, and file upload notifications to your backend services. To learn more, seeAssociate an Azure storage account with IoT Hub.
Devices follow a three-step process to upload a file to the associated blob container:
The device initiates the file upload with the IoT hub. It passes the name of a blob in the request and gets a SAS URI and a correlation ID in return. The SAS URI contains a SAS token for Azure storage that grants the device read-write permission on the requested blob in the blob container. For more information, seeDevice: Initialize a file upload.

The SAS URI contains a SAS token for Azure storage that grants the device read-write permission on the requested blob in the blob container. For more information, seeDevice: Initialize a file upload.
The device uses the SAS URI to securely call Azure blob storage APIs to upload the file to the blob container. For more information, seeDevice: Upload file using Azure storage APIs.
The device uses the SAS URI to securely call Azure blob storage APIs to upload the file to the blob container. For more information, seeDevice: Upload file using Azure storage APIs.
When the file upload is complete, the device notifies the IoT hub of the completion status using the correlation ID it received from IoT Hub when it initiated the upload. For more information, seeDevice: Notify IoT Hub of a completed file upload.
When the file upload is complete, the device notifies the IoT hub of the completion status using the correlation ID it received from IoT Hub when it initiated the upload. For more information, seeDevice: Notify IoT Hub of a completed file upload.
Backend services can subscribe to file upload notifications on the IoT hub's service-facing file upload notification endpoint. If you enabled these notifications on your IoT hub, it delivers them on this endpoint whenever a device notifies the hub that it completed a file upload. Services can use these notifications to trigger further processing of the blob data. For more information, seeService: File upload notifications.
The Azure IoT device and service SDKs fully support file upload. For more information, seeFile upload using an SDK.
File upload quotas and limits
IoT Hub imposes throttling limits on the number of file uploads that it can initiate in a given period. The threshold is based on the SKU and number of units of your IoT hub. Additionally, each device is limited to 10 concurrent active file uploads at a time. For more information, seeIoT Hub quotas and throttling.
Associate an Azure storage account with IoT Hub
You must associate an Azure storage account and  blob container with your IoT hub to use file upload features. All file uploads from devices registered with your IoT hub go to this container. To configure a storage account and blob container on your IoT hub, seeConfigure IoT Hub file uploads using the Azure portal,Configure IoT Hub file uploads using Azure CLI, orConfigure IoT Hub file uploads using PowerShell. You can also use the IoT Hub management APIs to configure file uploads programmatically.
By default, Azure IoT Hub uses key-based authentication to connect and authorize with Azure Storage. You can also configure user-assigned or system-assigned managed identities to authenticate Azure IoT Hub with Azure Storage. Managed identities provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID in a secure manner.
File upload is subject toAzure Storage's firewall settings. You need to ensure your devices can communicate with Azure storage according to your authentication configuration.
There are several other settings that control the behavior of file uploads and file upload notifications. The following sections list all of the settings available. Depending on whether you use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or the management APIs to configure file uploads, some of these settings might not be available. Make sure to set theenableFileUploadNotificationssetting if you want notifications sent to your backend services when a file upload completes.
IoT Hub storage and authentication settings
The following settings associate a storage account and container with your IoT hub and control how your hub authenticates with Azure storage. These settings don't affect how devices authenticate with Azure storage. You still need to connect your devices to storage using the SAS URI. Today the SAS URI is generated using connection string.
For information about configuring file upload to use identity-based authentication, seeConfigure file upload with managed identities.

File upload using an SDK
The following how-to guides provide complete, step-by-step instructions to upload files using the Azure IoT device and service SDKs. The guides show you how to use the Azure portal to associate a storage account with an IoT hub. The guides also contain code snippets or refer to samples that guide you through an upload.
Note
The C device SDK uses a single call on the device client to perform file uploads. For more information, seeIoTHubDeviceClient_UploadToBlobAsync()andIoTHubDeviceClient_UploadMultipleBlocksToBlobAsync(). These functions perform all aspects of the file upload in a single call: initiating the upload, uploading the file to Azure storage, and notifying IoT Hub when it completes. This interaction means that, in addition to whatever protocol the device is using to communicate with IoT Hub, the device also needs to be able to communicate over HTTPS with Azure storage as these functions make calls to the Azure storage APIs.
Device: Initialize a file upload
The device calls theCreate File Upload SAS URIREST API or the equivalent API in one of the device SDKs to initiate a file upload.
Supported protocols: HTTPSEndpoint: {iot hub}.azure-devices.net/devices/{deviceId}/filesMethod: POST
{
    "blobName":"myfile.txt"
}
{
    "blobName":"myfile.txt"
}
IoT Hub responds with a correlation ID and the elements of a SAS URI that the device can use to authenticate with Azure storage. This response is subject to the throttling limits and per-device upload limits of the target IoT hub.

Device: Notify IoT Hub of a completed file upload
The device calls theUpdate File Upload StatusREST API or the equivalent API in one of the device SDKs when it completes the file upload. The device should update the file upload status with IoT Hub regardless of whether the upload succeeds or fails.
Supported protocols: HTTPSEndpoint: {iot hub}.azure-devices.net/devices/{deviceId}/files/notificationsMethod: POST
{
    "correlationId": "MjAyMTA3MzAwNjIxXzBiNjgwOGVkLWZjNzQtN...MzYzLWRlZmI4OWQxMzdmNF9teWZpbGUudHh0X3ZlcjIuMA==",
    "isSuccess": true,
    "statusCode": 200,
    "statusDescription": "File uploaded successfully"
}

    "correlationId": "MjAyMTA3MzAwNjIxXzBiNjgwOGVkLWZjNzQtN...MzYzLWRlZmI4OWQxMzdmNF9teWZpbGUudHh0X3ZlcjIuMA==",
    "isSuccess": true,
    "statusCode": 200,
    "statusDescription": "File uploaded successfully"
}
When it receives a file upload complete notification from the device, IoT Hub:
Triggers a file upload notification to backend services if file upload notifications are configured.

Service: File upload notifications
If file upload notifications are enabled on your IoT hub, your hub generates a notification message for backend services when it receives notification from a device that a file upload is complete. IoT Hub delivers these file upload notifications through a service-facing endpoint. The receive semantics for file upload notifications are the same as for cloud-to-device messages and have the samemessage life cycle. The service SDKs expose APIs to handle file upload notifications.
Supported protocolsAMQP, AMQP-WSEndpoint: {iot hub}.azure-devices.net/messages/servicebound/fileuploadnotificationsMethodGET
Each message retrieved from the file upload notification endpoint is a JSON record:
{
    "deviceId":"mydevice",
    "blobUri":"https://contosostorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/device-upload-container/mydevice/myfile.txt",
    "blobName":"mydevice/myfile.txt",
    "lastUpdatedTime":"2021-07-31T00:26:50+00:00",
    "blobSizeInBytes":11,
    "enqueuedTimeUtc":"2021-07-31T00:26:51.5134008Z"
}
{
    "deviceId":"mydevice",
    "blobUri":"https://contosostorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/device-upload-container/mydevice/myfile.txt",
    "blobName":"mydevice/myfile.txt",
    "lastUpdatedTime":"2021-07-31T00:26:50+00:00",
    "blobSizeInBytes":11,
    "enqueuedTimeUtc":"2021-07-31T00:26:51.5134008Z"
}
{device ID of the device}/{name of the blob}
Services can use notifications to manage uploads. For example, they can trigger their own processing of the blob data, trigger processing of the blob data using other Azure services, or log the file upload notification for later review.
