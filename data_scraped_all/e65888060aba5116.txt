This tutorial describes how to back up a SQL Server database running on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault.
Prerequisites
Before you back up your SQL Server database, check the following conditions:
Identify orcreatea Recovery Services vault in the same region or locale as the VM hosting the SQL Server instance.
Check the VM permissionsneeded to back up the SQL databases.
Verify that the  VM hasnetwork connectivity.
Check that the SQL Server databases are named in accordance withnaming guidelinesfor Azure Backup.
Verify that you don't have any other backup solutions enabled for the database. Disable all other SQL Server backups before you set up this scenario. You can enable Azure Backup for an Azure VM along with Azure Backup for a SQL Server database running on the VM without any conflict.
Create a Recovery Services vault
A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points that are created over time, and it provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies.
To create a Recovery Services vault:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search forBusiness Continuity Center, and then go to theBusiness Continuity Centerdashboard.

On theRecovery Services vaultpane, enter the following values:Subscription: Select the subscription to use. If you're a member of only one subscription, you'll see that name. If you're not sure which subscription to use, use the default subscription. There are multiple choices only if your work or school account is associated with more than one Azure subscription.Resource group: Use an existing resource group or create a new one. To view a list of available resource groups in your subscription, selectUse existing, and then select a resource in the dropdown list. To create a new resource group, selectCreate new, and then enter the name. For more information about resource groups, seeAzure Resource Manager overview.Vault name: Enter a friendly name to identify the vault. The name must be unique to the Azure subscription. Specify a name that has at least 2 but not more than 50 characters. The name must start with a letter and consist only of letters, numbers, and hyphens.Region: Select the geographic region for the vault. For you to create a vault to help protect any data source, the vaultmustbe in the same region as the data source.ImportantIf you're not sure of the location of your data source, close the window. Go to the list of your resources in the portal. If you have data sources in multiple regions, create a Recovery Services vault for each region. Create the vault in the first location before you create a vault in another location. There's no need to specify storage accounts to store the backup data. The Recovery Services vault and Azure Backup handle that automatically.

Important
If you're not sure of the location of your data source, close the window. Go to the list of your resources in the portal. If you have data sources in multiple regions, create a Recovery Services vault for each region. Create the vault in the first location before you create a vault in another location. There's no need to specify storage accounts to store the backup data. The Recovery Services vault and Azure Backup handle that automatically.

Note
Azure Backup now supports immutable vaults that help you ensure that recovery points once created can't be deleted before their expiry as per the backup policy. You can make the immutability irreversible for maximum protection to your backup data from various threats, including ransomware attacks and malicious actors.Learn more.

Create a backup policy
A backup policy defines when backups are taken and how long they're retained.
A policy is created at the vault level.
Multiple vaults can use the same backup policy, but you must apply the backup policy to each vault.
When you create a backup policy, a daily full backup is the default.
You can add a differential backup, but only if you configure full backups to occur weekly.
Learn aboutdifferent types of backup policies.
To create a backup policy:
Go toBackup centerand click+Policy.

SelectSQL Server in Azure VMas the datasource type, select the vault under which the policy should be created, and then clickContinue.

InRETENTION RANGE, all options are selected by default. Clear any retention range limits that you don't want, and then set the intervals to use.Minimum retention period for any type of backup (full, differential, and log) is seven days.Recovery points are tagged for retention based on their retention range. For example, if you select a daily full backup, only one full backup is triggered each day.The backup for a specific day is tagged and retained based on the weekly retention range and the weekly retention setting.Monthly and yearly retention ranges behave in a similar way.

On theBackup policymenu, choose whether to enableSQL Backup Compressionor not. This option is disabled by default. If enabled, SQL Server will send a compressed backup stream to the VDI. Azure Backup overrides instance level defaults with COMPRESSION / NO_COMPRESSION clause depending on the value of this control.

Note
Each log backup is chained to the previous full backup to form a recovery chain. This full backup will be retained until the retention of the last log backup has expired. This might mean that the full backup is retained for an extra period to make sure all the logs can be recovered. Let's assume you have a weekly full backup, daily differential and 2 hour logs. All of them are retained for 30 days. But, the weekly full can be really cleaned up/deleted only after the next full backup is available, that is, after 30 + 7 days. For example, a weekly full backup happens on Nov 16th. According to the retention policy, it should be retained until Dec 16th. The last log backup for this full happens before the next scheduled full, on Nov 22nd. Until this log is available until Dec 22nd, the Nov 16th full can't be deleted. So, the Nov 16th full is retained until Dec 22nd.

Select "SQL in Azure VM".
Right-click on a database, and choose "Backup now".
