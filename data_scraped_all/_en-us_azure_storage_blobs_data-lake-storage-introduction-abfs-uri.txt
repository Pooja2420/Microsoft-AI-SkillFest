TheHadoop Filesystemdriver that is compatible with Azure Data Lake Storage is known by its scheme identifierabfs(Azure Blob File System). Consistent with other Hadoop Filesystem drivers, the ABFS driver employs a URI format to address files and directories within a Data Lake Storage enabled account.
abfs
URI syntax
The Azure Blob File System driver can be used with the Data Lake Storage endpoint of an account even if that account does not have a hierarchical namespace enabled. If the storage account does not have a hierarchical namespace, then the shorthand URI syntax is:
abfs[s]1://<file_system>2@<account_name>3.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>4/<file_name>5
Scheme identifier: Theabfsprotocol is used as the scheme identifier. If you add ansat the end (abfss) then the ABFS Hadoop client driver will always use Transport Layer Security (TLS) irrespective of the authentication method chosen. If you choose OAuth as your authentication, then the client driver will always use TLS even if you specifyabfsinstead ofabfssbecause OAuth solely relies on the TLS layer. Finally, if you choose to use the older method of storage account key, then the client driver interpretsabfsto mean that you don't want to use TLS.

However, if the account you want to address does have a hierarchical namespace, then the shorthand URI syntax is:
/<path>1/<file_name>2
