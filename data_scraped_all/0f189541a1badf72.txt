Quickstart: Create an Azure Databricks workspace in your own Virtual Network

In this article
The default deployment of Azure Databricks creates a new virtual network that is managed by Databricks. This quickstart shows how to create an Azure Databricks workspace in your own virtual network instead. You also create an Apache Spark cluster within that workspace.
For more information about why you might choose to create an Azure Databricks workspace in your own virtual network, seeDeploy Azure Databricks in your Azure Virtual Network (VNet Injection).
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree account. This tutorial cannot be carried out using anAzure Free Trial Subscription. If you have a free account, go to your profile and change your subscription topay-as-you-go. For more information, seeAzure free account. Then,remove the spending limit, andrequest a quota increasefor vCPUs in your region. When you create your Azure Databricks workspace, you can select theTrial (Premium - 14-Days Free DBUs)pricing tier to give the workspace access to free Premium Azure Databricks DBUs for 14 days.

If you want to create an Azure Databricks workspace in the Azure Commercial Cloud that holds US Government compliance certifications like FedRAMP High, please reach out to your Microsoft or Databricks account team to gain access to this experience.
Create a virtual network
From the Azure portal menu, selectCreate a resource. Then selectNetworking > Virtual network.
From the Azure portal menu, selectCreate a resource. Then selectNetworking > Virtual network.

UnderCreate virtual network, apply the following settings:SettingSuggested valueDescriptionSubscription<Your subscription>Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.Resource groupdatabricks-quickstartSelectCreate Newand enter a new resource group name for your account.Namedatabricks-quickstartSelect a name for your virtual network.Region<Select the region that is closest to your users>Select a geographic location where you can host your virtual network. Use the location that's closest to your users.
UnderCreate virtual network, apply the following settings:

SelectNext: IP Addresses >and apply the following settings. Then selectReview + create.SettingSuggested valueDescriptionIPv4 address space10.2.0.0/16The virtual network's address range in CIDR notation. The CIDR range must be between /16 and /24Subnet namedefaultSelect a name for the default subnet in your virtual network.Subnet Address range10.2.0.0/24The subnet's address range in CIDR notation. It must be contained by the address space of the virtual network. The address range of a subnet which is in use can't be edited.
SelectNext: IP Addresses >and apply the following settings. Then selectReview + create.

On theReview + createtab, selectCreateto deploy the virtual network. Once the deployment is complete, navigate to your virtual network and selectAddress spaceunderSettings. In the box that saysAdd additional address range, insert10.179.0.0/16and selectSave.

Create an Azure Databricks workspace
From the Azure portal menu, selectCreate a resource. Then selectAnalytics > Databricks.
From the Azure portal menu, selectCreate a resource. Then selectAnalytics > Databricks.

UnderAzure Databricks Service, apply the following settings:SettingSuggested valueDescriptionWorkspace namedatabricks-quickstartSelect a name for your Azure Databricks workspace.Subscription<Your subscription>Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.Resource groupdatabricks-quickstartSelect the same resource group you used for the virtual network.Location<Select the region that is closest to your users>Choose the same location as your virtual network.Pricing TierChoose between Standard or Premium.For more information on pricing tiers, see theDatabricks pricing page.
UnderAzure Databricks Service, apply the following settings:

Once you've finished entering settings on theBasicspage, selectNext: Networking >and apply the following settings:SettingSuggested valueDescriptionDeploy Azure Databricks workspace in your Virtual Network (VNet)YesThis setting allows you to deploy an Azure Databricks workspace in your virtual network.Virtual Networkdatabricks-quickstartSelect the virtual network you created in the previous section.Public Subnet Namepublic-subnetUse the default public subnet name.Public Subnet CIDR Range10.179.64.0/18Use a CIDR range up to and including /26.Private Subnet Nameprivate-subnetUse the default private subnet name.Private Subnet CIDR Range10.179.0.0/18Use a CIDR range up to and including /26.

Once the deployment is complete, navigate to the Azure Databricks resource. Notice that virtual network peering is disabled. Also notice the resource group and managed resource group in the overview page.The managed resource group is not modifiable, and it is not used to create virtual machines. You can only create virtual machines in the resource group you manage.When a workspace deployment fails, the workspace is still created in a failed state. Delete the failed workspace and create a new workspace that resolves the deployment errors. When you delete the failed workspace, the managed resource group and any successfully deployed resources are also deleted.

Create a cluster
Note
To use a free account to create the Azure Databricks cluster, before creating the cluster, go to your profile and change your subscription topay-as-you-go. For more information, seeAzure free account.
Return to your Azure Databricks service and selectLaunch Workspaceon theOverviewpage.

SelectClusters>+ Create Cluster. Then create a cluster name, likedatabricks-quickstart-cluster, and accept the remaining default settings. SelectCreate Cluster.

Once the cluster is running, return to the managed resource group in the Azure portal. Notice the new virtual machines, disks, IP Address, and network interfaces. A network interface is created in each of the public and private subnets with IP addresses.

Return to your Azure Databricks workspace and select the cluster you created. Then navigate to theExecutorstab on theSpark UIpage. Notice that the addresses for the driver and the executors are in the private subnet range. In this example, the driver is 10.179.0.6 and executors are 10.179.0.4 and 10.179.0.5. Your IP addresses could be different.

Your IP addresses could be different.

Clean up resources
After you have finished the article, you can terminate the cluster. To do so, from the Azure Databricks workspace, from the left pane, selectClusters. For the cluster you want to terminate, move the cursor over the ellipsis underActionscolumn, and select theTerminateicon. This stops the cluster.
If you do not manually terminate the cluster it will automatically stop, provided you selected theTerminate after __ minutes of inactivitycheckbox while creating the cluster. In such a case, the cluster automatically stops, if it has been inactive for the specified time.
If you do not wish to reuse the cluster, you can delete the resource group you created in the Azure portal.
