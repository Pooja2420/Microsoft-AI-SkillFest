With this update, we've improved the Kanban board user experience (UX). You can now use the filter to generate a specific search of work items to include in the Kanban board. By using the filter you can generate a more specific search and eliminate the need to re-click theShow more itemsbutton.
Check out the release notes for details.

Azure Boards
Improved "Show more items" UX
The Kanban board gives you a visual interactive space, which provides a visual flow of work. Boards present work items as cards and support quick status updates through drag-and-drop, similar to sticky notes on a physical whiteboard.
Previously, the Kanban boardShow more itemsfeature fetched the next 200 work items, regardless of your filter. With this update, we have improved that experience by using the filter to generate a more specific search. When the filter is applied and you click theShow more itemsbutton, the system will use the filter to generate and execute a more specific Work Item Query Language (WIQL) query. This should eliminate the need to re-click theShow more itemsbutton.

Note
This feature is available with theNew Boards Hubspreview.
General availability of Copy Dashboard
Copy Dashboard is now generally available. Copy Dashboard lets you copy a dashboard to the same or a new project. To copy a dashboard:
Go to the dashboard you want to copy. From there click the menu to bring upCopy Dashboardand then click on it.

Enter the name and description of the new dashboard, then select the dashboard type, Team or Project. When selecting a Team Dashboard, the new project and team are selected from the project and team drop down boxes respectively. For a Project dashboard, only the project is required.

Azure Pipelines
Ubuntu 22.04 in preview for Azure Pipelines hosted pools
The Ubuntu 22.04 image is now available in preview for Azure Pipelines hosted agents. To use this image, update your YAML file to includevmImage:'ubuntu-22.04':
vmImage:'ubuntu-22.04'
- job: ubuntu2204
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-22.04'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from Ubuntu 22.04 Preview
      lsb_release -d
- job: ubuntu2204
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-22.04'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from Ubuntu 22.04 Preview
      lsb_release -d
The ubuntu-latest image label will continue to point to ubuntu-20.04 until ubuntu-22.04 comes out of preview later this year. While the Ubuntu 22.04 image is in preview, it currently doesn't support all of the tooling available in ubuntu-20.04 and you may experience longer queue times than other images. For more information, check thevirtual-environments repositoryandUbuntu image configurations.
Preview of macOS 12 Monterey for Azure Pipeline hosted pools
The macOS 12 image is now available in preview for Azure Pipelines hosted agents. To use this image, update your YAML file to includevmImage:'macos-12':

- job: macOS12
  pool:
    vmImage: 'macOS-12'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from macOS Monterey Preview
      sw_vers
- job: macOS12
  pool:
    vmImage: 'macOS-12'
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo Hello from macOS Monterey Preview
      sw_vers
The macos-latest image label will continue to point to macos-11 until macos-12 comes out of preview later this year.
