This tutorial shows you how to set up disaster recovery for Azure VMs usingAzure Site Recovery. In this article, you learn how to:
Verify Azure settings and permissions
Prepare VMs you want to replicate
Create a Recovery Services vault
Enable VM replication
When you enablereplicationfor a VM to set up disaster recovery, the Site Recovery Mobility service extension installs on the VM, and registers it with Azure Site Recovery. During replication, VM disk writes are sent to a cache storage account in the source region. Data is sent from there to the target region, and recovery points are generated from the data. When you fail over a VM during disaster recovery, a recovery point is used to restore the VM in the target region.Learn moreabout the architecture.
Note
Tutorials provide instructions with the simplest default settings. If you want to set up Azure VM disaster recovery with customized settings, reviewthis article.
If you donât have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial:
Review supported regions.
You need one or more Azure VMs. Verify thatWindowsorLinuxVMs are supported.
Review VMcompute,storage, andnetworkingrequirements.
This tutorial presumes that VMs aren't encrypted. If you want to set up disaster recovery for encrypted VMs,follow this article.
Check Azure settings
Check permissions and settings in the target region.
Check permissions
Your Azure account needs permissions to create a Recovery Services vault, and to create VMs in the target region.
If you just created a free Azure subscription, you're the account admin, and no further action is needed.
If you aren't the admin, work with the admin to get the permissions you need.Microsoft Entra ID: Application owner and application developer roles to enable replication.Create a vault: Admin or owner permissions on the subscription.Manage Site Recovery operations in the vault: TheSite Recovery Contributorbuilt-in Azure role.Create Azure VMs in the target region: Either the built-inVirtual Machine Contributorrole, or specific permissions to:Create a VM in the selected virtual network.Write to an Azure storage account.Write to an Azure-managed disk.

Create a VM in the selected virtual network.
Write to an Azure storage account.
Write to an Azure-managed disk.
Verify target settings
During disaster recovery, when you fail over from the source region, VMs are created in the target region.
Check that your subscription has enough resources in the target region. You need to be able to create VMs with sizes that match VMs in the source region. When you set up disaster recovery, Site Recovery picks the same size (or the closest possible size) for the target VM.
Prepare VMs
Make sure VMs have outbound connectivity, and the latest root certificates.
Set up VM connectivity
VMs that you want to replicate need outbound network connectivity.
Note
Site Recovery doesn't support using an authentication proxy to control network connectivity.
If you're using a URL-based firewall proxy to control outbound connectivity, allow access to these URLs:
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net
login.microsoftonline.com
login.microsoftonline.us
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com
*.servicebus.windows.net
*.servicebus.usgovcloudapi.net
If you're using network security groups (NSGs) to control connectivity, create a service-tag based NSG rules that allow HTTPS outbound to port 443 for theseservice tags(groups of IP addresses):
Learn moreabout required tags and tagging examples.
Azure Site Recovery mobility agent usesAzure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)to get virtual machine security type. Communications between VM and IMDS never leaves the host. Ensure that you bypass the IP169.254.169.254when using any proxies.
169.254.169.254
Verify VM certificates
Check that the VMs have the latest root certificates. Otherwise, the VM can't be registered with Site Recovery because of security constraints.
Windows VMs: Install all the latest Windows updates on the VM, so that all the trusted root certificates are on the machine. In a disconnected environment, follow your standard processes for Windows Update, and certificate updates.
Linux VMs: Follow the guidance provided by your Linux distributor, to get the latest trusted root certificates and certificate revocation list (CRL).
Create a Recovery Services vault
Create a Recovery Services vault in any region, except in the source region from which you want to replicate VMs.

Review replication settings
InReplication settings, review the settings. Site Recovery creates default settings/policy for the target region. For the purposes of this tutorial, we use the default settings.NoteAzure Site Recovery has aHigh Churnoption that you can choose to protect VMs with high data change rate. With this, you can use aPremium Block Blobtype of storage account. By default, theNormal Churnoption is selected. For more information, seeAzure VM Disaster Recovery - High Churn Support. You can select theHigh Churnoption fromStorage>View/edit storage configuration>Churn for the VM.

Manage
InManage, do the following:UnderReplication policy,Replication policy: Select the replication policy. Defines the settings for recovery point retention history and app-consistent snapshot frequency. By default, Site Recovery creates a new replication policy with default settings of 24 hours for recovery point retention.Replication group: Create replication group to replicate VMs together to generate Multi-VM consistent recovery points. Note that enabling multi-VM consistency can impact workload performance and should only be used if machines are running the same workload and you need consistency across multiple machines.UnderExtension settings,SelectUpdate settingsandAutomation account.
