Step 1: Register Network resource provider
If you haven't already done so, register theNetworkresource provider in the subscription hosting the Azure Synapse Workspace. Registering a resource provider configures your subscription to work with the resource provider.
In the Azure portal, select your subscription.
UnderSettings, selectResource providers.
ChooseMicrosoft.Networkfrom the list of resource providers andregister.
If you're creating a private endpoint in a different subscription than the subscription hosting the Azure Synapse Workspace, registerMicrosoft.Synapsein the subscription hosting the private endpoint. This is required when trying to approve or delete the private endpoint connection.
If the required resource provider is already registered, then proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: Open your Azure Synapse workspace in Azure portal
In the Azure portal, on your workspace page, select thePrivate endpoint connectionspage underSecurity.
