This article provides details on enablingVM Insightsin Azure Monitor using different methods including the Azure portal, ARM templates, and PowerShell script.
Warning
If your virtual machine already has VM insights enabled using the deprecated Log Analytics agent, seeMigrate to Azure Monitor Agent from Log Analytics agent in VM Insightsfor guidance on migrating to the Azure Monitor agent. Ensure that you remove the Log Analytics agent in order to prevent duplicate data collection with both agents installed.
Prerequisites
You must have aLog Analytics workspaceto store data collected by VM insights. You can create a new workspace if you enable using the Azure portal.
You require permissions to create a data collection rule (DCR) and associate it with the Azure Monitor agent. SeeData Collection Rule permissionsfor details.
SeeAzure Monitor agent supported operating systems and environmentsto verify that your operating system is supported by Azure Monitor agent.
SeeManage the Azure Monitor agentfor prerequisites related to Azure Monitor agent.
SeeAzure Monitor agent network configurationfor network requirements for the Azure Monitor agent.
SeeDependency Agent requirementsto verify that your operating system is supported by Dependency agent and for network requirements for the Dependency agent.
Agents
When you enable VM Insights for a machine, the following agents are installed.
Azure Monitor agent: Collects data from the machine and delivers it to a Log Analytics workspace.
Dependency agent: Collects discovered data about processes running on the virtual machine and external process dependencies to support theMap feature in VM Insights. This agent is not required for other VM insights functionality, so you don't need to install the dependency agent if you're not going to use the Map feature.
VM insights DCR
Data collection rules (DCRs)are used by the Azure Monitor agent to specify which data to collect and how it should be processed. When you enable VM Insights, you create a DCR specifically for VM insights and associate it with the Azure Monitor agent on any machines to monitor.
The only configuration in a VM insights DCR is the Log Analytics workspace and whether or not to collect processes and dependencies data. Instead of creating a separate DCR for each machine, you should use a single DCR for each Log Analytics workspace you use for VM insights and associate that DCR with multiple machines. You may want to create separate DCRs if you want to collect processes and dependencies from some machines but not from others.
You shouldn't modify the VM insights DCR. If you need to collect additional data from the monitored machines, such as event logs and security logs, create additional DCRs and associate them with the same machines. You can get guidance for creating these DCRs fromCollect data with Azure Monitor Agent.

Create a VM insights DCR
There are two methods to create a VM insights DCR. Regardless of the method you choose, the DCR is identical and can be used with any process to enable VM insights on other machines. While not required, you should name the DCRMSVMI-{WorkspaceName}to match the naming convention used by the Azure portal.

Enable network isolation using Private Link
By default, Azure Monitor Agent connects to a public endpoint to connect to your Azure Monitor environment. To enable network isolation for VM Insights, associate your VM Insights DCR to a data collection endpoint (DCE) linked to an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope as described inEnable network isolation for Azure Monitor Agent by using Private Link.

Enable VM insights using the Azure portal
Use the following procedure to enable VM insights on an unmonitored virtual machine or Virtual Machine Scale Set. This process doesn't require you to deploy agents or create a VM insights DCR first since these tasks are performed by the portal.
Note
As part of the Azure Monitor Agent installation process, Azure assigns asystem-assigned managed identityto the machine if such an identity doesn't already exist.
From theMonitormenu in the Azure portal, selectVirtual Machines>Not Monitored. This tab includes all machines that don't have VM insights enabled. Any machines have Azure Monitor agent installed. If a virtual machine has the Log Analytics agent installed but not the Dependency agent, it will be listed as not monitored.

If a DCR hasn't already been created for VM insights, Azure Monitor offers to create one with a default Log Analytics workspace and the following settings. You can either accept these defaults or clickCreate Newto create a new DCR with different settings. This lets you select a workspace and specify whether to collect processes and dependencies using theVM insights Map feature.Guest performanceenabled.Processes and dependenciesdisabled.NoteIf you select a DCR with Map enabled and your virtual machine is notsupported by the Dependency Agent, Dependency Agent will be installed and  will run in degraded mode.

Enable VM insights using ARM templates
There are three steps to enabling VM insights using ARM templates. Each of these steps is described in detail in the following sections.
Deploy agents
Install the required agents on your machines using guidance in the following articles. Dependency agent is only required if you want to enable the Map feature.
Azure Monitor Agent for Linux or Windows.
Dependency agent for LinuxorDependency agent or Windowsif you want to enable the Map feature.
Note
If your virtual machines scale sets have an upgrade policy set to manual, VM insights will not be enabled for instances by default after installing the template. You must manually upgrade the instances.
Create data collection rule (DCR)
If you don't already have a DCR for VM insights, create one using the details above inVM insights DCR.
Associate DCR with agents
The final step in enabling VM insights is to associate the DCR with the Azure Monitor agent. Use the template below which comes fromManage data collection rule associations in Azure Monitor. To enable on multiple machines, you need to create an association using this template for each one. SeeDeploy templatesif you aren't familiar with methods to deploy ARM templates.
Note
If you associate a DCR with the Map feature enabled to a machine on which Dependency Agent isn't installed, the Map view won't be available. To enable the Map view, setenableAMA property = truein the Dependency Agent extension when youinstall Dependency Agent.
enableAMA property = true

Deploy ARM templates
The ARM templates described in this section can be deployed using any method to install anARM template. SeeQuickstart: Create and deploy ARM templates by using the Azure portalfor details on deploying a template from the Azure portal.
The following examples show how to deploy the templates from command line using common methods.

Enable VM insights for multiple VMs using PowerShell script
This section describes how to enableVM insightsusing a PowerShell script that can enable multiple VMs. This process uses a script that installs VM extensions for Azure Monitoring agent (AMA) and, if necessary, the Dependency Agent to enable VM Insights.
Before you use this script, you must create a VM insights DCR using the details above inVM insights DCR.
PowerShell script
Use the PowerShell scriptInstall-VMInsights.ps1to enable VM insights for multiple VMs or virtual machine scale sets. This script iterates through the machines according to the parameters that you specify. The script can be used to enable VM insights for the following. Each of these parameters accepts wildcards.
Every virtual machine and virtual machine scale set in your subscription.
The scoped resource groups specified by-ResourceGroup.
-ResourceGroup
A VM or virtual machine scale set specified by-Name.
-Name
Verify that you're using Az PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later withEnable-AzureRMcompatibility aliases enabled. RunGet-Module -ListAvailable Azto find the version. To upgrade, seeInstall Azure PowerShell module. If you're running PowerShell locally, runConnect-AzAccountto create a connection with Azure.

Check your machines in Azure portal to see if the extensions are installed or use the following command:
az vm extension list --resource-group <resource group> --vm-name <VM name>  -o table
az vm extension list --resource-group <resource group> --vm-name <VM name>  -o table
Edit VM insights configuration
To edit the VM insights configuration for a virtual machine after it's been onboarded, click onEnablednext to the VM on the VM insightsOverviewpage. This will display the current configuration. ClickEditto open the configuration page as described in the previous section. You can select another DCR for the VM or create a new one. You can't modify the existing DCR from this page.
