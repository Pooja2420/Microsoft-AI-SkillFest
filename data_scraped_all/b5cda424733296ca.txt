Internet Information Services (IIS) stores user activity in log files that can be collected by Azure Monitor agent using adata collection rule (DCR)with aIIS Logsdata source. Details for the creation of the DCR are provided inCollect data from VM client with Azure Monitor. This article provides additional details for the IIS logs data source type.
Configure IIS log data source
Create the DCR using the process inCollect data from virtual machine client with Azure Monitor. On theCollect and delivertab of the DCR, selectIIS Logsfrom theData source typedropdown. You only need to specify a file pattern to identify the directory where the log files are located if they are stored in a different location than configured in IIS. In most cases, you can leave this value blank.

Add destinations
IIS logs can only be sent to a Log Analytics workspace where it's stored in theW3CIISLogtable. Add a destination of typeAzure Monitor Logsand select a Log Analytics workspace. You can only add a single workspace to a DCR for an IIS log data source. If you need multiple destinations, create multiple DCRs. Be aware though that this will send duplicate data to each which will result in additional cost.

Verify data collection
To verify that data is being collected, check for records in theW3CIISLogtable. From the virtual machine or from the Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal, selectLogsand then click theQueriesbutton. Under theVirtual machinescategory, clickRunnext toList IIS Log entries.

Configure collection of IIS logs on client
Before you can collect IIS logs from the machine, you must ensure that IIS logging has been enabled and is configured correctly.
The IIS log file must be in W3C format and stored on the local drive of the machine running the agent.
Each entry in the log file must be delineated with an end of line.
The log file must not use circular logging, which overwrites old entries.
The log file must not use renaming, where a file is moved and a new file with the same name is opened.
The default location for IIS log files isC:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1. Verify that log files are being written to this location or check your IIS configuration to identify an alternate location. Check the timestamps of the log files to ensure that they're recent.

Note
The X-Forwarded-For custom field is not currently supported. If this is a critical field, you can collect the IIS logs as acustom text log.
Troubleshooting
Go through the following steps if you aren't collecting data from the IIS log that you're expecting.
Verify that IIS logs are being created in the location you specified.
Verify that IIS logs are configured to be W3C formatted.
SeeVerify operationto verify whether the agent is operational and data is being received.
