Apache Kafkais an open-source distributed streaming platform that can be used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications. Kafka also provides message broker functionality similar to a message queue, where you can publish and subscribe to named data streams.
The following are specific characteristics of Kafka on HDInsight:
It's a managed service that provides a simplified configuration process. The result is a configuration that is tested and supported by Microsoft.

Microsoft provides a 99.9% Service Level Agreement (SLA) on Kafka uptime. For more information, see theSLA information for HDInsightdocument.

It uses Azure Managed Disks as the backing store for Kafka. Managed Disks can provide up to 16 TB of storage per Kafka broker.

Kafka was designed with a single dimensional view of a rack. Azure separates a rack into two dimensions - Update Domains (UD) and Fault Domains (FD). Microsoft provides tools that rebalance Kafka partitions and replicas across UDs and FDs.For more information, seeHigh availability with Apache Kafka on HDInsight.

HDInsight allows you to change the number of worker nodes (which host the Kafka-broker) after cluster creation. Upward scaling can be performed from the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, and other Azure management interfaces. For Kafka, you should rebalance partition replicas after scaling operations. Rebalancing partitions allows Kafka to take advantage of the new number of worker nodes.HDInsight Kafka does not support downward scaling or decreasing the number of brokers within a cluster. If an attempt is made to decrease the number of nodes, anInvalidKafkaScaleDownRequestErrorCodeerror is returned.For more information, seeHigh availability with Apache Kafka on HDInsight.

Azure Monitor logs can be used to monitor Kafka on HDInsight. Azure Monitor logs surfaces virtual machine level information, such as disk and NIC metrics, and JMX metrics from Kafka.For more information, seeAnalyze logs for Apache Kafka on HDInsight.

Apache Kafka on HDInsight architecture
The following diagram shows a typical Kafka configuration that uses consumer groups, partitioning, and replication to offer parallel reading of events with fault tolerance:

Apache ZooKeeper manages the state of the Kafka cluster. Zookeeper is built for concurrent, resilient, and low-latency transactions.
Kafka stores records (data) intopics. Records are produced byproducers, and consumed byconsumers. Producers send records to Kafkabrokers. Each worker node in your HDInsight cluster is a Kafka broker.
Topics partition records across brokers. When consuming records, you can use up to one consumer per partition to achieve parallel processing of the data.
Replication is employed to duplicate partitions across nodes, protecting against node (broker) outages. A partition denoted with an(L)in the diagram is the leader for the given partition. Producer traffic is routed to the leader of each node, using the state managed by ZooKeeper.
