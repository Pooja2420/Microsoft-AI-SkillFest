Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure services (for example, Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over aprivate endpointin your virtual network.
A private endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.
For more information, seeWhat is Azure Private Link?
Important points
This feature is supported with thepremiumtier of Azure Service Bus. For more information about the premium tier, see theService Bus Premium and Standard messaging tiersarticle.

Implementing private endpoints can prevent other Azure services from interacting with Service Bus. As an exception, you can allow access to Service Bus resources from certaintrusted serviceseven when private endpoints are enabled.

Add a private endpoint using Azure portal
Prerequisites
To integrate a Service Bus namespace with Azure Private Link, you need the following entities or permissions:
A Service Bus namespace.
An Azure virtual network.
A subnet in the virtual network. You can use thedefaultsubnet.
Owner or contributor permissions for both the Service Bus namespace and the virtual network.
Your private endpoint and virtual network must be in the same region. When you select a region for the private endpoint using the portal, it will automatically filter only virtual networks that are in that region. Your Service Bus namespace can be in a different region. And, Your private endpoint uses a private IP address in your virtual network.
Configure private access when creating a namespace
When creating a namespace, you can either allow public only (from all networks) or private only (only via private endpoints) access to the namespace.
If you select thePrivate accessoption on theNetworkingpage of the namespace creation wizard, you can add a private endpoint on the page by selecting+ Private endpointbutton. See the next section for the detailed steps for adding a private endpoint.

Configure private access for an existing namespace
If you already have an existing namespace, you can create a private endpoint by following these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Trusted Microsoft services
When you enable theAllow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewallsetting, the following services are granted access to your Service Bus resources.
Enable system-assigned identity for a topic or a domain
Add the identity to the Azure Service Bus Data Sender role on the Service Bus namespace
Then, configure the event subscription that uses a Service Bus queue or topic as an endpoint to use the system-assigned identity.
For more information, seeEvent delivery with a managed identity
Important: The Stream Analytics job should be configured to use amanaged identityto access the Service Bus namespace. Add the identity to theAzure Service Bus Data Senderrole on the Service Bus namespace.
Enable system-assigned or user assigned managed identity for your IoT hub.
Add the identity to theAzure Service Bus Data Senderrole on the Service Bus namespace.
Configure the IoT Hub that uses a Service Bus entity as an endpoint to use the identity-based authentication.
The API Management service allows you to send messages to a Service Bus queue/topic in your Service Bus Namespace.
You can trigger custom workflows by sending messages to your Service Bus queue/topic when an API is invoked by using thesend-request policy.
You can also treat a Service Bus queue/topic as your backend in an API. For a sample policy, seeAuthenticate using a managed identity to access a Service Bus queue or topic. You also need to do the following steps:Enable system-assigned identity on the API Management instance.

Add a private endpoint using PowerShell
The following example shows you how to use Azure PowerShell to create a private endpoint connection to a Service Bus namespace.
Your private endpoint and virtual network must be in the same region. Your Service Bus namespace can be in a different region. And, Your private endpoint uses a private IP address in your virtual network.

Manage private endpoints using Azure portal
When you create a private endpoint, the connection must be approved. If the resource for which you're creating a private endpoint is in your directory, you can approve the connection request provided you have sufficient permissions. If you're connecting to an Azure resource in another directory, you must wait for the owner of that resource to approve your connection request.
There are four provisioning states:
Approve, reject, or remove a private endpoint connection
Sign in to the Azure portal.
In the search bar, type inService Bus.
Select thenamespacethat you want to manage.
Select theNetworkingtab.
See the appropriate following section based on the operation you want to: approve, reject, or remove.
Reject a private endpoint connection
If there are any private endpoint connections you want to reject, whether it's a pending request or existing connection that was approved earlier, select the endpoint connection and select theRejectbutton.
If there are any private endpoint connections you want to reject, whether it's a pending request or existing connection that was approved earlier, select the endpoint connection and select theRejectbutton.

Select theprivate endpointyou wish to approve
Select theApprovebutton on the toolbar.
On theApprove connectionpage, enter an optionalcomment, and selectYes. If you selectNo, nothing happens.
You should see the status of the connection in the list changed toApproved.
Validate that the private link connection works
You should validate that resources within the virtual network of the private endpoint are connecting to your Service Bus namespace over a private IP address, and that they have the correct private DNS zone integration.
First, create a virtual machine by following the steps inCreate a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal
In theNetworkingtab:
SpecifyVirtual networkandSubnet. You must select the Virtual Network on which you deployed the private endpoint.
Specify apublic IPresource.
ForNIC network security group, selectNone.
ForLoad balancing, selectNo.
Connect to the VM, open the command line, and run the following command:
nslookup <service-bus-namespace-name>.servicebus.windows.net
nslookup <service-bus-namespace-name>.servicebus.windows.net
You should see a result that looks like the following.
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    <service-bus-namespace-name>.privatelink.servicebus.windows.net
Address:  10.0.0.4 (private IP address associated with the private endpoint)
Aliases:  <service-bus-namespace-name>.servicebus.windows.net
Non-authoritative answer:

Address:  10.0.0.4 (private IP address associated with the private endpoint)
Aliases:  <service-bus-namespace-name>.servicebus.windows.net
Limitations and Design Considerations
For pricing information, seeAzure Private Link pricing.
This feature is available in all Azure public regions.
Maximum number of private endpoints per Service Bus namespace: 120.
The traffic is blocked at the application layer, not at the TCP layer. Therefore, you see TCP connections ornslookupoperations succeeding against the public endpoint even though the public access is disabled.
