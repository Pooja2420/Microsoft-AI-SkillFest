Learn how to add comments to wiki pages to enhance collaboration among team members.
Prerequisites
Add a comment
You can add a comment at the bottom of any wiki page. Comments get posted on a per-branch basis. For example, if you make a comment on a wiki page on the main branch, it doesn't appear in another published branch of a file of the same name. Comments get stored on the internal database. For more information, seeData locations for Azure DevOps.

When a user reacts to a comment on a wiki, an email notification gets sent to the commenter and optionally the followers. When a user adds a comment on a wiki, an email notification gets sent to all followers of the wiki regardless of who is tagged in the comment.
View Markdown and preview tabs
When you add a Markdown-based comment, there's a Markdown editor and preview tab. Use these tabs to view and change how the comment is rendered before you add it. You can also@mention users and groups. This@mentionsends an email notification to each user or group, with a link to the wiki page.

Edit or delete a comment
Edit or delete any comments that you added to a wiki. You can't edit or delete comments made by other users.
