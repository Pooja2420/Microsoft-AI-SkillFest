Azure Policy's machine configuration feature provides native capability to audit or configure
operating system settings as code for machines running in Azure and hybridArc-enabled machines. You can use the feature directly per-machine, or orchestrate it at
scale by using Azure Policy.
Configuration resources in Azure are designed as anextension resource. You can imagine each
configuration as an extra set of properties for the machine. Configurations can include settings
such as:
Operating system settings
Application configuration or presence
Environment settings
Configurations are distinct from policy definitions. Machine configuration uses Azure Policy to
dynamically assign configurations to machines. You can also assign configurations to machinesmanually.
Examples of each scenario are provided in the following table.
You can view the per-setting results from configurations in theGuest assignments page. If an
Azure Policy assignment orchestrated the configuration is orchestrated, you can select the "Last
evaluated resource" link on the"Compliance details" page.
Note
Machine Configuration currently supports the creation of up to 50 guest assignments per machine.
Enforcement Modes for Custom Policies
In order to provide greater flexibility in the enforcement and monitoring of server settings, applications and workloads, Machine Configuration offers three main enforcement modes for each policy assignment as described in the following table.
A video walk-through of this document is available. (Update coming soon)
Enable machine configuration
To manage the state of machines in your environment, including machines in Azure
and Arc-enabled servers, review the following details.
Resource provider
Before you can use the machine configuration feature of Azure Policy, you must register theMicrosoft.GuestConfigurationresource provider. If assignment of a machine configuration policy
is done through the portal, or if the subscription is enrolled in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, the
resource provider is registered automatically. You can manually register through theportal,Azure PowerShell, orAzure CLI.
Microsoft.GuestConfiguration
Deploy requirements for Azure virtual machines
To manage settings inside a machine, avirtual machine extensionis enabled and the machine
must have a system-managed identity. The extension downloads applicable machine configuration
assignments and the corresponding dependencies. The identity is used to authenticate the machine as
it reads and writes to the machine configuration service. The extension isn't required for
Arc-enabled servers because it's included in the Arc Connected Machine agent.
Important
The machine configuration extension and a managed identity are required to manage Azure virtual
machines.
To deploy the extension at scale across many machines, assign the policy initiativeDeploy prerequisites to enable Guest Configuration policies on virtual machinesto a management group, subscription, or resource group containing the machines that you plan to
manage.
Deploy prerequisites to enable Guest Configuration policies on virtual machines
If you prefer to deploy the extension and managed identity to a single machine, seeConfigure managed identities for Azure resources on a VM using the Azure portal.
To use machine configuration packages that apply configurations, Azure VM guest configuration
extension version 1.26.24 or later is required.
Important
The creation of a managed identity or assignment of a policy with "Guest Configuration
Resource Contributor" role are actions that require appropriate Azure RBAC permissions to perform.
To learn more about Azure Policy and Azure RBAC, seerole-based access control in Azure Policy.
Limits set on the extension
To limit the extension from impacting applications running inside the machine, the machine
configuration agent isn't allowed to exceed more than 5% of CPU. This limitation exists for both
built-in and custom definitions. The same is true for the machine configuration service in Arc
Connected Machine agent.
Validation tools
Inside the machine, the machine configuration agent uses local tools to perform tasks.
The following table shows a list of the local tools used on each supported operating system. For
built-in content, machine configuration handles loading these tools automatically.
Validation frequency
The machine configuration agent checks for new or changed guest assignments every 5 minutes. Once a
guest assignment is received, the settings for that configuration are rechecked on a 15-minute
interval. If multiple configurations are assigned, each is evaluated sequentially. Long-running
configurations affect the interval for all configurations, because the next can't run until the
prior configuration has finished.
Results are sent to the machine configuration service when the audit completes. When a policyevaluation triggeroccurs, the state of the machine is written to the machine configuration
resource provider. This update causes Azure Policy to evaluate the Azure Resource Manager
properties. An on-demand Azure Policy evaluation retrieves the latest value from the machine
configuration resource provider. However, it doesn't trigger a new activity within the machine. The
status is then written to Azure Resource Graph.
Supported client types
Machine configuration policy definitions are inclusive of new versions. Older versions of operating
systems available in Azure Marketplace are excluded if the Guest Configuration client isn't
compatible. Additionally, Linux server versions that are out of lifetime support by their
respective publishers are excluded from the support matrix.
The following table shows a list of supported operating systems on Azure images. The.xtext is
symbolic to represent new minor versions of Linux distributions.
.x
* Red Hat CoreOS isn't supported.
Machine configuration policy definitions support custom virtual machine images as long as they're
one of the operating systems in the previous table. Machine Configuration does not support VMSS
uniform but does supportVMSS Flex.
Network requirements
Azure virtual machines can use either their local virtual network adapter (vNIC) or Azure Private
Link to communicate with the machine configuration service.
Azure Arc-enabled machines connect using the on-premises network infrastructure to reach Azure
services and report compliance status.
The following table shows the supported endpoints for Azure and Azure Arc-enabled machines:
Communicate over virtual networks in Azure
To communicate with the machine configuration resource provider in Azure, machines require outbound
access to Azure datacenters on port443*. If a network in Azure doesn't allow outbound traffic,
configure exceptions withNetwork Security Grouprules. Theservice tagsAzureArcInfrastructureandStoragecan be used to reference the guest configuration and Storage
services rather than manually maintaining thelist of IP rangesfor Azure datacenters. Both
tags are required because Azure Storage hosts the machine configuration content packages.
443
AzureArcInfrastructure
Storage
Communicate over Private Link in Azure
Virtual machines can useprivate linkfor communication to the machine configuration service.
Apply tag with the nameEnablePrivateNetworkGCand valueTRUEto enable this feature. The tag
can be applied before or after machine configuration policy definitions are applied to the machine.
EnablePrivateNetworkGC
TRUE
Important
To communicate over private link for custom packages, the link to the location of the
package must be added to the list of allowed URLs.
Traffic is routed using the Azurevirtual public IP addressto establish a secure,
authenticated channel with Azure platform resources.
Communicate over public endpoints outside of Azure
Servers located on-premises or in other clouds can be managed with machine configuration
by connecting them toAzure Arc.
For Azure Arc-enabled servers, allow traffic using the following patterns:
Port: Only TCP 443 required for outbound internet access
Global URL:*.guestconfiguration.azure.com
*.guestconfiguration.azure.com
See theAzure Arc-enabled servers network requirementsfor a full list of all network
endpoints required by the Azure Connected Machine Agent for core Azure Arc and machine
configuration scenarios.
Communicate over Private Link outside of Azure
When you useprivate link with Arc-enabled servers, built-in policy packages are
automatically downloaded over the private link. You don't need to set any tags on the Arc-enabled
server to enable this feature.
Assigning policies to machines outside of Azure
The Audit policy definitions available for machine configuration include theMicrosoft.HybridCompute/machinesresource type. Any machines onboarded toAzure Arc-enabled serversthat are in the scope of the policy assignment are automatically
included.
Managed identity requirements
Policy definitions in the initiativeDeploy prerequisites to enable guest configuration policies on virtual machinesenable a
system-assigned managed identity, if one doesn't exist. There are two policy definitions in the
initiative that manage identity creation. Theifconditions in the policy definitions ensure the
correct behavior based on the current state of the machine resource in Azure.

if
Important
These definitions create a System-Assigned managed identity on the target resources, in addition
to existing User-Assigned Identities (if any). For existing applications unless they specify the
User-Assigned identity in the request, the machine will default to using System-Assigned Identity
instead.Learn More
If the machine doesn't currently have any managed identities, the effective policy is:Add system-assigned managed identity to enable Guest Configuration assignments on virtual machines with no identities
If the machine currently has a user-assigned system identity, the effective policy is:Add system-assigned managed identity to enable Guest Configuration assignments on VMs with a user-assigned identity
Availability
Customers designing a highly available solution should consider the redundancy planning
requirements forvirtual machinesbecause guest assignments are extensions of machine
resources in Azure. When guest assignment resources are provisioned into an Azure region that'spaired, you can view guest assignment reports if at least one region in the pair is
available. When the Azure region isn't paired and it becomes unavailable, you can't access reports
for a guest assignment. When the region is restored, you can access the reports again.
It's best practice to assign the same policy definitions with the same parameters to all machines
in the solution for highly available applications. This is especially true for scenarios where
virtual machines are provisioned inAvailability Setsbehind a load balancer solution. A
single policy assignment spanning all machines has the least administrative overhead.
For machines protected byAzure Site Recovery, ensure that the machines in the primary and
secondary site are within scope of Azure Policy assignments for the same definitions. Use the same
parameter values for both sites.
Data residency
Machine configuration stores and processes customer data. By default, customer data is replicated
to thepaired region.For the regions Singapore, Brazil South, and East Asia, all customer
data is stored and processed in the region.
Troubleshooting machine configuration
For more information about troubleshooting machine configuration, seeAzure Policy troubleshooting.
Multiple assignments
At this time, only some built-in machine configuration policy definitions support multiple
assignments. However, all custom policies support multiple assignments by default if you used the
latest version ofthe GuestConfiguration PowerShell moduleto create machine configuration
packages and policies.
Following is the list of built-in machine configuration policy definitions that support multiple
assignments:
Note
Please check this page periodically for updates to the list of built-in machine configuration
policy definitions that support multiple assignments.
Assignments to Azure management groups
Azure Policy definitions in the categoryGuest Configurationcan be assigned to management groups
when the effect isAuditIfNotExistsorDeployIfNotExists.
Guest Configuration
AuditIfNotExists
DeployIfNotExists
Important
Whenpolicy exemptionsare created on a Machine Confgiguration policy, the associated guest assignment will need to be deleted in order to stop the agent from scanning.
Client log files
The machine configuration extension writes log files to the following locations:
Windows
Azure VM:C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\gc_agent_logs\gc_agent.log
C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\gc_agent_logs\gc_agent.log
Arc-enabled server:C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\arc_policy_logs\gc_agent.log
C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\arc_policy_logs\gc_agent.log
Linux
Azure VM:/var/lib/GuestConfig/gc_agent_logs/gc_agent.log
/var/lib/GuestConfig/gc_agent_logs/gc_agent.log
Arc-enabled server:/var/lib/GuestConfig/arc_policy_logs/gc_agent.log
/var/lib/GuestConfig/arc_policy_logs/gc_agent.log
Collecting logs remotely
The first step in troubleshooting machine configurations or modules should be to use the cmdlets
following the steps inHow to test machine configuration package artifacts. If that isn't
successful, collecting client logs can help diagnose issues.
Capture information from log files usingAzure VM Run Command, the following example
PowerShell script can be helpful.
$linesToIncludeBeforeMatch = 0
$linesToIncludeAfterMatch  = 10
$params = @{
    Path = 'C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\gc_agent_logs\gc_agent.log'
    Pattern = @(
        'DSCEngine'
        'DSCManagedEngine'
    )
    CaseSensitive = $true
    Context = @(
        $linesToIncludeBeforeMatch
        $linesToIncludeAfterMatch
    )
}
Select-String @params | Select-Object -Last 10
$linesToIncludeBeforeMatch = 0
$linesToIncludeAfterMatch  = 10
$params = @{
    Path = 'C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\gc_agent_logs\gc_agent.log'
    Pattern = @(
        'DSCEngine'
        'DSCManagedEngine'
    )
    CaseSensitive = $true
    Context = @(
        $linesToIncludeBeforeMatch
        $linesToIncludeAfterMatch
    )
}
Select-String @params | Select-Object -Last 10
