The 'E' family of VM size series are one of Azure's memory-optimized VM instances. They're designed for memory-intensive workloads, such as large databases, big data analytics, and enterprise applications that require significant amounts of RAM to maintain high performance. Equipped with high memory-to-core ratios, E-series VMs support applications and services that benefit from faster data access and more efficient data processing capabilities. This makes them particularly well-suited for scenarios involving in-memory databases and extensive data processing tasks where ample memory is crucial for optimal performance.
Workloads and use cases
Memory-Intensive Workloads:E-family VMs are for workloads that demands a large memory footprint to efficiently handle tasks, such as simulations, large-scale computations in scientific research, or financial risk modeling.
Large Databases and SQL Servers:E-family VMs are ideal for hosting large relational databases like SQL Server and NoSQL databases that benefit from high memory capacities for improved performance in data processing and transaction handling.
Enterprise Applications:E-family VMs are suitable for resource-intensive enterprise applications, including large-scale ERP and CRM systems, where the availability of ample memory is crucial for managing complex transactions and user loads.
Big Data Applications:E-family VMs are effective for big data analytics applications that need to process vast amounts of data in memory to speed up analysis and insights generation.
In-Memory Computing:E-family VMs are great for in-memory databases (e.g., SAP HANA) that require large amounts of RAM to keep the entire dataset in memory, allowing for ultra-fast data processing and query responses.
Data Warehousing:E-family VMs provide the necessary resources for data warehousing solutions that handle and analyze large datasets, improving query performance and reducing response times.

Epsv6 and Epdsv6-series
Epsv6-series
Epdsv6-series
The Epsv6-series virtual machines are powered by Azureâs first-generation Cobalt 100 processor, delivering outstanding performance for memory optimized workloads. The Azure Cobalt 100 processor operates at 3.4 GHz and provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer 8 GiB of memory per vCPU and a wide range of vCPU sizes. These VMs are best suited for memory-intensive scale-out and enterprise workloads, such as relational database servers, large databases, data analytics engines, in-memory caches, and more. Epsv6-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. For more information,â¯see pricing for disks. Epsv6-series virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM. These VMs come without local disk, providing a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temporary storage.
