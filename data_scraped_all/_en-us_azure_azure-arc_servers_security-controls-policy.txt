Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policyprovides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known asbuilt-ins, for thecompliance domainsandsecurity controlsrelated to different compliance standards. This
page lists thecompliance domainsandsecurity controlsfor Azure Arc-enabled servers. You can
assign the built-ins for asecurity controlindividually to help make your Azure resources
compliant with the specific standard.
The title of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use the link in thePolicy Versioncolumn to view the source on theAzure Policy GitHub repo.
Important
Each control is associated with one or moreAzure Policydefinitions. These policies might help youassess compliancewith the control.
However, there often isn't a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such,Compliantin Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves. This doesn't ensure that you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time.
Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance definitions for these compliance standards can change over time.
