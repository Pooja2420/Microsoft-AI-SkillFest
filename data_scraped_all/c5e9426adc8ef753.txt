In this how-to guide, you learn how to register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. This process is essential for establishing a trust relationship between your application and the Microsoft identity platform. By completing this quickstart, you enable identity and access management (IAM) for your app, allowing it to securely interact with Microsoft services and APIs.

Register an application

Your app trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around. Once created, the application object can't be moved between different tenants.

Important
New app registrations are hidden to users by default. When you're ready for users to see the app on theirMy Apps pageyou can enable it. To enable the app, in the Microsoft Entra admin center navigate toEntra ID>Enterprise appsand select the app. Then on thePropertiespage, setVisible to users?toYes.
Grant admin consent (external tenants only)
Once you register your application, it gets assigned theUser.Readpermission. However, for external tenants, the customer users themselves can't consent to permissions themselves. You as the admin must consent to this permission on behalf of all the users in the tenant:
From theOverviewpage of your app registration, underManageselectAPI permissions.
SelectGrant admin consent for < tenant name >, then selectYes.
SelectRefresh, then verify thatGranted for < tenant name >appears underStatusfor the permission.
