In this quickstart, learn how to create a NAT gateway by using the Azure portal. The NAT Gateway service provides outbound connectivity for virtual machines in Azure.

Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portalwith your Azure account.
Create a NAT gateway
Before you deploy the NAT gateway resource and the other resources, a resource group is required to contain the resources deployed. In the following steps, you create a resource group, NAT gateway resource, and a public IP address. You can use one or more public IP address resources, public IP prefixes, or both.
For information about public IP prefixes and a NAT gateway, seeManage NAT gateway.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterNAT gateway. SelectNAT gatewaysin the search results.

Note
Virtual machines in a virtual network with a bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in bastion hosted virtual networks. For more information, seeDissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Test NAT gateway
In this section, you test the NAT gateway. You first discover the public IP of the NAT gateway. You then connect to the test virtual machine and verify the outbound connection through the NAT gateway.
