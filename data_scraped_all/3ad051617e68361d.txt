To unlock the full potential of vision-enabled chat models like GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and GPT-4o, it's essential to tailor the prompts to your specific needs. Here are some guidelines to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of your prompts.
Fundamentals of writing an image prompt
Contextual specificity:Adding context to the scenario at hand gives the model a better understanding of an appropriate output. This level of specificity aids in focusing on relevant aspects and avoiding extraneous details.
Task-oriented prompts:Focusing on a specific task helps the model to develop the output while taking that perspective into consideration.
Handle refusals:When the model indicates an inability to perform a task, refining the prompt can be an effective solution. More specific prompts can guide the model towards a clearer understanding and better execution of the task. Keep these tips in mind:Request explanations for generated responses to enhance transparency in the model's outputIf using a single-image prompt, place the image before the textAsk the model to describe the image in details first and complete your specific task from the description
Request explanations for generated responses to enhance transparency in the model's output
If using a single-image prompt, place the image before the text
Ask the model to describe the image in details first and complete your specific task from the description
Add examples:Add examples that represent the type of responses you're looking for
Break down requests:Try breaking down complex requests step-by-step to create manageable sub-goals
Define output format:Clearly mention the desired format for the output, such as markdown, JSON, HTML, etc. You can also suggest a specific structure, length, or specific attributes about the response.
Example prompt inputs and outputs
There are many ways to craft system prompts to tailor the output specifically to your needs. The following sample inputs and outputs showcase how adjusting your prompts can give you different results. Try out the model for yourself using these images and adjusting the system prompt in theAzure AI Foundry playground.
Contextual specificity
Context can help improve feedback from the model. For example, if you're working on image descriptions for a product catalog, ensure your prompt reflects that in a clear and concise way. A prompt like âDescribe images for an outdoor hiking product catalog, focusing on enthusiasm and professionalismâ guides the model to generate responses that are both accurate and contextually rich.
The image shows a camping setup in a forest area. There is a yellow tent, two folding camping chairsâone red and one blueâand a portable camping table. The surrounding area is densely populated with trees, indicating that the campsite is in a wooded region.
"Embark on your next outdoor adventure with our premium hiking and camping essentials! Featured here is our vibrant, spacious tent, designed to be your home away from home amidst the serenity of nature. Crafted with top-notch materials, it promises durability and comfort in any weather. Complementing the tent are our ultra-comfortable, lightweight folding chairs, available in eye-catching red and serene blue, perfect for those moments of relaxation after a day of exploration. Don't forget our sturdy, portable table, ideal for a delightful outdoor meal or a game of cards under the stars. Elevate your camping experience with our reliable products, where quality meets the great outdoors!"
Task-oriented prompts
Giving the model a specific task to follow is one way of sharpening the response. In this example, this prompt steers the model to concentrate on elements crucial for insurance assessments, thereby improving accuracy and relevancy.
The image shows a silver sedan that has been in an accident. The front end of the car is damaged, with the hood crumpled, and the bumper partially detached. The car is resting against a utility pole on the sidewalk, and there is visible smoke coming from the engine area, indicating a recent crash. The setting appears to be a residential street, as indicated by the presence of houses in the background, a neatly trimmed hedge, and a sidewalk.
In the image provided, we observe a silver sedan that has sustained significant front-end damage. The vehicle's hood is notably crumpled, and the front bumper has suffered substantial deformation, partially detaching from the chassis. The right headlamp assembly appears to be damaged or dislodged. There is also visible damage to the front grille area. The car is in contact with a utility pole, suggesting a frontal collision with the pole at a relatively low or moderate speed. Smoke is emanating from the engine compartment, suggesting potential mechanical or electrical damage that may need further inspection for a comprehensive assessment. The airbags do not appear to be deployed in this image. The vehicle will require a detailed inspection to evaluate the full extent of structural and mechanical damage for a complete insurance report.
Handling refusals
When you receive a refusal output from a model, there are several ways you can tweak input to generate a more appropriate response. Below is one example of how to handle a refusal and progress.
Sorry, I can't provide that information.
I apologize for the confusion earlier. To plan a meal based on the image provided, I would need to know the following:
The number of people dining to ensure there's enough food for everyone.
Any dietary restrictions or preferences to accommodate (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, allergies).
The occasion or type of meal being planned (e.g., casual lunch, dinner party).
Desired balance of the meal in terms of food groups and nutrition.
With this information, I could help suggest how to portion the dishes, create a balanced meal, and ensure the meal meets the needs of all diners.
Adding examples
The dog in the image appears to be a Border Collie. Border Collies are known for their intelligence, agility, and herding abilities. The average weight for a Border Collie is typically around 30-45 pounds (14-20 kilograms). As for height, Border Collies generally stand about 18-22 inches (46-56 centimeters) tall at the shoulder. These figures can vary based on the individual dog's genetics, diet, and level of activity. Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a well-proportioned body and a high level of energy.
A: Breed: Border Collie; average weight: 30-45 lbs; average height: 18-22 inches
