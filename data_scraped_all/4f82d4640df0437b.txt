Application Gateway v2 is the latest version of Application Gateway. It provides advantages over Application Gateway v1 such as performance enhancements, autoscaling, zone redundancy, and static VIPs.
Important
Deprecation of Application Gateway V1 wasannounced on April 28, 2023. If you use Application Gateway V1 SKU, start planning your migration to V2 now and complete your migration to Application Gateway v2 by April 28, 2026. The v1 service isn't supported after this date.
Key capabilities
The v2 SKU includes the following enhancements:
TCP/TLS proxy (Preview): Azure Application Gateway now also supports Layer 4 (TCP protocol) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) proxying. This feature is currently in public preview. For more information, seeApplication Gateway TCP/TLS proxy overview.

Autoscaling: Application Gateway or WAF deployments under the autoscaling SKU can scale out or in based on changing traffic load patterns. Autoscaling also removes the requirement to choose a deployment size or instance count during provisioning. This SKU offers true elasticity. In the Standard_v2 and WAF_v2 SKU, Application Gateway can operate both in fixed capacity (autoscaling disabled) and in autoscaling enabled mode. Fixed capacity mode is useful for scenarios with consistent and predictable workloads. Autoscaling mode is beneficial in applications that see variance in application traffic.

Zone redundancy: An Application Gateway or WAF deployment can span multiple Availability Zones, removing the need to provision separate Application Gateway instances in each zone with a Traffic Manager. You can choose a single zone or multiple zones where Application Gateway instances are deployed, which makes it more resilient to zone failure. The backend pool for applications can be similarly distributed across availability zones.Zone redundancy is available only where Azure availability zones are available. In other regions, all other features are supported. For more information, seeAzure regions with availability zone support.

Static VIP: Application Gateway v2 SKU supports the static VIP type exclusively. Static VIP ensures that the VIP associated with the application gateway doesn't change for the lifecycle of the deployment, even after a restart. You must use the application gateway URL for domain name routing to App Services via the application gateway, as v1 doesn't have a static VIP.

Azure Kubernetes Service Ingress Controller: The Application Gateway v2 Ingress Controller allows the Azure Application Gateway to be used as the ingress for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) known as AKS Cluster. For more information, seeWhat is Application Gateway Ingress Controller.

Private link: The v2 SKU offers private connectivity from other virtual networks in other regions and subscriptions by using private endpoints.

Note
Some of the capabilities listed here are dependent on the SKU type.
SKU types
Application Gateway v2 is available under two SKUs:
Basic(preview): The Basic SKU is designed for applications that have lower traffic and SLA requirements, and don't need advanced traffic management features. For information on how to register for the public preview of Application Gateway Basic SKU, seeRegister for the preview.
Standard_v2 SKU: The Standard_v2 SKU is designed for running production workloads and high traffic. It also includesautoscaling, which can automatically adjust the number of instances to match your traffic needs.
The following table displays a comparison between Basic and Standard_v2.

Pricing
With the v2 SKU, consumption drives the pricing model and is no longer attached to instance counts or sizes. To learn more, seeUnderstanding pricing.
Unsupported regions
Currently, the Standard_v2 and WAF_v2 SKUs aren't available in the following regions:
China East
China North
US DOD East
US DOD Central
Migrate from v1 to v2
An Azure PowerShell script is available in the PowerShell gallery to help you migrate from your v1 Application Gateway/WAF to the v2 Autoscaling SKU. This script helps you copy the configuration from your v1 gateway. Traffic migration is still your responsibility. For more information, seeMigrate Azure Application Gateway from v1 to v2.
Feature comparison between v1 SKU and v2 SKU
The following table compares the features available with each SKU.
Note
The autoscaling v2 SKU now supportsdefault health probesto automatically monitor the health of all resources in its backend pool and highlight those backend members that are considered unhealthy. The default health probe is automatically configured for backends that don't have any custom probe configuration. To learn more, seehealth probes in application gateway.
Differences from the v1 SKU
This section describes features and limitations of the v2 SKU that differ from the v1 SKU.

Unregister the preview
To unregister from the public preview of Basic SKU:
Delete all instances of Application Gateway Basic SKU from your subscription.
Run the following Azure CLI commands:
Set-AzContext -Subscription "<your subscription ID>"
Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowApplicationGatewayBasicSku -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Network"

Next steps
Depending on your requirements and environment, you can create a test Application Gateway using either the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI.
