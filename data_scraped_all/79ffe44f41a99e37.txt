Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integrated cloud workload protections allow you to detect and quickly respond to threats across hybrid and multicloud workloads. TheMicrosoft Defender for Cloudconnector allows you to ingestsecurity alerts from Defender for Cloudinto Microsoft Sentinel, so you can view, analyze, and respond to Defender alerts, and the incidents they generate, in a broader organizational threat context.
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Defender plansare enabled per subscription. While Microsoft Sentinel's legacy connector for Defender for Cloud Apps is also configured per subscription, theTenant-based Microsoft Defender for Cloudconnector, in preview, allows you to collect Defender for Cloud alerts over your entire tenant without having to enable each subscription separately. The tenant-based connector also works withDefender for Cloud's integration with Microsoft Defender XDRto ensure that all of your Defender for Cloud alerts are fully included in any incidents you receive throughMicrosoft Defender XDR incident integration.
Alert synchronization:When you connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Microsoft Sentinel, the status of security alerts that get ingested into Microsoft Sentinel is synchronized between the two services. So, for example, when an alert is closed in Defender for Cloud, that alert displays as closed in Microsoft Sentinel as well.Changing the status of an alert in Defender for Cloud won't affect the status of any Microsoft Sentinelincidentsthat contain the Microsoft Sentinel alert, only that of the alert itself.

Bi-directional alert synchronization: Enablingbi-directional syncautomatically syncs the status of original security alerts with that of the Microsoft Sentinel incidents that contain those alerts. So, for example, when a Microsoft Sentinel incident containing a security alerts is closed, the corresponding original alert is closed in Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatically.

Note
The connector does not support syncing alerts from subscriptions owned by other tenants, even when Lighthouse is enabled for those tenants.
Prerequisites
You must be using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal. When you onboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal, Defender for Cloud alerts are already ingested into Microsoft Defender XDR, and theTenant-based Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Preview)data connector isn't listed in theData connectorspage in the Defender portal. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal.If you've onboarded Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal, you'll still want to install theMicrosoft Defender for Cloudsolution to use built-in security content with Microsoft Sentinel.If you're using Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal without Microsoft Defender XDR, this procedure is still relevant for you.

When configuringcustom analytics rulesfor alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, consider the alert severity to avoid opening incidents for informational alerts.
Informational alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud don't represent a security risk on their own, and are relevant only in the context of an existing, open incident. For more information, seeSecurity alerts and incidents in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Find and analyze your data
Security alerts are stored in theSecurityAlerttable in your Log Analytics workspace. To query security alerts in Log Analytics, copy the following into your query window as a starting point:
SecurityAlert 
| where ProductName == "Azure Security Center"
SecurityAlert 
| where ProductName == "Azure Security Center"
Alert synchronizationin both directionscan take a few minutes. Changes in the status of alerts might not be displayed immediately.
See theNext stepstab in the connector page for more useful sample queries, analytics rule templates, and recommended workbooks.
