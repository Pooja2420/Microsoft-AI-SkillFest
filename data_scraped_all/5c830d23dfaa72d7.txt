After initial deployment of the Log Analytics Windows or Linux agent in Azure Monitor, you might need to reconfigure the agent, upgrade it, or remove it from the computer if it has reached the retirement stage in its lifecycle. You can easily manage these routine maintenance tasks manually or through automation, which reduces both operational error and expenses.
Important
The legacyLog Analytics agentis deprecated as of August 31, 2024. Microsoft will no longer provide any support for the Log Analytics agent. If you use the Log Analytics agent to ingest data to Azure Monitor,migrate now to Azure Monitor agent.
Upgrade the agent
Upgrade to the latest release of the Log Analytics agent for Windows and Linux manually or automatically based on your deployment scenario and the environment the VM is running in.

Upgrade the Windows agent
To update the agent on a Windows VM to the latest version not installed by using the Log Analytics VM extension, you either run from the command prompt, script, or other automation solution or use theMMASetup-<platform>.msi Setup Wizard.
To download the latest version of the Windows agent from your Log Analytics workspace:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the Azure portal, selectAll services. In the list of resources, enterLog Analytics. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. SelectLog Analytics workspaces.

Note
During the upgrade of the Log Analytics agent for Windows, it doesn't support configuring or reconfiguring a workspace to report to. To configure the agent, follow one of the supported methods listed underAdd or remove a workspace.

Upgrade the Linux agent
Upgrade from prior versions (>1.0.0-47) is supported. Performing the installation with the--upgradecommand will upgrade all components of the agent to the latest version.
--upgrade
Run the following command to upgrade the agent:
sudo sh ./omsagent-*.universal.x64.sh --upgrade
sudo sh ./omsagent-*.universal.x64.sh --upgrade
Enable auto-update for the Linux agent
We recommend that you enableAutomatic Extension Upgradeby using these commands to update the agent automatically.

Add or remove a workspace
Add or remove a workspace using the Windows agent or the Linux agent.
Windows agent
The steps in this section are necessary not only when you want to reconfigure the Windows agent to report to a different workspace or remove a workspace from its configuration, but also when you want to configure the agent to report to more than one workspace. (This practice is commonly referred to as multihoming.) Configuring the Windows agent to report to multiple workspaces can only be performed after initial setup of the agent and by using the methods described in this section.

Linux agent
The following steps demonstrate how to reconfigure the Linux agent if you decide to register it with a different workspace or to remove a workspace from its configuration.
To verify the agent is registered to a workspace, run the following command:/opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -lIt should return a status similar to the following example:Primary Workspace: <workspaceId>   Status: Onboarded(OMSAgent Running)It's important that the status also shows the agent is running. Otherwise, the following steps to reconfigure the agent won't finish successfully.
To verify the agent is registered to a workspace, run the following command:
/opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -l
/opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -l
It should return a status similar to the following example:
Primary Workspace: <workspaceId>   Status: Onboarded(OMSAgent Running)
Primary Workspace: <workspaceId>   Status: Onboarded(OMSAgent Running)
It's important that the status also shows the agent is running. Otherwise, the following steps to reconfigure the agent won't finish successfully.
If the agent is already registered with a workspace, remove the registered workspace by running the following command. Otherwise, if it isn't registered, proceed to the next step./opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -X
If the agent is already registered with a workspace, remove the registered workspace by running the following command. Otherwise, if it isn't registered, proceed to the next step.

/opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -w <workspace id> -s <shared key> [-d <top level domain>]

To verify your changes took effect, run the following command:/opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -lIt should return a status similar to the following example:Primary Workspace: <workspaceId>   Status: Onboarded(OMSAgent Running)
To verify your changes took effect, run the following command:

It should return a status similar to the following example:

Primary Workspace: <workspaceId>   Status: Onboarded(OMSAgent Running)
The agent service doesn't need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
Update proxy settings
Log Analytics Agent (MMA) doesn't use the system proxy settings. As a result, you have to pass proxy settings while you install MMA. These settings will be stored under MMA configuration (registry) on the VM. To configure the agent to communicate to the service through a proxy server orLog Analytics gatewayafter deployment, use one of the following methods to complete this task.

Perform the following steps if your Linux computers need to communicate through a proxy server or Log Analytics gateway. The proxy configuration value has the following syntax:[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]. Theproxyhostproperty accepts a fully qualified domain name or IP address of the proxy server.

Frequently asked questions
This section provides answers to common questions.
How do I stop the Log Analytics agent from communicating with Azure Monitor?
For agents connected to Log Analytics directly, open Control Panel and selectMicrosoft Monitoring Agent. Under theAzure Log Analytics (OMS)tab, remove all workspaces listed. In System Center Operations Manager, remove the computer from the Log Analytics managed computers list. Operations Manager updates the configuration of the agent to no longer report to Log Analytics.
