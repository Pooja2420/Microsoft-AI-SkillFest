Unisys ClearPath Forward OS 2200 enterprise server virtualization on Azure
This article describes how to use virtualization technologies from Unisys, a Microsoft partner, with an existing Unisys ClearPath Forward (CPF) Dorado enterprise server. Use this approach to quickly move your system to Azure without having to rewrite your application code or redesign your database. Existing code is maintained in its original form. The application screens, user interactions, and data structures behind the scenes stay the same, which eliminates the need to retrain your users.
Architecture
The followingexample source premigration architectureillustrates a typical, on-premises Unisys CPF Dorado (2200) enterprise server.

The image is divided into several sections that represent various components and their interactions. Each section uses labels and arrows to highlight the flow of data. The on-premises datacenter includes on-premises admin users and on-premises web interface users who access the system via web browsers over TLS 1.3, port 443. Solid arrows point from both user types to Unisys ClearPath Forward Dorado (Series 2200) and its components. This section is divided into several subsections. The Communications subsection includes communication standards such as IPv4, IPv6, SSL/TLS, TP0, Telnet, FTP, and sockets. The Integration middleware subsection includes three sections: loosely coupled middleware, environment integrators, and other middleware. The Operations and monitoring subsection includes the monitoring and operations server. The Printer subsystem section includes only the printer subsystem. The Application servers section contains icons that represent Batch, TIP (transaction management), and two boxes labeled Application (COBOL, C, Fortran, PLUS, MASM). The File and DBMS facilities section contains an icon for RDMS/DMS that reads Hierarchical database system, XA compliant. The final subsection is OS 2200 operating system. External printers point to the printer subsystem.

If physical tapes are in use, they're converted to virtual tapes. Tape formatting and read and write functionality are retained. The tapes are written to Azure or offline storage. Tape functionality is maintained, which eliminates the need to rewrite source code. Benefits includeAzure Blob Storageaccounts for backup of virtual tape files and faster access times because input/output operations are conducted directly against disk media.

Components
Azure Virtual Machinesis one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure provides. In this architecture, an Azure VM gives you the flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware. The VM hosts the Unisys CPF OS 2200 enterprise server and performs the same function as the on-premises physical or virtual hardware that hosts the server.

Azure Virtual Networkis a networking service and the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. In this architecture, Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources, such as VMs, to more securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Virtual Network operates like a traditional network in your datacenter but takes advantage of Azure infrastructure benefits, such as scalability, availability, and isolation.Network interface cards (NICs)enable a VM to communicate with the internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. This capability replicates the functionality of an on-premises network infrastructure. For example, you can add more NICs to the same VM, which allows the Solaris child VMs to have their own dedicated network interface device and IP address.

Alternatives
The Unisys virtualization of the OS 2200 environment provides alift and shiftapproach to transitioning to Azure. Data, processes, and application code are all maintained and transferred to Azure. Testing is minimal because all applications are carried over from the mainframe.
Other ways to transfer data and processes to Azure include:
Refactoring the application code to C# or Java by using automated tools. This solution transfers the application's capabilities while converting the code into an Azure-native format. This solution takes longer to implement and requires thorough testing to help ensure maintained functionality.

Scenario details
The Unisys enterprise servers trace their heritage to the first commercially available enterprise servers. The Unisys CPF Dorado OS 2200 system is a full-featured enterprise server operating environment. It can scale vertically to handle mission-critical workloads. You can emulate, convert, or modernize the system into Azure. Azure provides similar or improved performance characteristics and service-level agreement metrics.
A Unisys transition moves the entire Dorado system from today's hardware to Azure via a VM. The 2200 Exec OS and all processors, libraries, and data appear as they did on the physical environment. The OS requires a license from Unisys. The architecture includes support VMs, which handle functions such as virtual tapes operations, automation and workload management (OpCon), web services, and other support functions. The architecture also uses Azure storage features, including:
Azure managed disksare block-level storage volumes that Azure manages and Virtual Machines uses. The available types of disks are Azure Ultra Disks, Azure Premium SSDs, Azure Standard SSDs, and Standard HDDs. For this architecture, you should use either Premium SSDs or Ultra Disk SSDs.

This approach provides a faster transition to Azure compared to other methods. Because hardware maintenance and facility costs are reduced, there's a quick return on investment. And because the Dorado environment remains the same, there's no cost associated with retraining users and programmers.
Depending on your end goal, a transition can be the end state or a first step toward application modernization within the Dorado environment or within Azure. This approach provides a measured, planned path for updating applications and retains the investment in the existing application code. After conversion is complete, you can use other Unisys and Azure data analytic services.
