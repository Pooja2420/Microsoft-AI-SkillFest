Azure Disk Encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. It uses theBitLockerfeature of Windows to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs), and is integrated withAzure Key Vaultto help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets.
Azure Disk Encryption is zone resilient, the same way as Virtual Machines. For details, seeAzure Services that support Availability Zones.
If you useMicrosoft Defender for Cloud, you're alerted if you have VMs that aren't encrypted. The alerts show as High Severity and the recommendation is to encrypt these VMs.

Warning
If you have previously used Azure Disk Encryption with Microsoft Entra ID to encrypt a VM, you must continue use this option to encrypt your VM. SeeAzure Disk Encryption with Microsoft Entra ID (previous release)for details.
Certain recommendations might increase data, network, or compute resource usage, resulting in additional license or subscription costs. You must have a valid active Azure subscription to create resources in Azure in the supported regions.
Do not use BitLocker to manually decrypt a VM or disk that was encrypted through Azure Disk Encryption.
You can learn the fundamentals of Azure Disk Encryption for Windows in just a few minutes with theCreate and encrypt a Windows VM with Azure CLI quickstartor theCreate and encrypt a Windows VM with Azure PowerShell quickstart.
Supported VMs and operating systems
Supported VMs
Windows VMs are available in arange of sizes. Azure Disk Encryption is supported on Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs. Azure Disk Encryption is also available for VMs with premium storage.
Azure Disk Encryption is not available onBasic, A-series VMs, v6 series VMs, or on virtual machines with a less than 2 GB of memory.  For more exceptions, seeAzure Disk Encryption: Restrictions.
Supported operating systems
All versions of Windows which support BitLocker and are configured to meet the requirements of BitLocker. For more information, seeBitLocker overview.
Note
Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11 do not support an RSA 2048 bit key. For more information, seeFAQ: What size should I use for my key encryption key?
Windows Server 2012 R2 Core and Windows Server 2016 Core requires the bdehdcfg component to be installed on the VM for encryption.
Windows Server 2008 R2 requires the .NET Framework 4.5 to be installed for encryption; install it from Windows Update with the optional update Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 for Windows Server 2008 R2 x64-based systems (KB2901983).
Networking requirements
To enable Azure Disk Encryption, the VMs must meet the following network endpoint configuration requirements:
The Windows VM must be able to connect to an Azure storage endpoint that hosts the Azure extension repository and an Azure storage account that hosts the VHD files.
If your security policy limits access from Azure VMs to the Internet, you can resolve the preceding URI and configure a specific rule to allow outbound connectivity to the IPs. For more information, seeAzure Key Vault behind a firewall.
Group Policy requirements
Azure Disk Encryption uses the BitLocker external key protector for Windows VMs. For domain joined VMs, don't push any group policies that enforce TPM protectors. For information about the group policy for "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM," seeBitLocker Group Policy Reference.
BitLocker policy on domain joined virtual machines with custom group policy must include the following setting:Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information -> Allow 256-bit recovery key. Azure Disk Encryption will fail when custom group policy settings for BitLocker are incompatible. On machines that didn't have the correct policy setting, apply the new policy, and force the new policy to update (gpupdate.exe /force).  Restarting may be required.
Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) group policy features aren't compatible with Azure Disk Encryption.
Warning
Azure Disk Encryptiondoes not store recovery keys. If theInteractive logon: Machine account lockout thresholdsecurity setting is enabled, machines can only be recovered by providing a recovery key via the serial console. Instructions for ensuring the appropriate recovery policies are enabled can be found in theBitlocker recovery guide plan.
Azure Disk Encryption will fail if domain level group policy blocks the AES-CBC algorithm, which is used by BitLocker.
Encryption key storage requirements
Azure Disk Encryption requires an Azure Key Vault to control and manage disk encryption keys and secrets. Your key vault and VMs must reside in the same Azure region and subscription.
For details, seeCreating and configuring a key vault for Azure Disk Encryption.
