Harm categories
Content Safety recognizes four distinct categories of objectionable content.
Race, ethnicity, nationality
Gender identity groups and expression
Sexual orientation
Religion
Personal appearance and body size
Disability status
Harassment and bullying
Hate

Child exploitation, child abuse, child grooming
Sexual

Bullying and intimidation
Terrorist and violent extremism
Stalking
Violence

SelfHarm
Classification can be multi-labeled. For example, when a text sample goes through the text moderation model, it could be classified as both Sexual content and Violence.
Severity levels
Every harm category the service applies also comes with a severity level rating. The severity level is meant to indicate the severity of the consequences of showing the flagged content.
Text: The current version of the text model supports the full 0-7 severity scale. The classifier detects among all severities along this scale. If the user specifies, it can return severities in the trimmed scale of 0, 2, 4, and 6; each two adjacent levels are mapped to a single level.
