Availability of services across Azure regions depends on a region's type. There are two types of regions in Azure:recommendedandalternate.
Recommendedregions provide the broadest range of service capabilities and currently support availability zones. In the Azure portal, recommended regions are designated asRecommended.
Alternateregions extend Azure's footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region currently exists. Alternate regions help to optimize latency and provide a second region for disaster recovery needs but don't support availability zones. Azure conducts regular assessments of alternate regions to determine if they should become recommended regions. In the Azure portal, alternate regions are designated   asOther.
Service categories across region types
Azure services are grouped into three categories:foundational,mainstream, andstrategic. Azure's general policy on deploying services into any given region is primarily driven by region type, service categories, and customer demand.
Foundational: Available in all recommended and alternate regions when the region is generally available, or within 90 days of a new foundational service becoming generally available.
Mainstream: Available in all recommended regions within 90 days of the region general availability. Demand-driven in alternate regions, and many are already deployed into a large subset of alternate regions.
Strategic(previously Specialized): Targeted service offerings, often industry-focused or backed by customized hardware. Demand-driven availability across regions, and many are already deployed into a large subset of recommended regions.
To see which services are deployed in a region and the future roadmap for preview or general availability of services in a region, seeProducts available by region.
If a service offering isn't available in a region, contact your Microsoft sales representative for more information and to explore options.
Available services by region category
Azure assigns service categories as foundational, mainstream, and strategic at general availability. Typically, services start as a strategic service and are upgraded to mainstream and foundational as demand and use grow.
Azure services are presented in the following lists by category. Note that some services are non-regional, which means that they're available globally regardless of region. For information and a complete list of non-regional services, seeProducts available by region.
