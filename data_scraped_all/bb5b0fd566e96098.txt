This article helps you create anEnterprise Agreement (EA)subscription for yourself or for someone else in your current Microsoft Entra directory/tenant. You can create another subscription to avoid hitting subscription quota limits, to create separate environments for security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.
If you want to create subscriptions for Microsoft Customer Agreements, seeCreate a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription. If you're a Microsoft Partner and you want to create a subscription for a customer, seeCreate a subscription for a partner's customer. Or, if you have a Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) billing account, also called pay-as-you-go, you can create subscriptions starting in theAzure portaland then you complete the process athttps://signup.azure.com/.
Note
You can't provision Azure resources such as subscriptions, virtual machines, Azure web apps, or Azure functions in a Microsoft Entra B2B or Azure AD B2C tenant. You must create those resources in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

Create subscription in other tenant and view transfer requests
A user with the following permission can create subscriptions in their customer's directory if they're allowed or exempted with subscription policy. For more information, seeSetting subscription policy.
Enterprise Administrator
Account Owner
When you try to create a subscription for someone in a directory outside of the current directory (such as a customer's tenant), asubscription creation requestis created. You specify the subscription directory and subscription owner details on the Advanced tab when creating the subscription. The subscription owner must accept the subscription ownership request before the subscription is created. The subscription owner is the customer in the target tenant where the subscription is being provisioned.

When the request is created, the subscription owner (the customer) is sent an email letting them know that they need to accept subscription ownership. The email contains a link used to accept ownership in the Azure portal. The customer must accept the request within seven days. If not accepted within seven days, the request expires. The person that created the request can also manually send their customer the ownership URL to accept the subscription.
After the request is created, it's visible in the Azure portal atSubscriptions>View Requestsby the following people:
The tenant global administrator of the source tenant where the subscription provisioning request is made.
The user who made the subscription creation request for the subscription being provisioned in the other tenant.
The user who made the request to provision the subscription in a different tenant than where they make theSubscription â Alias REST APIcall instead of the Azure portal.
The subscription owner in the request who resides in the target tenant doesn't see this subscription creation request on the View requests page. Instead, they receive an email with the link to accept ownership of the subscription in the target tenant.

Anyone with access to view the request can view its details. In the request details, theAccept ownership URLis visible. You can copy it to manually share it with the subscription owner in the target tenant for subscription ownership acceptance.
