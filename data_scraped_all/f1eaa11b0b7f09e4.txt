After you create an organization or project collection, add contributors and configure policies, settings, and other options available to you. This article provides an overview of tasks to ensure you set up your organization or collection to get maximal use of your services.
Each organization is associated with one and only one collection. If you need to create another organization, seePlan your organizational structureandCreate an organization.
When you install Azure DevOps Server, you automatically create a default collection. If you need to create another project collection, seeManage project collections.
Prerequisites
Note
This article provides an overview of tasks that require membership in theProject Collection Administratorsgroup. For information on tasks performed by members of aProject Administratorsgroup, seeManage your project.
Add users to your organization
For large enterprises, connect Azure DevOps to Microsoft Entra ID and use its security groups to control user access. This way, you can sync users and groups between Microsoft Entra ID and Azure DevOps, and reduce the overhead of managing permissions and user access.
You can add users and security groups to your organization through the web portalOrganization settings > Usersinterface, regardless of the size of your enterprise. You can also assign these users and groups to one or more projects within your organization.
For large enterprises, the recommended method to manage Azure DevOps users, is to connect Azure DevOps to Active Directory (AD) and manage user access through security groups defined in AD. That way, when you add and remove users or groups from AD, you automatically add and remove these same users and groups from Azure DevOps. Typically, you should install Active Directory before installing Azure DevOps. You limit the maintenance of managing permissions and user access.
For small and large enterprises, you add users to a server instance through the web portalAccess levelsinterface. All users added to the server instance can be added to one or more projects defined within the project collection defined in the server instance.
When you add users, you specify theiraccess level, which determines the features they can use through the web portal. For more information, review these resources:

Note
If theLimit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectspreview feature is turned on the organization, users added to theProject-Scoped Usersgroup can't access projects that they aren't added to. For more information including important security-related call-outs, seeLimit user visibility for projects and more, later in this article.

Note
Even if you add a user or group to an access level, you must alsoadd them to a projectfor them to connect to a project and access features available through a supported client or the web portal.
Set up billing
Azure DevOps charges for the following services as described inPricing for Azure DevOps.
Individual services:Microsoft-hosted CI/CD parallel jobsSelf-hosted CI/CD parallel jobsStorage of Azure Artifacts feeds
Microsoft-hosted CI/CD parallel jobs

User licenses forBasicorBasic + Test Plans.
All organizations are granted five freeBasiclicenses and unlimited users withStakeholderaccess. For information on each access level, seeAbout access levels.
If your organization requires more than five contributors, then you need to set up billing. Users that have a Visual Studio subscription can be added without incurring any further billing charges. Billing is based on the access level,BasicorBasic + Test Plans, that you assign to the user. For more information, seeSet up billing.
Manage security and permissions
Permissions and security groups control access to specific tasks.
The following table lists the permissions assigned at the organization or collection level. All permissions, except forMake requests on behalf of others, are granted to members of theProject Collection Administratorsgroup. For more information, seePermissions and groups reference, Groups.

Change permissions at the organization or collection-level.
Add members to the Project Collection Administrators group
When you create an organization, you become a member of theProject Collection Administratorsgroup. This group has the authority to manage the organizationâs settings, policies, and processes. It can also create and manage all the projects and extensions in the organization.
The person who creates a project collection is automatically added as a member to theProject Collection Administratorsgroup. Members of this group have permissions to manage the settings, policies, and processes for the organization. Members can also create and manage all projects defined in the organization, and install and manage extensions.
It's always a good idea to have more than one person who has administrative privileges.Look up aProject Collection Administratorand then ask them to add you to the group.
Set security policies
Configure the security policies for your organization through theOrganization settings>Policiespage. These policies let you grant or restrict the following features:
Non-microsoft application access via OAuth
SSH authentication
Creation of public projects
Invitation of GitHub user accounts

For more information, seeChange application connection & security policies for your organization.

Limit user visibility
Warning
Consider the following limitations when using this preview feature:
The limited visibility features described in this section apply only to interactions through the web portal. With the REST APIs orazure devopsCLI commands, project members can access the restricted data.
azure devops
Users in the limited group can only select users who are explicitly added to Azure DevOps and not users who have access through Microsoft Entra group membership.
Guest users who are members in the limited group with default access in Microsoft Entra ID, can't search for users with the people picker.
Organizations and projects
By default, users added to an organization can view all organization and project information and settings. You can restrict specific users, such as Stakeholders, Microsoft Entra users, or member sof a particular security group, with theLimit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectspreview feature for the organization. Once the featuregets turned on, any user or group thatgets added to theProject-Scoped Usersgroupis restricted in the following ways:
Access is confined to only the projects to which they're explicitly added.
Views displaying lists of users, projects, billing details, usage data, and more accessed throughOrganization settingsare restricted.
The set of people or groups that appear in people-picker search selections and the ability to@mentionpeople is limited.
Identity search and selection
With Microsoft Entra ID, you can use people pickers to search for any user or group in your organization, not just the ones in your current project. People pickers support the following Azure DevOps functions:
Selection of a user identity from a work tracking identity field such asAssigned To
Selection of a user or group using@mentionin a work item discussion or rich-text field, a pull request discussion, commit comments, or changeset or shelveset comments
Selection of a user or group using@mentionfrom a wiki page
As shown in the following image, start entering a user or security group name into a people picker box until you find a match.

Users and groups who getadded to theProject-Scoped Usersgroupcan only see and select users and groups in the project they're connected to from a people picker.
Turn on the preview feature and add users to the security group
Do the following steps to turn on the preview feature and add users and group to the Project-Scoped Users group:
Turn on theLimit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectspreview featurefor the organization.

All security groups in Azure DevOps are considered organization-level entities, even if they only have permissions for a specific project. This means that security groups get managed at the organization level.
From the web portal, the visibility of some security groups might be restricted based on the user's permissions. However, you can still discover the names of all security groups within an organization by using theazure devopsCLI tool or the REST APIs. For more information, seeAdd and manage security groups.
Manage extensions
An extension is an installable unit that adds new capabilities to your projects. Azure DevOps extensions support the following functions:
Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, and so on
Build and release flows
Code testing and tracking
Collaboration among team members
For example, to supportcode search, install theCode Search extension.
You want to tell your users about extensions and that they canrequest an extension. To install and manage extensions, be an organization Owner, a member of theProject Collection Administratorsgroup. Or, you can get added to theManager role for extensions.
Install Code Search
Code Search is a free Marketplace extension that lets you search across all your source repositories. For more information, seeInstall and configure Search.
Turn on Analytics
The Analytics service is the reporting platform for Azure DevOps, replacing the previous platform based on SQL Server Reporting Services. Analytics is built for reporting and optimized for fast read-access and server-based aggregations. Use it to answer quantitative questions about the past or present state of your projects.
For more information, seeWhat is the Analytics service?andTurn on the Analytics service.
Adjust time zone and other organization settings
When you create an organization, you specify the name of your organization and select the region where your organization is hosted. The defaultTime zoneis set toUTC. You can update theTime zoneand specify a Privacy URL from theOrganization settings>Overviewpage. For more information about these settings, see the following articles:
Time zone settings and usage
Add a privacy policy URL for your organization
