An Azure container registry by default accepts connections over the internet from hosts on any network. This article shows how to configure your container registry to allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges. It provides equivalent steps using the Azure CLI and Azure portal.
IP network rules are configured on the public registry endpoint. IP network rules don't apply to private endpoints configured withPrivate Link.
Configuring IP access rules is available in thePremiumcontainer registry service tier. For information about registry service tiers and limits, seeAzure Container Registry tiers.
Each registry supports a maximum of 100 IP access rules.
Important
Some functionality may be unavailable or require more configuration in a container registry that restricts access to private endpoints, selected subnets, or IP addresses.
When public network access to a registry is disabled, registry access by certaintrusted servicesincluding Azure Security Center requires enabling a network setting to bypass the network rules.
Once the public network access is disabled, instances of certain Azure services including Azure DevOps Services are currently unable to access the container registry.
Private endpoints are not currently supported with Azure DevOps managed agents. You will need to use a self-hosted agent with network line of sight to the private endpoint.
If the registry has an approved private endpoint and public network access is disabled, repositories and tags can't be listed outside the virtual network using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or other tools.
Access from selected public network - CLI
Change default network access to registry
To limit access to a selected public network, first change the default action to deny access. Substitute the name of your registry in the followingaz acr updatecommand:
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --default-action Deny
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --default-action Deny
Add network rule to registry
Use theaz acr network-rule addcommand to add a network rule to your registry that allows access from a public IP address or range. For example, substitute the container registry's name and the public IP address of a VM in a virtual network.
az acr network-rule add \
  --name mycontainerregistry \
  --ip-address <public-IP-address>
az acr network-rule add \
  --name mycontainerregistry \
  --ip-address <public-IP-address>
Note
After adding a rule, wait a few minutes for the rule to take effect.
Access from selected public network - portal
In the portal, navigate to your container registry.
UnderSettings, selectNetworking.
On thePublic accesstab, select to allow public access fromSelected networks.
UnderFirewall, enter a public IP address, such as the public IP address of a VM in a virtual network. Or, enter an address range in CIDR notation that contains the VM's IP address.
SelectSave.

Note
After adding a rule, wait a few minutes for the rule to take effect.
Tip
Optionally, enable registry access from a local client computer or IP address range. To allow this access, you need the computer's public IPv4 address. You can find this address by searching "what is my IP address" in an internet browser. The current client IPv4 address also appears automatically when you configure firewall settings on theNetworkingpage in the portal.
Disable public network access
Optionally, disable the public endpoint on the registry. Disabling the public endpoint overrides all firewall configurations. For example, you might want to disable public access to a registry secured in a virtual network usingPrivate Link.
Note
If the registry is set up in a virtual network with aservice endpoint, disabling access to the registry's public endpoint also disables access to the registry within the virtual network.
Disable public access - CLI
To disable public access using the Azure CLI, runaz acr updateand set--public-network-enabledtofalse. Thepublic-network-enabledargument requires Azure CLI 2.6.0 or later.
--public-network-enabled
false
public-network-enabled
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --public-network-enabled false
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --public-network-enabled false
Disable public access - portal
In the portal, navigate to your container registry and selectSettings > Networking.
On thePublic accesstab, inAllow public network access, selectDisabled. Then selectSave.

Restore public network access
To re-enable the public endpoint, update the networking settings to allow public access. Enabling the public endpoint overrides all firewall configurations.
Restore public access - CLI
Runaz acr updateand set--public-network-enabledtotrue.
--public-network-enabled
true
Note
Thepublic-network-enabledargument requires Azure CLI 2.6.0 or later.
public-network-enabled
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --public-network-enabled true
az acr update --name myContainerRegistry --public-network-enabled true
Restore public access - portal
In the portal, navigate to your container registry and selectSettings > Networking.
On thePublic accesstab, inAllow public network access, selectAll networks. Then selectSave.

Troubleshoot
Access behind HTTPS proxy
If you set a public network rule or deny public access to the registry, sign ins to the registry fail from a disallowed public network. Client access from behind an HTTPS proxy also fails if you don't set an access rule for the proxy. You see an error message similar toError response from daemon: login attempt failed with status: 403 ForbiddenorLooks like you don't have access to registry.
Error response from daemon: login attempt failed with status: 403 Forbidden
Looks like you don't have access to registry
These errors can also occur if you use an HTTPS proxy that a network access rule allows, but the proxy isn't properly configured in the client environment. Check that both your Docker client and the Docker daemon are configured for proxy behavior. For details, seeHTTP/HTTPS proxyin the Docker documentation.
Access from Azure Pipelines
If you use Azure Pipelines with an Azure container registry that limits access to specific IP addresses, the pipeline might be unable to access the registry. The outbound IP address from the pipeline isn't fixed. By default, the pipeline runs jobs using a Microsoft-hostedagenton a virtual machine pool with a changing set of IP addresses.
One workaround is to change the agent used to run the pipeline from Microsoft-hosted to self-hosted. With a self-hosted agent running on aWindowsorLinuxmachine that you manage, you control the outbound IP address of the pipeline. You can add this address in a registry IP access rule.
Access from AKS
If you use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with an Azure container registry that limits access to specific IP addresses, you can't configure a fixed AKS IP address by default. The egress IP address from the AKS cluster is randomly assigned.
To allow the AKS cluster to access the registry, use one of these options:
For the Azure Basic Load Balancer, set up astatic IP addressfor the AKS cluster.
For the Azure Standard Load Balancer, see guidance tocontrol egress trafficfrom the cluster.
