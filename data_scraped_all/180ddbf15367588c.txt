Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door provides extensive logging and telemetry to help you understand how your web application firewall (WAF) is performing and the actions it takes.
The Azure Front Door WAF log is integrated withAzure Monitor. Azure Monitor enables you to track diagnostic information, including WAF alerts and logs. You can configure WAF monitoring within the Azure Front Door resource in the Azure portal under theDiagnosticstab, through infrastructure as code approaches, or by using Azure Monitor directly.
Metrics
Azure Front Door automatically records metrics to help you understand the behavior of your WAF.
To access your WAF's metrics:
Sign in to theAzure portaland go to your Azure Front Door profile.
On the leftmost pane underMonitoring, select theMetricstab.
Add theWeb Application Firewall Request Countmetric to track the number of requests that match WAF rules.
You can create custom filters based on action types and rule names. Metrics include requests with terminating actions likeBlockandAllowas well as requests where the WAF took no action. Since multiple non-terminatingLogactions can be triggered by a single request, they are excluded from this metric to avoid duplicating request counts.

JavaScript challenge (preview) metrics
To access your JavaScript challenge WAF metrics:
Add the Web Application FirewallJS Challenge Request Countmetric to track the number of requests that match JavaScript challenge WAF rules.
JS Challenge Request Count
The following filters are provided as part of this metric:
PolicyName: This is the WAF policy name
Rule: This can be any custom rule or bot rule
Action: There are four possible values for JS Challenge actionIssued:  JS Challenge is invoked the first timePassed: JS Challenge computation succeeded and an answer was receivedValid: JS Challenge validity cookie was presentBlocked: JS Challenge computation failed
Issued:  JS Challenge is invoked the first time
Passed: JS Challenge computation succeeded and an answer was received
Valid: JS Challenge validity cookie was present
Blocked: JS Challenge computation failed

Logs and diagnostics
The Azure Front Door WAF provides detailed reporting on each request and each threat that it detects. Logging is integrated with Azure's diagnostics logs and alerts by usingAzure Monitor logs.
Logs aren't enabled by default. You must explicitly enable logs. You can configure logs in the Azure portal by using theDiagnostic settingstab.
If logging is enabled and a WAF rule is triggered, any matching patterns are logged in plain text to help you analyze and debug the WAF policy behavior. You can use exclusions to fine-tune rules and exclude any data that you want to be excluded from the logs. For more information, seeWeb application firewall exclusion lists in Azure Front Door.
You can enable three types of Azure Front Door logs:
WAF logs
Access logs
Health probe logs
Activity logs are enabled by default and provide visibility into the operations performed on your Azure resources, such as configuration changes to your Azure Front Door profile.
WAF logs
The logFrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLogincludes requests that match a WAF rule.
FrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLog
The logFrontdoorWebApplicationFirewallLogincludes any request that matches a WAF rule.

The following table shows the values logged for each request.
Allowandallow: The request was allowed to continue processing.

Blockandblock: The request matched a WAF rule configured to block the request. Alternatively, theanomaly scoringthreshold was reached and the request was blocked.

Logandlog: The request matched a WAF rule configured to use theLogaction.

AnomalyScoringandlogandscore: The request matched a WAF rule. The rule contributes to theanomaly score. The request might or might not be blocked depending on other rules that run on the same request.

JS ChallengeandJSChallengeIssued: Issued due to missing/invalid challenge clearance, missing answer.The log is created when a client requests access to a web application for the first time and has not been challenged previously. This client receives the JS challenge  page and proceeds to compute the JS challenge. Upon successful computation, the client is granted the validity cookie.
JS Challenge
JSChallengeIssued
JS ChallengeandJSChallengePass:  Passed due to valid challenge answer.This log is created when a client solves the JS challenge and resubmits the request with the correct answer. In this case, Azure WAF validates the cookie and proceeds to process the remaining rules without generating another JS challenge.
JS Challenge
JSChallengePass
JS ChallengeandJSChallengeValid: Logged/passthrough due to valid challenge.This log is created when a client has previously solved a challenge. In this case, Azure WAF logs the request and proceeds to process the remaining rules.

The following example query shows the requests that the Azure Front Door WAF blocked:
AzureDiagnostics 
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.CDN" and Category == "FrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLog" 
| where action_s == "Block"
AzureDiagnostics 
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.CDN" and Category == "FrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLog" 
| where action_s == "Block"
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "FRONTDOORS" and Category == "FrontdoorWebApplicationFirewallLog"
| where action_s == "Block"
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "FRONTDOORS" and Category == "FrontdoorWebApplicationFirewallLog"
| where action_s == "Block"
The following snippet shows an example log entry, including the reason that the request was blocked:
