This article explains the following concepts related to IP addresses of function apps:
Locating the IP addresses currently in use by a function app.
Conditions that cause function app IP addresses to change.
Restricting the IP addresses that can access a function app.
Defining dedicated IP addresses for a function app.
IP addresses are associated with function apps, not with individual functions. Incoming HTTP requests can't use the inbound IP address to call individual functions; they must use the default domain name (functionappname.azurewebsites.net) or a custom domain name.
Function app inbound IP address
Each function app starts out by using a single inbound IP address. When running in a Consumption or Premium plan, additional inbound IP addresses may be added as event-driven scale-out occurs. To find the inbound IP address or addresses being used by your app, use thenslookuputility from your local computer, as in the following example:
nslookup
nslookup <APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net
nslookup <APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net
In this example, replace<APP_NAME>with your function app name. If your app uses acustom domain name, usenslookupfor that custom domain name instead.
<APP_NAME>
nslookup
Function app outbound IP addresses
Each function app has a set of available outbound IP addresses. Any outbound connection from a function, such as to a back-end database, uses one of the available outbound IP addresses as the origin IP address. You can't know beforehand which IP address a given connection will use. For this reason, your back-end service must open its firewall to all of the function app's outbound IP addresses.
Tip
For some platform-level features such asKey Vault references, the origin IP might not be one of the outbound IPs, and you should not configure the target resource to rely on these specific addresses. It is recommended that the app instead use a virtual network integration, as the platform will route traffic to the target resource through that network.
To find the outbound IP addresses available to a function app:
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Sign in to theAzure Resource Explorer.
Selectsubscriptions > {your subscription} > providers > Microsoft.Web > sites.
In the JSON panel, find the site with anidproperty that ends in the name of your function app.

Note
When a function app that runs on theConsumption planor thePremium planis scaled, a new range of outbound IP addresses may be assigned. When running on either of these plans, you can't rely on the reported outbound IP addresses to create a definitive allowlist. To be able to include all potential outbound addresses used during dynamic scaling, you'll need to add the entire data center to your allowlist.
Data center outbound IP addresses
If you need to add the outbound IP addresses used by your function apps to an allowlist, another option is to add the function apps' data center (Azure region) to an allowlist. You candownload a JSON file that lists IP addresses for all Azure data centers. Then find the JSON fragment that applies to the region that your function app runs in.
For example, the following JSON fragment is what the allowlist for Western Europe might look like:
{
  "name": "AzureCloud.westeurope",
  "id": "AzureCloud.westeurope",
  "properties": {
    "changeNumber": 9,
    "region": "westeurope",
    "platform": "Azure",
    "systemService": "",
    "addressPrefixes": [
      "13.69.0.0/17",
      "13.73.128.0/18",
      ... Some IP addresses not shown here
     "213.199.180.192/27",
     "213.199.183.0/24"
    ]
  }
}
{
  "name": "AzureCloud.westeurope",
  "id": "AzureCloud.westeurope",
  "properties": {
    "changeNumber": 9,
    "region": "westeurope",
    "platform": "Azure",
    "systemService": "",
    "addressPrefixes": [
      "13.69.0.0/17",
      "13.73.128.0/18",
      ... Some IP addresses not shown here
     "213.199.180.192/27",
     "213.199.183.0/24"
    ]
  }
}

Inbound IP address changes
The inbound IP addressmightchange when you:
Delete a function app and recreate it in a different resource group.
Delete the last function app in a resource group and region combination, and re-create it.
Delete a TLS binding, such as duringcertificate renewal.
When your function app runs in aConsumption planor in aPremium plan, the inbound IP address might also change even when you haven't taken any actions such as the oneslisted above.
Outbound IP address changes
The relative stability of the outbound IP address depends on the hosting plan.
Consumption and Premium plans
Because of autoscaling behaviors, the outbound IP can change at any time when running on aConsumption planor in aPremium plan.
If you need to control the outbound IP address of your function app, such as when you need to add it to an allow list, consider implementing avirtual network NAT gatewaywhile running in a Premium hosting plan. You can also do this by running in a Dedicated (App Service) plan.
Dedicated plans
When running on Dedicated (App Service) plans, the set of available outbound IP addresses for a function app might change when you:
Take any action that can change the inbound IP address.
Change your Dedicated (App Service) plan pricing tier. The list of all possible outbound IP addresses your app can use, for all pricing tiers, is in thepossibleOutboundIPAddressesproperty. SeeFind outbound IPs.
possibleOutboundIPAddresses
Use the following procedure to deliberately force an outbound IP address change in a Dedicated (App Service) plan:
Scale your App Service plan up or down between Standard and Premium v2 pricing tiers.
Scale your App Service plan up or down between Standard and Premium v2 pricing tiers.
Wait 10 minutes.
Wait 10 minutes.
Scale back to where you started.
Scale back to where you started.
IP address restrictions
You can configure a list of IP addresses that you want to allow or deny access to a function app. For more information, seeAzure App Service Static IP Restrictions.
Dedicated IP addresses
There are several strategies to explore when your function app requires static, dedicated IP addresses.
Virtual network NAT gateway for outbound static IP
You can control the IP address of outbound traffic from your functions by using a virtual network NAT gateway to direct traffic through a static public IP address. You can use this topology when running in aPremium planor in aDedicated (App Service) plan. To learn more, seeTutorial: Control Azure Functions outbound IP with an Azure virtual network NAT gateway.
App Service Environments
For full control over the IP addresses, both inbound and outbound, we recommendApp Service Environments(theIsolated tierof App Service plans). For more information, seeApp Service Environment IP addressesandHow to control inbound traffic to an App Service Environment.
To find out if your function app runs in an App Service Environment:
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Navigate to the function app.
Select theOverviewtab.
The App Service plan tier appears underApp Service plan/pricing tier. The App Service Environment pricing tier isIsolated.
az resource show --resource-group <GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites --query properties.sku --output tsv
az resource show --resource-group <GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites --query properties.sku --output tsv
$functionApp = Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName <GROUP_NAME> -ResourceName <APP_NAME> -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites
