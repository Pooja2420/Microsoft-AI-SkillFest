You can use the Azure portal to find performance recommendations that can optimize performance of your database in Azure SQL Database or to correct some issue identified in your workload. ThePerformance recommendationpage in the Azure portal enables you to find the top recommendations based on their potential impact.
Viewing recommendations
To view and apply performance recommendations, you need the correctAzure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)permissions in Azure.Reader,SQL DB Contributorpermissions are required to view recommendations, andOwner,SQL DB Contributorpermissions are required to execute any actions; create or drop indexes and cancel index creation.
Use the following steps to find performance recommendations on the Azure portal:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Go toAll services>SQL databases, and select your database.
Navigate toPerformance recommendationto view available recommendations for the selected database.
Performance recommendations are shown in the table similar to the one shown on the following figure:

Recommendations are sorted by their potential impact on performance into the following categories:
Note
Azure SQL Database needs to monitor activities at least for a day in order to identify some recommendations. The Azure SQL Database can more easily optimize for consistent query patterns than it can for random spotty bursts of activity. If recommendations are not currently available, thePerformance recommendationpage provides a message explaining why.
You can also view the status of the historical operations. Select a recommendation or status to see more information.
Here is an example of the "Create index" recommendation in the Azure portal.

Applying recommendations
Azure SQL Database gives you full control over how recommendations are enabled using any of the following three options:
Apply individual recommendations one at a time.
Enable the Automatic tuning to automatically apply recommendations.
To implement a recommendation manually, run the recommended T-SQL script against your database.
Select any recommendation to view its details and then clickView scriptto review the exact details of how the recommendation is created.
The database remains online while the recommendation is applied -- using performance recommendation or automatic tuning never takes a database offline.
Apply an individual recommendation
You can review and accept recommendations one at a time.
On theRecommendationspage, select a recommendation.
On theRecommendationspage, select a recommendation.
On theDetailspage, click theApplybutton.
On theDetailspage, click theApplybutton.

Selected recommendations are applied on the database.
Removing recommendations from the list
If your list of recommendations contains items that you want to remove from the list, you can discard the recommendation:
Select a recommendation in the list ofRecommendationsto open the details.
ClickDiscardon theDetailspage.
If desired, you can add discarded items back to theRecommendationslist:
On theRecommendationspage, clickView discarded.
Select a discarded item from the list to view its details.
Optionally, clickUndo Discardto add the index back to the main list ofRecommendations.
Note
Please note that if SQL DatabaseAutomatic tuningis enabled, and if you have manually discarded a recommendation from the list, such recommendation will never be applied automatically. Discarding a recommendation is a handy way for users to have Automatic tuning enabled in cases when requiring that a specific recommendation shouldn't be applied.
You can revert this behavior by adding discarded recommendations back to the Recommendations list by selecting the Undo Discard option.
Enable automatic tuning
You can set your database to implement recommendations automatically. As recommendations become available, they are automatically applied. As with all recommendations managed by the service, if the performance impact is negative, the recommendation is reverted.
On theRecommendationspage, clickAutomate:
On theRecommendationspage, clickAutomate:

Select actions to automate:
Select actions to automate:

Note
Please note thatDROP_INDEXoption is currently not compatible with applications using partition switching and index hints.
Once you have selected your desired configuration, click Apply.
Manually apply recommendations through T-SQL
Select any recommendation and then clickView script. Run this script against your database to manually apply the recommendation.
Indexes that are manually executed are not monitored and validated for performance impact by the serviceso it is suggested that you monitor these indexes after creation to verify they provide performance gains and adjust or delete them if necessary. For details about creating indexes, seeCREATE INDEX (Transact-SQL). In addition, manually applied recommendations will remain active and shown in the list of recommendations for 24-48 hrs. before the system automatically withdraws them. If you would like to remove a recommendation sooner, you can manually discard it.
Canceling recommendations
Recommendations that are in aPending,Validating, orSuccessstatus can be canceled. Recommendations with a status ofExecutingcannot be canceled.
Select a recommendation in theTuning Historyarea to open therecommendations detailspage.
ClickCancelto abort the process of applying the recommendation.
Monitoring operations
Applying a recommendation might not happen instantaneously. The portal provides details regarding the status of recommendation. The following are possible states that an index can be in:
Click an in-process recommendation from the list to see more information:

Reverting a recommendation
If you used the performance recommendations to apply the recommendation (meaning you did not manually run the T-SQL script), it automatically reverts the change if it finds the performance impact to be negative. If for any reason you simply want to revert a recommendation, you can do the following:
Select a successfully applied recommendation in theTuning historyarea.
ClickReverton therecommendation detailspage.

Monitoring performance impact of index recommendations
After recommendations are successfully implemented (currently, index operations and parameterize queries recommendations only), you can clickQuery Insightson the recommendation details page to openQuery Performance Insightsand see the performance impact of your top queries.

Summary
Azure SQL Database provides recommendations for improving database performance. By providing T-SQL scripts, you get assistance in optimizing your database and ultimately improving query performance.
Next steps
Monitor your recommendations and continue to apply them to refine performance. Database workloads are dynamic and change continuously. Azure SQL Database continues to monitor and provide recommendations that can potentially improve your database's performance.
