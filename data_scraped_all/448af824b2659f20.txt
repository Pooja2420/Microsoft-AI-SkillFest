Azure virtual machines (VMs) can be created through the Azure portal. The Azure portal is a browser-based user interface to create Azure resources. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure portal to deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS. To see your VM in action, you also SSH to the VM and install the NGINX web server.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.

Connect to virtual machine
Create anSSH connectionwith the VM.
If you are on a Mac or Linux machine, open a Bash prompt and set read-only permission on the .pem file usingchmod 400 ~/Downloads/myKey.pem. If you are on a Windows machine, open a PowerShell prompt.

chmod 400 ~/Downloads/myKey.pem
At your prompt, open an SSH connection to your virtual machine. Replace the IP address with the one from your VM, and replace the path to the.pemwith the path to where the key file was downloaded.

Tip
The SSH key you created can be used the next time your create a VM in Azure. Just select theUse a key stored in AzureforSSH public key sourcethe next time you create a VM. You already have the private key on your computer, so you won't need to download anything.
Install web server
To see your VM in action, install the NGINX web server. From your SSH session, update your package sources and then install the latest NGINX package.
Ubuntu
SUSE Linux (SLES)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
sudo zypper --non-interactive update
sudo zypper --non-interactive install nginx
sudo zypper --non-interactive update
sudo zypper --non-interactive install nginx
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install nginx
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install nginx
When done, typeexitto leave the SSH session.
exit
View the web server in action
Use a web browser of your choice to view the default NGINX welcome page. Type the public IP address of the VM as the web address. The public IP address can be found on the VM overview page or as part of the SSH connection string you used earlier.

Clean up resources
Delete resources
When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources.
On the Overview page for the VM, select theResource grouplink.
At the top of the page for the resource group, selectDelete resource group.
A page will open warning you that you are about to delete resources. Type the name of the resource group and selectDeleteto finish deleting the resources and the resource group.
Auto-shutdown
If the VM is still needed, Azure provides an Auto-shutdown feature for virtual machines to help manage costs and ensure you are not billed for unused resources.
On theOperationssection for the VM, select theAuto-shutdownoption.
A page will open where you can configure the auto-shutdown time. Select theOnoption to enable and then set a time that works for you.
Once you have set the time, selectSaveat the top to enable your Auto-shutdown configuration.
Note
Remember to configure the time zone correctly to match your requirements, as (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time is the default setting in the Time zone dropdown.
For more information seeAuto-shutdown.
Next steps
In this quickstart, you deployed a virtual machine, created a Network Security Group and rule, and installed a basic web server.
