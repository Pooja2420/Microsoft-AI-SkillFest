When an Azure resource is determined to be non-compliant to a policy rule, it's helpful to
understand which portion of the rule the resource isn't compliant with. It's also useful to
understand which change altered a previously compliant resource to make it non-compliant. There are
two ways to find this information:
Compliance details
Change history (Preview)
Compliance details
When a resource is non-compliant, the compliance details for that resource are available from thePolicy compliancepage. The compliance details pane includes the following information:
Resource details such as name, type, location, and resource ID.
Compliance state and timestamp of the last evaluation for the current policy assignment.
A list of reasons for the resource non-compliance.
Important
As the compliance details for aNon-compliantresource shows the current value of properties on
that resource, the user must havereadoperation to thetypeof resource. For example, if
theNon-compliantresource isMicrosoft.Compute/virtualMachinesthen the user must have theMicrosoft.Compute/virtualMachines/readoperation. If the user doesn't have the needed
operation, an access error is displayed.
Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read
To view the compliance details, follow these steps:
Launch the Azure Policy service in the Azure portal by selectingAll services, then searching
for and selectingPolicy.
Launch the Azure Policy service in the Azure portal by selectingAll services, then searching

On theOvervieworCompliancepage, select a policy in acompliance statethat isNon-compliant.
On theOvervieworCompliancepage, select a policy in acompliance statethat isNon-compliant.
From theResource compliancetab of thePolicy compliancepage, select and hold (or
right-click) or select the ellipsis of a resource in acompliance statethat'sNon-compliant. Then selectView compliance details.

TheCompliance detailspane displays information from the latest evaluation of the resource
to the current policy assignment. In this example, the fieldMicrosoft.Sql/servers/versionis
found to be12.0while the policy definition expected14.0. If the resource is non-compliant
for multiple reasons, each is listed on this pane.For anauditIfNotExistsordeployIfNotExistspolicy definition, the details include thedetails.typeproperty and any optional properties. For a list, seeauditIfNotExists

properties.Last evaluated resourceis
a related resource from thedetailssection of the definition.Example partialdeployIfNotExistsdefinition:{

    "field": "type",
    "equals": "[parameters('resourceType')]"
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deployIfNotExists",

      },
      "existenceScope": "subscription",
      "deployment": {
        ...
      }
    }
  }

}

Note
To protect data, when a property value is asecretthe current value displays asterisks.
These details explain why a resource is currently non-compliant, but don't show when the change was
made to the resource that caused it to become non-compliant. For that information, seeChange
history (Preview).
Compliance reasons
Resource Manager modesandResource Provider modeseach have
differentreasonsfor non-compliance.
The following table maps eachResource Manager modereasonto the
responsibleconditionin the policy definition:
then.details.type
The following table maps eachMicrosoft.PolicyInsightsResource Provider modereason code to
its corresponding explanation:
Microsoft.PolicyInsights
The following table maps eachMicrosoft.Kubernetes.DataResource Provider modereasonto
the responsible state of theconstraint templatein the policy definition:
Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data
Note
For existing policy assignments and constraint templates already on the cluster, if that
Constraint/Template fails, the cluster is protected by maintaining the existing
Constraint/Template. The cluster reports as non-compliant until the failure is resolved on the
policy assignment or the add-on self-heals. For more information about handling conflict, seeConstraint template conflicts.
Component details for Resource Provider modes
For assignments with a Resource Provider mode, select theNon-compliantresource to view its component compliance records. TheComponent Compliancetab shows more information specific to theResource Provider modelikeComponent Name,Component ID, andType.

Compliance details for guest configuration
For policy definitions in theGuest Configurationcategory, there could be multiple
settings evaluated inside the virtual machine and you need to view per-setting details. For
example, if you're auditing for a list of security settings and only one of them has statusNon-compliant, you need to know which specific settings are out of compliance and why.
You also might not have access to sign in to the virtual machine directly but you need to report on
why the virtual machine isNon-compliant.
Azure portal
Begin by following the same steps in theCompliance detailssection to view policy compliance details.
In the Compliance details pane view, select the linkLast evaluated resource.

TheGuest Assignmentpage displays all available compliance details. Each row in the view
represents an evaluation that was performed inside the machine. In theReasoncolumn, a phrase
is shown describing why the Guest Assignment isNon-compliant. For example, if you're auditing
password policies, theReasoncolumn would display text including the current value for each
setting.

View configuration assignment details at scale
The guest configuration feature can be used outside of Azure Policy assignments.
For example,Azure Automanagecreates guest configuration assignments, or you mightassign configurations when you deploy machines.
To view all guest configuration assignments across your tenant, from the Azure
portal open theGuest Assignmentspage. To view detailed compliance
information, select each assignment using the link in the columnName.

Change history (Preview)
As part of a newpublic preview, the last 14 days of change history are available for all Azure
resources that supportcomplete mode
deletion. Change history
provides details about when a change was detected and avisual difffor each change. A change
detection is triggered when the Azure Resource Manager properties are added, removed, or altered.
