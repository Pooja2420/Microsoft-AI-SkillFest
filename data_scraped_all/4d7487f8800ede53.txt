Azure Key Vault logging

After you create one or more key vaults, you'll likely want to monitor how and when your key vaults are accessed, and by whom. Enabling logging for Azure Key Vault saves this information in an Azure storage account that you provide. For step by step guidance, seeHow to enable Key Vault logging.
You can access your logging information 10 minutes (at most) after the key vault operation. In most cases, it will be quicker.  It's up to you to manage your logs in your storage account:
Use standard Azure access control methods in your storage account to secure your logs by restricting who can access them.
Delete logs that you no longer want to keep in your storage account.
For overview information about Key Vault, seeWhat is Azure Key Vault?. For information about where Key Vault is available, see thepricing page. For information about usingAzure Monitor for Key Vault.
Interpret your Key Vault logs
When you enable logging, a new container calledinsights-logs-auditeventis automatically created for your specified storage account. You can use this same storage account for collecting logs for multiple key vaults.
Individual blobs are stored as text, formatted as a JSON blob. Let's look at an example log entry.

Use Azure Monitor logs
You can use the Key Vault solution in Azure Monitor logs to review Key VaultAuditEventlogs. In Azure Monitor logs, you use log queries to analyze data and get the information you need.
