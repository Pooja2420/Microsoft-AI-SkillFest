In this article, you will learn the differences betweenAzure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandraand theRU-basedAzure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra. This article provides recommendations on how to choose between the two services, or when to host your own Apache Cassandra environment.
Key differences
Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is a fully managed service for pure open-source Apache Cassandra clusters. The service also allows configurations to be overridden, depending on the specific needs of each workload, allowing maximum flexibility and control where needed. It also provides the capability to scale out the capacity of existing on-premises or cloud self-hosted Apache Cassandra clusters. It scales out by adding managed Cassandra datacenters to the existing cluster ring.
The RU-basedAzure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandrain Azure Cosmos DB is a compatibility layer over Microsoft's globally distributed cloud-native database serviceAzure Cosmos DB.
