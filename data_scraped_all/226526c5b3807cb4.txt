This quickstart shows you how to get started with Azure Batch by using the Azure portal. You create a Batch account that has a pool of virtual machines (VMs), or compute nodes. You then create and run a job with tasks that run on the pool nodes.
After you complete this quickstart, you understand thekey concepts of the Batch serviceand are ready to use Batch with more realistic, larger scale workloads.
Prerequisites
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.
Note
For some regions and subscription types, quota restrictions might cause Batch account or node creation to fail or not complete. In this situation, you can request a quota increase at no charge. For more information, seeBatch service quotas and limits.

Create a Batch account and Azure Storage account
You need a Batch account to create pools and jobs. The following steps create an example Batch account. You also create an Azure Storage account to link to your Batch account. Although this quickstart doesn't use the storage account, most real-world Batch workloads use a linked storage account to deploy applications and store input and output data.
Sign in to theAzure portal, and search for and selectbatch accounts.

On theBatch accountspage, selectCreate.
On theBatch accountspage, selectCreate.
On theNew Batch accountpage, enter or select the following values:UnderResource group, selectCreate new, enter the nameqsBatch, and then selectOK. The resource group is a logical container that holds the Azure resources for this quickstart.ForAccount name, enter the namemybatchaccount. The Batch account name must be unique within the Azure region you select, can contain only lowercase letters and numbers, and must be between 3-24 characters.ForLocation, selectEast US.UnderStorage account, select the link toSelect a storage account.

Create a pool of compute nodes
Next, create a pool of Windows compute nodes in your Batch account. The following steps create a pool that consists of two Standard_A1_v2 size VMs running Windows Server 2019. This node size offers a good balance of performance versus cost for this quickstart.
On your Batch account page, selectPoolsfrom the left navigation.
On your Batch account page, selectPoolsfrom the left navigation.
On thePoolspage, selectAdd.
On thePoolspage, selectAdd.
On theAdd poolpage, forName, entermyPool.
On theAdd poolpage, forName, entermyPool.

UnderScale, forTarget dedicated nodes, enter2.

Accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and selectOKat the bottom of the page.
Batch creates the pool immediately, but takes a few minutes to allocate and start the compute nodes. On thePoolspage, you can selectmyPoolto go to themyPoolpage and see the pool status ofResizingunderEssentials>Allocation state. You can proceed to create a job and tasks while the pool state is stillResizingorStarting.
After a few minutes, theAllocation statechanges toSteady, and the nodes start. To check the state of the nodes, selectNodesin themyPoolpage left navigation. When a node's state isIdle, it's ready to run tasks.
Create a job
Now create a job to run on the pool. A Batch job is a logical group of one or more tasks. The job includes settings common to the tasks, such as priority and the pool to run tasks on. The job doesn't have tasks until you create them.
On themybatchaccountpage, selectJobsfrom the left navigation.
On themybatchaccountpage, selectJobsfrom the left navigation.
On theJobspage, selectAdd.
On theJobspage, selectAdd.
On theAdd jobpage, forJob ID, entermyJob.
On theAdd jobpage, forJob ID, entermyJob.
SelectSelect pool, and on theSelect poolpage, selectmyPool, and then selectSelect.
SelectSelect pool, and on theSelect poolpage, selectmyPool, and then selectSelect.
On theAdd jobpage, selectOK. Batch creates the job and lists it on theJobspage.
On theAdd jobpage, selectOK. Batch creates the job and lists it on theJobspage.
Create tasks
Jobs can contain multiple tasks that Batch queues and distributes to run on the compute nodes. Batch provides several ways to deploy apps and scripts to compute nodes. When you create a task, you specify your app or script in a command line.
The following procedure creates and runs two identical tasks in your job. Each task runs a command line that displays the Batch environment variables on the compute node, and then waits 90 seconds.
On theJobspage, selectmyJob.
On theJobspage, selectmyJob.
On theTaskspage, selectAdd.
On theTaskspage, selectAdd.
On theAdd taskpage, forTask ID, entermyTask1.
On theAdd taskpage, forTask ID, entermyTask1.
InCommand line, entercmd /c "set AZ_BATCH & timeout /t 90 > NUL".
InCommand line, entercmd /c "set AZ_BATCH & timeout /t 90 > NUL".
cmd /c "set AZ_BATCH & timeout /t 90 > NUL"
Accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and selectSubmit.
Accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and selectSubmit.
Repeat the preceding steps to create a second task, but entermyTask2forTask ID.
Repeat the preceding steps to create a second task, but entermyTask2forTask ID.
After you create each task, Batch queues it to run on the pool. Once a node is available, the task runs on the node. In the quickstart example, if the first task is still running on one node, Batch starts the second task on the other node in the pool.
View task output
The tasks should complete in a couple of minutes. To update task status, selectRefreshat the top of theTaskspage.
To view the output of a completed task, you can select the task from theTaskspage. On themyTask1page, select thestdout.txtfile to view the standard output of the task.

The contents of thestdout.txtfile are similar to the following example:

The standard output for this task shows the Azure Batch environment variables that are set on the node. As long as this node exists, you can refer to these environment variables in Batch job task command lines, and in the apps and scripts the command lines run.
Clean up resources
If you want to continue with Batch tutorials and samples, you can use the Batch account and linked storage account that you created in this quickstart. There's no charge for the Batch account itself.
Pools and nodes incur charges while the nodes are running, even if they aren't running jobs. When you no longer need a pool, delete it.
To delete a pool:
On your Batch account page, selectPoolsfrom the left navigation.
On thePoolspage, select the pool to delete, and then selectDelete.
On theDelete poolscreen, enter the name of the pool, and then selectDelete.
Deleting a pool deletes all task output on the nodes, and the nodes themselves.
When you no longer need any of the resources you created for this quickstart, you can delete the resource group and all its resources, including the storage account, Batch account, and node pools. To delete the resource group, selectDelete resource groupat the top of theqsBatchresource group page. On theDelete a resource groupscreen, enter the resource group nameqsBatch, and then selectDelete.
Next steps
In this quickstart, you created a Batch account and pool, and created and ran a Batch job and tasks. You monitored node and task status, and viewed task output from the nodes.
Now that you understand the key concepts of the Batch service, you're ready to use Batch with more realistic, larger scale workloads. To learn more about Azure Batch, continue to the Azure Batch tutorials.
