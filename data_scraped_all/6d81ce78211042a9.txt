Azure Policylets you set and enforce requirements for all new resources you create and resources you modify. VM insights policy initiatives, which are predefined sets of policies created for VM insights, install the agents required for VM insights and enable monitoring on all new virtual machines in your Azure environment.
This article explains how to enable VM insights for Azure virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and hybrid virtual machines connected with Azure Arc by using predefined VM insights policy initiates.
Prerequisites
Before you can enable VM insights using Azure Policy, you need to have a VM insights DCR created. The DCR specifies what data to collect from the agent and how it should be processed. SeeVM insights DCRfor details on creating this DCR.
VM insights initiatives
VM insights policy initiatives install Azure Monitor Agent and the Dependency agent on new virtual machines in your Azure environment. Assign these initiatives to a management group, subscription, or resource group to install the agents on Windows or Linux Azure virtual machines in the defined scope automatically.
Note
The VM Insights initiatives listed below don't update a Dependency Agent extension that already exists on your VM with Azure Monitoring Agent settings. Make sure to uninstall the Dependency Agent extension from your VM before deploying these initiatives.
Enable Azure Monitor for VMs with Azure Monitoring Agent
Enable Azure Monitor for virtual machine scale sets with Azure Monitoring Agent
Enable Azure Monitor for Hybrid VMs with Azure Monitoring Agent
The initiatives apply to new machines you create and machines you modify, but not to existing VMs.
Important
The legacyLog Analytics agentis deprecated as of August 31, 2024. Microsoft will no longer provide any support for the Log Analytics agent. If you use the Log Analytics agent to ingest data to Azure Monitor,migrate now to Azure Monitor agent.
Support for custom images
Azure Monitor Agent-based VM insights policy and initiative definitions have ascopeToSupportedImagesparameter that's set totrueby default to enable onboarding Dependency Agent on supported images only. Set this parameter tofalseto allow onboarding Dependency Agent on custom images.

Assign a VM insights policy initiative
To assign a VM insights policy initiative to a subscription or management group from the Azure portal:
Search for and openPolicy.
Search for and openPolicy.
SelectAssignments>Assign initiative.TheAssign initiativescreen appears.
SelectAssignments>Assign initiative.

TheAssign initiativescreen appears.

Configure the initiative assignment:In theScopefield, select the management group or subscription to which you'll assign the initiative.(Optional) SelectExclusionsto exclude specific resources from the initiative assignment. For example, if your scope is a management group, you might specify a subscription in that management group to be excluded from the assignment.Select the ellipsis (...) next toInitiative assignmentto start the policy definition picker. Select one of the VM insights initiatives.(Optional) Change theAssignment nameand add aDescription.On theParameterstab, select aLog Analytics workspaceto which all virtual machines in the assignment will send data. For virtual machines to send data to different workspaces, create multiple assignments, each with their own scope.  This step will have different parameters depending on which Policy Initiative you are working with at the time.NoteIf you select a workspace that's not within the scope of the assignment, grantLog Analytics Contributorpermissions to the policy assignment's principal ID. Otherwise, you might get a deployment failure like:The client 'aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb' with object id 'aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb' does not have authorization to perform action 'microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/read' over scope ...

Review compliance for a VM insights policy initiative
After you assign an initiative, you can review and manage compliance for the initiative across your management groups and subscriptions.
To see how many virtual machines exist in each of the management groups or subscriptions and their compliance status:
Search for and openAzure Monitor.
Search for and openAzure Monitor.
SelectVirtual machines>Overview>Other onboarding options. Then underEnable using policy, selectEnable.TheAzure Monitor for VMs Policy Coveragepage appears.
SelectVirtual machines>Overview>Other onboarding options. Then underEnable using policy, selectEnable.

TheAzure Monitor for VMs Policy Coveragepage appears.

The following table describes the compliance information presented on theAzure Monitor for VMs Policy Coveragepage.
Select the ellipsis (...) >View Compliance.TheCompliancepage appears. It lists assignments that match the specified filter and indicates whether they're compliant.
Select the ellipsis (...) >View Compliance.

TheCompliancepage appears. It lists assignments that match the specified filter and indicates whether they're compliant.

Select an assignment to view its details. TheInitiative compliancepage appears. It lists the policy definitions in the initiative and whether each is in compliance.Policy definitions are considered noncompliant if:Azure Monitor Agent, the Log Analytics agent, or the Dependency agent aren't deployed. Create a remediation task to mitigate.VM image (OS) isn't identified in the policy definition. Policies can only verify well-known Azure VM images. Check the documentation to see whether the VM OS is supported.Some VMs in the initiative scope are connected to a Log Analytics workspace other than the one that's specified in the policy assignment.

Create a remediation task
If your assignment doesn't show 100% compliance, create remediation tasks to evaluate and enable existing VMs. You'll most likely need to create multiple remediation tasks, one for each policy definition. You can't create a remediation task for an initiative.
To create a remediation task:
On theInitiative compliancepage, selectCreate Remediation Task.TheNew remediation taskpage appears.
On theInitiative compliancepage, selectCreate Remediation Task.

TheNew remediation taskpage appears.

ReviewRemediation settingsandResources to remediateand modify as necessary. Then selectRemediateto create the task.After the remediation tasks are finished, your VMs should be compliant with agents installed and enabled for VM insights.

Track remediation tasks
To track the progress of remediation tasks, on thePolicymenu, selectRemediationand select theRemediation taskstab.
