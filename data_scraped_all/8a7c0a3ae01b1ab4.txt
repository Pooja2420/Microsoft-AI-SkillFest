You'vecreated an Azure virtual network. You can now connect that network to SAP HANA Large Instances (otherwise known as BareMetal Infrastructure instances). In this article, we'll look at the steps you'll need to take.
Create an Azure ExpressRoute gateway on the virtual network
First, create an Azure ExpressRoute gateway on your virtual network. This gateway allows you to link the virtual network to the ExpressRoute circuit that connects to your tenant on the HANA Large Instance stamp.
Note
This step can take up to 30 minutes to complete. You create the new gateway in the designated Azure subscription and then connect it to the specified Azure virtual network.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
If a gateway already exists, check whether it's an ExpressRoute gateway. If it isn't an ExpressRoute gateway, delete the gateway and recreate it as an ExpressRoute gateway. If an ExpressRoute gateway is already established, skip to the following section of this article,Link virtual networks.

The only supported gateway SKU for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) isUltraPerformance.
Link virtual networks
The Azure virtual network now has an ExpressRoute gateway. Use the authorization information provided by Microsoft to connect the ExpressRoute gateway to the SAP HANA Large Instances ExpressRoute circuit. You can connect by using the Azure portal or PowerShell. The PowerShell instructions are as follows.
Run the following commands for each ExpressRoute gateway by using a different AuthGUID for each connection. The first two entries shown in the following script come from the information provided by Microsoft. Also, the AuthGUID is specific for every virtual network and its gateway. If you want to add another Azure virtual network, you need to get another AuthID for your ExpressRoute circuit that connects HANA Large Instances into Azure from Microsoft.

New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name $myConnectionName `
-ResourceGroupName $myGroupName -Location $myGWLocation -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gw `
-PeerId $PeerID -ConnectionType ExpressRoute -AuthorizationKey $AuthGUID -ExpressRouteGatewayBypass
Note
The last parameter in the command New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection,ExpressRouteGatewayBypass, is a new parameter that enables ExpressRoute FastPath. This functionality was added in May 2019 and reduces network latency between your HANA Large Instance units and Azure VMs. For more information, seeSAP HANA (Large Instances) network architecture. Make sure you're running the latest version of PowerShell cmdlets before running the commands.
You may need to connect the gateway to more than one ExpressRoute circuit associated with your subscription. In that case, you'll need to run this step more than once. For example, you're likely to connect the same virtual network gateway to the ExpressRoute circuit that connects the virtual network to your on-premises network.
Applying ExpressRoute FastPath to existing HANA Large Instance ExpressRoute circuits
You've seen how to connect a new ExpressRoute circuit created with a HANA Large Instance deployment to an Azure ExpressRoute gateway on one of your Azure virtual networks. But what if you already have your ExpressRoute circuits set up, and your virtual networks are already connected to HANA Large Instances?
The new ExpressRoute FastPath reduces network latency. We recommend you apply the change to take advantage of this reduced latency. The commands to connect a new ExpressRoute circuit are the same as to change an existing ExpressRoute circuit. So you'll need to run this sequence of PowerShell commands to change an existing circuit.

It's important that you add the last parameter as displayed above to enable the ExpressRoute FastPath functionality.
ExpressRoute Global Reach
Enable Global Reach for either of the following scenarios:
HANA system replication without any added proxies or firewalls.
Copying backups between HANA Large Instance units in two different regions to make system copies or for system refreshes.
To enable Global Reach:
Provide an address space range of a /29 address space. That address range may not overlap with any of the other address space ranges you used so far connecting HANA Large Instances to Azure. The address range should also not overlap with any of the IP address ranges you used elsewhere in Azure or on-premises.
There's a limitation on the autonomous system numbers (ASNs) that can be used to advertise your on-premises routes to HANA Large Instances. Your on-premises mustn't advertise any routes with private ASNs in the range of 65000 â 65020 or 65515.
When connecting on-premises direct access to HANA Large instances, you need to calculate a fee for the circuit that connects you to Azure. For more information, check the pricing forGlobal Reach Add-On.
To have one or both of the scenarios applied to your deployment, open a support message with Azure as described inOpen a support request for HANA large Instances
The data and keywords you'll need to use for Microsoft to route and execute your request are as follows:
Service: SAP HANA Large Instance
Problem type: Configuration and Setup
Problem subtype: My problem isn't listed above.
Subject "Modify my Network - add Global Reach"
Details: "Add Global Reach to HANA Large Instance to HANA Large Instance tenant." or "Add Global Reach to on-premises to HANA Large Instance tenant."
Additional details for the HANA Large Instance to HANA Large Instance tenant case: You need to define thetwo Azure regionswhere the two tenants to connect are located,ANDyou need to submit the/29 IP address range.
Additional details for the on-premises to HANA Large Instance tenant case:Define theAzure Regionwhere the HANA Large Instance tenant is deployed that you want to directly connect to.Provide theAuth GUIDandCircuit Peer IDyou received when you established your ExpressRoute circuit between on-premises and Azure.Name yourASN.Provide a/29 IP address rangefor ExpressRoute Global Reach.
Define theAzure Regionwhere the HANA Large Instance tenant is deployed that you want to directly connect to.
Provide theAuth GUIDandCircuit Peer IDyou received when you established your ExpressRoute circuit between on-premises and Azure.
Name yourASN.
Provide a/29 IP address rangefor ExpressRoute Global Reach.
Note
If you want to have both cases handled, you need to supply two different /29 IP address ranges that don't overlap with any other IP address range used so far.
