Activate my Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management
How-to
2025-04-25

In this article
Use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM), to allow eligible role members for Azure resources to schedule activation for a future date and time. They can also select a specific activation duration within the maximum (configured by administrators).
This article is for members who need to activate their Azure resource role in Privileged Identity Management.
Note
As of March 2023, you may now activate your assignments and view your access directly from blades outside of PIM in the Azure portal. Read morehere.
Important
When a role is activated, Microsoft Entra PIM temporarily adds active assignment for the role. Microsoft Entra PIM creates active assignment (assigns user to a role) within seconds. When deactivation (manual or through activation time expiration) happens, Microsoft Entra PIM removes the active assignment within seconds as well.
Application may provide access based on the role the user has. In some situations, application access may not immediately reflect the fact that user got role assigned or removed. If application previously cached the fact that user does not have a role â when user tries to access application again, access may not be provided. Similarly, if application previously cached the fact that user has a role â when role is deactivated, user may still get access. Specific situation depends on the applicationâs architecture. For some applications, signing out and signing back in may help get access added or removed.
Prerequisites
Activate a role
When you need to take on an Azure resource role, you can request activation by using theMy rolesnavigation option in Privileged Identity Management.
Note
PIM is now available in the Azure mobile app (iOS | Android) for Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles. Easily activate eligible assignments, request renewals for ones that are expiring, or check the status of pending requests.Read more below

Activate a role with Azure Resource Manager API
Privileged Identity Management supports Azure Resource Manager API commands to manage Azure resource roles, as documented in thePIM ARM API reference. For the permissions required to use the PIM API, seeUnderstand the Privileged Identity Management APIs.
To activate an eligible Azure role assignment and gain activated access, use theRole Assignment Schedule Requests - Create REST APIto create a new request and specify the security principal, role definition, requestType = SelfActivate and scope. To call this API, you must have an eligible role assignment on the scope.
Use a GUID tool to generate a unique identifier for the role assignment identifier. The identifier has the format: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.
Replace {roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName} in the PUT request with the GUID identifier of the role assignment.
For more information about eligible roles for Azure resources management, seePIM ARM API tutorial.
This is a sample HTTP request to activate an eligible assignment for an Azure role.

Deactivate a role assignment
When a role assignment is activated, you see aDeactivateoption in the PIM portal for the role assignment. Also, you can't deactivate a role assignment within five minutes after activation.
Activate with Azure portal
Privileged Identity Management role activation is integrated into the Billing and Access Control (AD) extensions within the Azure portal. Shortcuts to Subscriptions (billing) and Access Control (AD) allow you to activate PIM roles directly from these blades.
From the Subscriptions blade, select âView eligible subscriptionsâ in the horizontal command menu to check your eligible, active, and expired assignments. From there, you can activate an eligible assignment in the same pane.


In Access control (IAM) for a resource, you can now select âView my accessâ to see your currently active and eligible role assignments and activate directly.

By integrating PIM capabilities into different Azure portal blades, this new feature allows you to gain temporary access to view or edit subscriptions and resources more easily.
Activate PIM roles using the Azure mobile app
PIM is now available in the Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles mobile apps in both iOS and Android.
To activate an eligible Microsoft Entra role assignment, start by downloading the Azure mobile app (iOS|Android). You can also download the app by selectingOpen in mobilefrom Privileged Identity Management > My roles > Microsoft Entra roles.
