BULK INSERT
Title: BULK INSERT with non-Azure blob data source isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.Category: Issue
DescriptionAzure SQL Database can't access file shares or Windows folders. See the "Affected Objects" section for the specific uses ofBULK INSERTstatements that don't reference an Azure blob. Objects withBULK INSERTwhere the source isn't Azure Blob Storage doesn't work after migrating to Azure SQL Database.
BULK INSERT
BULK INSERT
RecommendationYou need to convertBULK INSERTstatements that use local files or file shares to use files from Azure Blob Storage instead, when migrating to Azure SQL Database. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
BULK INSERT
COMPUTE clause
Title: COMPUTE clause is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Warning
DescriptionThe COMPUTE clause generates totals that appear as additional summary columns at the end of the result set. However, this clause is no longer supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationThe T-SQL module needs to be rewritten using the ROLLUP operator instead. The code below demonstrates howCOMPUTEcan be replaced withROLLUP:
COMPUTE
ROLLUP
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
ORDER BY SalesOrderID COMPUTE SUM(UnitPrice),
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) BY SalesOrderID;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount,
    SUM(UnitPrice) AS UnitPrice,
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) AS UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
GROUP BY SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
WITH ROLLUP;
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
ORDER BY SalesOrderID COMPUTE SUM(UnitPrice),
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) BY SalesOrderID;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount,
    SUM(UnitPrice) AS UnitPrice,
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) AS UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
GROUP BY SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
WITH ROLLUP;

CLR assemblies
Title: SQL CLR assemblies aren't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Issue
DescriptionAzure SQL Database doesn't support SQL CLR assemblies.
RecommendationCurrently, there's no way to achieve this in Azure SQL Database. The recommended alternative solutions require application code and database changes to use only assemblies supported by Azure SQL Database. Alternatively migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
For more information, seeUnsupported Transact-SQL differences in SQL Database.
Cryptographic provider
Title: A use of CREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER or ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER was found, which isn't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Issue
DescriptionAzure SQL Database doesn't support CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER statements because it can't access files. See the Affected Objects section for the specific uses of CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER statements. Objects withCREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDERorALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDERdoesn't work correctly after migrating to Azure SQL Database.
CREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER
ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER
RecommendationReview objects withCREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDERorALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER. In any such objects that are required, remove the uses of these features. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
CREATE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER
ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER
Cross database references
Title: Cross-database queries aren't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Issue
DescriptionDatabases on this server use cross-database queries, which aren't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationAzure SQL Database doesn't support cross-database queries. The following actions are recommended:
Migrate the dependent databases to Azure SQL Database, and use Elastic Database Query (currently in preview) functionality, to query across Azure SQL databases.
Move the dependent datasets from other databases into the database that is being migrated.
Migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance.
Migrate to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
For more information, seeAzure SQL Database elastic query overview (preview).
Database compatibility
Title: Azure SQL Database doesn't support compatibility levels below 100.Category: Warning
DescriptionDatabase compatibility level is a valuable tool to help with database modernization, by allowing the SQL Server Database Engine to be upgraded, while keeping connecting applications functional status by maintaining the same pre-upgrade database compatibility level. Azure SQL Database doesn't support compatibility levels below 100.
RecommendationEvaluate if the application functionality is intact when the database compatibility level is upgraded to 100 on Azure SQL Managed Instance. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
Database Mail
Title: Database Mail isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.Category: Warning
DescriptionThis server uses the Database Mail feature, which isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationConsider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance that supports Database Mail. Alternatively, consider using Azure functions and SendGrid to accomplish mail functionality on Azure SQL Database.
Database principal alias
Title: SYS.DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_ALIASES is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Issue
Descriptionsys.database_principal_aliasesis no longer supported and has been removed in Azure SQL Database.
sys.database_principal_aliases
RecommendationUse roles instead of aliases.
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server.
DISABLE_DEF_CNST_CHK option
Title: SET option DISABLE_DEF_CNST_CHK is discontinued and has been removed.Category: Issue
DescriptionSET option DISABLE_DEF_CNST_CHK is discontinued and has been removed in Azure SQL Database.
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server.
FASTFIRSTROW hint
Title: FASTFIRSTROW query hint is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Warning
DescriptionFASTFIRSTROW query hint is no longer supported and has been removed in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationInstead of FASTFIRSTROW query hint use OPTION (FAST n).
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server.
FILESTREAM
Title: FILESTREAM isn't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Issue
DescriptionThe FILESTREAM feature, which allows you to store unstructured data such as text documents, images, and videos in NTFS file system, isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationUpload the unstructured files to Azure Blob storage and store metadata related to these files (name, type, URL location, storage key etc.) in Azure SQL Database. You might have to re-engineer your application to enable streaming blobs to and from Azure SQL Database. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
For more information, seeStreaming blobs to and from Azure SQL blog.
Linked server
Title: Linked server functionality isn't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Issue
DescriptionLinked servers enable the SQL Server Database Engine to execute commands against OLE DB data sources outside of the instance of SQL Server.
RecommendationAzure SQL Database doesn't support linked server functionality. The following actions are recommended to eliminate the need for linked servers:
Identify the dependent datasets from remote SQL servers and consider moving these into the database being migrated.
Migrate the dependent databases to Azure and use Elastic Database Query (preview) functionality to query across databases in Azure SQL Database.
For more information, seeAzure SQL Database elastic query overview (preview).
MS DTC
Title: BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.Category: Issue
DescriptionDistributed transaction started by Transact SQL BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION and managed by Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationReview affected objects section in Azure Migrate to see all objects using BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION. Consider migrating the participant databases to Azure SQL Managed Instance where distributed transactions across multiple instances are supported.
For more information, seeTransactions across multiple servers for Azure SQL Managed Instance.
Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
OPENROWSET (bulk)
Title: OpenRowSet used in bulk operation with non-Azure blob storage data source isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.Category: Issue
DescriptionOPENROWSET supports bulk operations through a built-in BULK provider that enables data from a file to be read and returned as a rowset. OPENROWSET with non-Azure blob storage data source isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationAzure SQL Database can't access file shares and Windows folders, so the files must be imported from Azure Blob Storage. Therefore, only blob type DATASOURCE is supported in OPENROWSET function. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
For more information, seeResolving Transact-SQL differences during migration to SQL Database.
OPENROWSET (provider)
Title: OpenRowSet with SQL or non-SQL provider isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.Category: Issue
DescriptionOpenRowSet with SQL or non-SQL provider is an alternative to accessing tables in a linked server and is a one-time, ad hoc method of connecting and accessing remote data by using OLE DB. OpenRowSet with SQL or non-SQL provider isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationAzure SQL Database supports OPENROWSET only to import from Azure Blob Storage. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
For more information, seeResolving Transact-SQL differences during migration to SQL Database.
Non-ANSI left outer join
Title: Non-ANSI style left outer join is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Warning
DescriptionNon-ANSI style left outer join is no longer supported and has been removed in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationUse ANSI join syntax.
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server.
Non-ANSI right outer join
Title: Non-ANSI style right outer join is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Warning
DescriptionNon-ANSI style right outer join is no longer supported and has been removed in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationUse ANSI join syntax.
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server.
Next column
Title: Tables and Columns named NEXT will lead to an error In Azure SQL Database.Category: Issue
DescriptionTables or columns named NEXT were detected. Sequences, introduced in Microsoft SQL Server, use the ANSI standard NEXT VALUE FOR function. If a table or a column is named NEXT and the column is aliased as VALUE, and if the ANSI standard AS is omitted, the resulting statement can cause an error.
RecommendationRewrite statements to include the ANSI standard AS keyword when aliasing a table or column. For example, when a column is named NEXT and that column is aliased as VALUE, the querySELECT NEXT VALUE FROM TABLEcauses an error, and should be rewritten as SELECT NEXT AS VALUE FROM TABLE. Similarly, when a table is named NEXT and that table is aliased as VALUE, the querySELECT Col1 FROM NEXT VALUEcauses an error, and should be rewritten asSELECT Col1 FROM NEXT AS VALUE.
SELECT NEXT VALUE FROM TABLE
SELECT Col1 FROM NEXT VALUE
SELECT Col1 FROM NEXT AS VALUE
RAISERROR
Title: Legacy style RAISERROR calls should be replaced with modern equivalents.Category: Warning
DescriptionRAISERROR calls like the below example are termed as legacy-style because they don't include the commas and the parenthesis.RAISERROR 50001 'this is a test'. This method of calling RAISERROR is no longer supported and removed in Azure SQL Database.
RAISERROR 50001 'this is a test'
RecommendationRewrite the statement using the current RAISERROR syntax, or evaluate if the modern approach ofBEGIN TRY { } END TRY BEGIN CATCH { THROW; } END CATCHis feasible.
BEGIN TRY { } END TRY BEGIN CATCH { THROW; } END CATCH
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server.
Server audits
Title: Use Azure SQL Database audit features to replace Server AuditsCategory: Warning
DescriptionServer Audits isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationConsider Azure SQL Database audit features to replace Server Audits. Azure SQL supports audit and the features are richer than SQL Server. Azure SQL Database can audit various database actions and events, including: Access to data, Schema changes (DDL), Data changes (DML), Accounts, roles, and permissions (DCL, Security exceptions. Azure SQL Database Auditing increases an organization's ability to gain deep insight into events and changes that occur within their database, including updates and queries against the data. Alternatively migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
For more information, seeAuditing for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics.
Server credentials
Title: Server scoped credential isn't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Warning
DescriptionA credential is a record that contains the authentication information (credentials) required to connect to a resource outside SQL Server. Azure SQL Database supports database credentials, but not the ones created at the SQL Server scope.
RecommendationAzure SQL Database supports database scoped credentials. Convert server scoped credentials to database scoped credentials. Alternatively migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
For more information, seeCREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL
Service Broker
Title: Service Broker feature isn't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Issue
DescriptionSQL Server Service Broker provides native support for messaging and queuing applications in the SQL Server Database Engine. Service Broker feature isn't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationService Broker feature isn't supported in Azure SQL Database. Consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance that supports service broker within the same instance. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
Server-scoped triggers
Title: Server-scoped trigger isn't supported in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Warning
DescriptionA trigger is a special type of stored procedure that executes in response to certain action on a table like insertion, deletion, or updating of data. Server-scoped triggers aren't supported in Azure SQL Database. Azure SQL Database doesn't support the following options for triggers: FOR LOGON, ENCRYPTION, WITH APPEND, NOT FOR REPLICATION, EXTERNAL NAME option (there's no external method support), ALL SERVER Option (DDL Trigger), Trigger on a LOGON event (Logon Trigger), Azure SQL Database doesn't support CLR-triggers.
RecommendationUse database level trigger instead. Alternatively migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
For more information, seeResolving Transact-SQL differences during migration to SQL Database.
SQL Agent jobs
Title: SQL Server Agent jobs aren't available in Azure SQL DatabaseCategory: Warning
DescriptionSQL Server Agent is a Microsoft Windows service that executes scheduled administrative tasks, which are called jobs in SQL Server. SQL Server Agent jobs aren't available in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationUse elastic jobs, which are the replacement for SQL Server Agent jobs in Azure SQL Database. Elastic jobs for Azure SQL Database allow you to reliably execute T-SQL scripts that span multiple databases while automatically retrying and providing eventual completion guarantees. Alternatively consider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. For more information, seeElastic jobs in Azure SQL Database.
SQL Database size
Title: Azure SQL Database doesn't support database size greater than 100 TB.Category: Issue
DescriptionThe size of the database is greater than the maximum supported size of 100 TB.
RecommendationEvaluate if the data can be archived or compressed or sharded into multiple databases. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
For more information, seevCore resource limits.
SQL Mail
Title: SQL Mail has been discontinued.Category: Warning
DescriptionSQL Mail has been discontinued and removed in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationConsider migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines and use Database Mail.

DescriptionFollowing unsupported system and extended stored procedures can't be used in Azure SQL Database -sp_dboption,sp_addserver,sp_dropalias,sp_activedirectory_obj,sp_activedirectory_scp,sp_activedirectory_start.
sp_dboption
sp_addserver
sp_dropalias
sp_activedirectory_obj
sp_activedirectory_scp
sp_activedirectory_start
RecommendationRemove references to unsupported system procedures that have been removed in Azure SQL Database.
For more information, seeDiscontinued Database Engine functionality in SQL Server
Trace flags
Title: Azure SQL Database doesn't support trace flagsCategory: Warning
DescriptionTrace flags are used to temporarily set specific server characteristics or to switch off a particular behavior. Trace flags are frequently used to diagnose performance issues or to debug stored procedures or complex computer systems. Azure SQL Database doesn't support trace flags.
RecommendationReview affected objects section in Azure Migrate to see all trace flags that aren't supported in Azure SQL Database and evaluate if they can be removed. Alternatively, migrate to Azure SQL Managed Instance, which supports limited number of global trace flags or SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
For more information, seeResolving Transact-SQL differences during migration to SQL Database.
Windows authentication
Title: Database users mapped with Windows authentication (integrated security) aren't supported in Azure SQL Database.Category: Warning
DescriptionAzure SQL Database supports two types of authentication:
SQL Authentication: uses a username and password
Microsoft Entra authentication: uses identities managed by Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) and is supported for managed and integrated domains.
Database users mapped with Windows authentication (integrated security) aren't supported in Azure SQL Database.
RecommendationFederate the local Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID. The Windows identity can then be replaced with the equivalent Microsoft Entra identities. Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
For more information, seeSQL Database security capabilities.
