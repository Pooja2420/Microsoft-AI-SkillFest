For more information, seeMultitenant Hosting for Windows 11.
Note
To use Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 images for development or testing seeWindows client in Azure for dev/test scenarios
Student & Free Trial accounts are enabled to deploy Windows 11 images for development or testing purposes.
For Windows Server licensing benefits, please refer toAzure Hybrid use benefits for Windows Server images.
When selecting a VM size, ensure the size meets theWindows 11 hardware minimum requirements
Subscription Licenses that qualify for Multitenant Hosting Rights
For more details about subscription licenses that qualify to run Windows 11 on Azure, download theWindows 11 licensing brief for Virtual Desktops
Important
Usersmusthave one of the below subscription licenses in order to use Windows 11 images in Azure for any production workload. If you do not have one of these subscription licenses, they can be purchased through yourCloud Service Partneror directly throughMicrosoft.
Operating systems and licenses
You have a choice of operating systems that you can use for session hosts to provide virtual desktops and remote apps. You can use different operating systems with different host pools to provide flexibility to your users. Supported dates are inline with theMicrosoft Lifecycle Policy.

Operating system licenses
Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session
Windows 11 Enterprise
Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1909 and later (For Windows 10 deployments)
License entitlement
Microsoft 365 E3, E5, A3, A5, F3, Business Premium, Student Use Benefit
Windows Enterprise E3, E5
Windows VDA E3, E5
Windows Education A3, A5
External users can useper-user access pricinginstead of license entitlement.

Note
If you are upgrading to a newer version of Windows 11 with Trusted launch enabled and you are currently on a Windows 11 version without Trusted Launch enabled, the VM needs to be deallocated before proceeding with the upgrade. For more information, seeEnabling Trusted Launch on existing Azure VMs
Uploading Windows 11 VHD to Azure
If you're uploading a generalized Windows 11 VHD,  note Windows 11 doesn't have built-in administrator account enabled by default. To enable the built-in administrator account, include the following command as part of the Custom Script extension.
Net user <username> /active:yes
Net user <username> /active:yes
The following PowerShell snippet is to mark all administrator accounts as active, including the built-in administrator. This example is useful if the built-in administrator username is unknown.
$adminAccount = Get-WmiObject Win32_UserAccount -filter "LocalAccount=True" | ? {$_.SID -Like "S-1-5-21-*-500"}
if($adminAccount.Disabled)
{
    $adminAccount.Disabled = $false
    $adminAccount.Put()
}
$adminAccount = Get-WmiObject Win32_UserAccount -filter "LocalAccount=True" | ? {$_.SID -Like "S-1-5-21-*-500"}
if($adminAccount.Disabled)
{
    $adminAccount.Disabled = $false
    $adminAccount.Put()
}

How to upload VHD to Azure
How to prepare a Windows VHD to upload to Azure
Deploying Windows 11 with Multitenant Hosting Rights
Make sure you'veinstalled and configured the latest Azure PowerShell. Once you've prepared your VHD, upload the VHD to your Azure Storage account using theAdd-AzVhdcmdlet as follows:
Add-AzVhd
Add-AzVhd -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -LocalFilePath "C:\Path\To\myvhd.vhd" `
    -Destination "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/myvhd.vhd"
Add-AzVhd -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -LocalFilePath "C:\Path\To\myvhd.vhd" `
    -Destination "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/myvhd.vhd"
Deploy using Azure Resource Manager Template DeploymentWithin your Resource Manager templates, an additional parameter forlicenseTypecan be specified. You can read more aboutauthoring Azure Resource Manager templates. Once you've your VHD uploaded to Azure, edit your Resource Manager template to include the license type as part of the compute provider and deploy your template as normal:
licenseType
"properties": {
    "licenseType": "Windows_Client",
    "hardwareProfile": {
        "vmSize": "[variables('vmSize')]"
    }
"properties": {
    "licenseType": "Windows_Client",
    "hardwareProfile": {
        "vmSize": "[variables('vmSize')]"
    }
Deploy via PowerShellWhen deploying your Windows Server VM via PowerShell, you need to add another parameter for-LicenseType. Once you have your VHD uploaded to Azure, you can create a VM usingNew-AzVMand specify the licensing type as follows:
-LicenseType
New-AzVM
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "West US" -VM $vm -LicenseType "Windows_Client"
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "West US" -VM $vm -LicenseType "Windows_Client"
Verify your VM is utilizing the licensing benefit
Once you've deployed your VM through either the PowerShell or Resource Manager deployment method, verify the license type withGet-AzVM:
Get-AzVM
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
The output is similar to the following example for Windows 10 with correct license type:
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : westus
LicenseType              : Windows_Client
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : westus
LicenseType              : Windows_Client
This output contrasts with the following VM deployed without Azure Hybrid Use Benefit licensing, such as a VM deployed straight from the Azure Gallery:
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : westus
LicenseType              :
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : westus
LicenseType              :

Additional Information about joining Microsoft Entra ID
Azure provisions all Windows VMs with built-in administrator account, which can't be used to join Microsoft Entra ID. For example,Settings > Account > Access Work or School > + Connectwon't work. You must create and log on as a second administrator account to join Microsoft Entra ID manually. You can also configure Microsoft Entra ID using a provisioning package, use the link in theNext Stepssection to learn more.
