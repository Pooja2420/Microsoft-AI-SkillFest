The Azure VMware Solution private gives you the ability to deploy a vSphere cluster in Azure. For each private cloud created, there's one vSAN cluster by default. You can add, delete, and scale clusters.  The minimum number of hosts per cluster is three. More hosts can be added one at a time, up to a maximum of 16 hosts per cluster. The maximum number of clusters per private cloud is 12.  The initial deployment of Azure VMware Solution has three hosts.
You use vCenter Server and NSX-T Manager to manage most other aspects of cluster configuration or operation. All local storage of each host in a cluster is under the control of vSAN.
Tip
You can always extend the cluster and add more clusters later if you need to go beyond the initial deployment number.
Because Azure VMware Solution doesn't allow you to manage your private cloud with your cloud vCenter Server at launch, you need to do more steps for the configuration. This tutorial covers these steps and related prerequisites.
In this tutorial, learn how to:
Create an Azure VMware Solution private cloud
Verify the private cloud deployed
Prerequisites
Appropriate administrative rights and permission to create a private cloud. You must be at minimum contributor level in the subscription.
Follow the information you gathered in theplanningtutorial to deploy Azure VMware Solution.
Ensure you have the appropriate networking configured as described in theNetwork planning checklist.
Hosts provisioned and the Microsoft.AVSresource provider is registered.
Create a private cloud
You can create an Azure VMware Solution private cloud using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

All resources in an Azure subscription are billed together.Resource groupSelect the resource group for your private cloud. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Alternatively, you can create a new resource group for your private cloud.Resource nameProvide the name of your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.LocationSelect a location, such as(US) East US 2.

The default value is 3, which you can increase or decrease after deployment. If these nodes aren't listed as available, contact support torequest a quota increase. You can also select the link labeledIf you need more hosts, request a quota increasein the Azure portal.Address block for private cloudProvide an IP address block for the private cloud.  The CIDR represents the private cloud management network and is used for the cluster management services, such as vCenter Server and NSX-T Manager. Use /22 address space, for example, 10.175.0.0/22.  The address should be unique and not overlap with other Azure Virtual Networks and with on-premises networks.

Verify that the deployment was successful. Navigate to the resource group you created and select your private cloud.  You see the status ofSucceededwhen the deployment is finished.

Instead of the Azure portal to create an Azure VMware Solution private cloud, you can use the Azure CLI using the Azure Cloud Shell. For a list of commands you can use with Azure VMware Solution, seeAzure VMware commands.
To begin using Azure CLI:
Use the Bash environment inAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell.
Use the Bash environment inAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell.

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, seeUse and manage extensions with the Azure CLI.Runaz versionto find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, runaz upgrade.
