Azure Database for MySQL is a managed service for running, managing, and scaling highly available MySQL servers in the cloud. This article shows you how to use the Azure portal to create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance. You create an instance of Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server using a defined set ofcompute and storage resources.
Prerequisites
Azure subscription
Access to the Azure portal
Basic knowledge of Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server deployment options and configurations
Sign in to the Azure portal
Enter your credentials to sign in to theAzure portal.
Create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server
Create the server within anAzure resource group.
Complete these steps to create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server:
In the Azure portal, search for and then selectAzure Database for MySQL Flexible Servers.
In the Azure portal, search for and then selectAzure Database for MySQL Flexible Servers.

SelectCreate.
SelectCreate.
On theSelect Azure Database for MySQL deployment optionpane, selectFlexible serveras the deployment option:

On theBasicstab, enter or select the following information:SettingSuggested valueDescriptionSubscriptionYour subscription nameThe Azure subscription you want to use for your server. Choose the subscription for which you want to be billed for the resource if you have multiple subscriptions.Resource groupmyresourcegroupCreate a new resource group name, or select an existing resource group from your subscription.Server namemydemoserver-quickstartA unique name that identifies your instance of Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server. The domain namemysql.database.azure.comis appended to the server name you enter. The server name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must contain between 3 and 63 characters.RegionThe region closest to your usersThe location closest to your users.MySQL version8.0The major engine version.Workload typeDevelopmentFor production workload, you can selectSmall/Medium-sizeorLarge-sizedepending onmax_connectionsrequirementsCompute + storageBurstable,Standard_B1ms,10 GiB,100 iops,7 daysThe compute, storage, input/output operations per second (IOPS), and backup configurations for your new server. On theConfigure serverpane, the default values forCompute tier,Compute size,Storage size,iops, andRetention period(for backup) areBurstable,Standard_B1ms,10 GiB,100 iops, and7 days. You can keep the default values or modify these values. For faster data loads during migration, we recommend increasing IOPS to the maximum size supported for the compute size you selected. Later, scale it back to minimize cost. To save the compute and storage selection, selectSaveto continue with the configuration.Availability zoneNo preferenceIf your application client is provisioned in a specific availability zone, you can set your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server to the same availability zone to colocate the application and reduce network latency.High availabilityClearedFor production servers, choose betweenzone-redundant high availabilityandsame-zone high availability. We recommend high availability for business continuity and protection against virtual machine (VM) failure.Authentication methodMySQL and Microsoft Entra authenticationSelect the authentication methods you would like to support for accessing this MySQL server.Admin usernamemydemouserYour sign-in account is to be used when you connect to the server. The admin username can't beazure_superuser,admin,administrator,root,guest,sa, orpublic. The maximum number of characters that are allowed is 32.PasswordYour passwordA new password for the server admin account. It must contain between 8 and 128 characters. It also must contain characters from three of the following categories: English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers (0 through 9), and nonalphanumeric characters (!,$,#,%, and so on).

Next, configure networking options.On theNetworkingtab, set how your server is accessed. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server offers two ways to connect to your server:Public access (allowed IP addresses)Private access (virtual network integration)When you use public access, access to your server is limited to the allowed IP addresses you add to a firewall rule. This method prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server and any databases on the server unless you create a rule to open the firewall for a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. When you selectCreate an azuredeploy.json file, access to your server is limited to your virtual network. For more information about private access, see theconceptsarticle.In this quickstart, you learn how to set public access to connect to the server. On theNetworking tab, forConnectivity method, selectPublic access. To set firewall rules, selectAdd current client IP address.You can't change the connectivity method after you create the server. For example, if you selectPublic access (allowed IP addresses)when you create the server, you can't change the setting toPrivate access (VNet Integration)after the server is deployed. We highly recommend that you create your server to use private access to help secure access to your server via virtual network integration. For more information about private access, see theconceptsarticle.

These databases are created by default under your server:information_schema,mysql,performance_schema, andsys.
Note
To avoid connectivity problems, check whether your network allows outbound traffic through port 3306, which Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server uses.
Connect to the server
Before you start, download thepublic SSL certificatefor certificate authority verification.
If you deploy Azure Database for MySQL using the public access connectivity method, you can get started quickly by using the built-in MySQL command-line client tool or Azure Cloud Shell. To use the command-line tool, on the menu bar in the Overview pane, select Connect.
Note
You can also use theMySQL extensionin Azure Data Studio to connect to your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.

After you selectConnect, you can see details about connecting locally using the Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server client tool and how to initiate data import and export operations.
Important
If you see the following error message when you connect to your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, either you didn't select theAllow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this servercheckbox when you set up your firewall rules, or the option isn't saved. Set the firewall rules, and then try again.
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on <servername> (115)
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on <servername> (115)
Clean up resources
When you no longer need the resources you created for this quickstart, you can delete the resource group that contains the Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance. Select the resource group for the Azure Database for MySQL resource, and then selectDelete. Enter the name of the resource group that you want to delete.
