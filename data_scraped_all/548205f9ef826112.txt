As part of your migration journey to Azure, you discover your on-premises inventory and workloads.
This tutorial shows you how to discover the servers that are running in your VMware environment by using the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool, a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance. You deploy the appliance as a server running in your vCenter Server instance, to continuously discover servers and their performance metadata, applications that are running on servers, server dependencies, web apps, and SQL Server instances and databases.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Set up an Azure account.
Prepare the VMware environment for discovery.
Create a project.
Set up the Azure Migrate appliance.
Start continuous discovery.
Note
Tutorials show you the quickest path for trying out a scenario. They use default options where possible. This scenario is also applicable for discovery of VM servers from AVS.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, check that you have these prerequisites in place:
Prepare an Azure user account
To create a project and register the Azure Migrate appliance, you must have an Azure account that has these permissions:
Contributor or Owner permissions in the Azure subscription.
Permissions to register Microsoft Entra apps.
Owner or Contributor and User Access Administrator permissions at subscription level to create an instance of Azure Key Vault, which is used during agentless server migration.
If you created a free Azure account, by default, you're the owner of the Azure subscription. If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign permissions.
To set Contributor or Owner permissions in the Azure subscription:
In the Azure portal, search for "subscriptions." UnderServicesin the search results, selectSubscriptions.

Prepare VMware
On vCenter Server, check that your account haspermissionsto create a VM by using a VMware Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA) virtual machine (VM) installation file. You must have thesepermissionswhen you deploy the Azure Migrate appliance as a VMware VM by using an OVA file.
Azure Migrate must have a vCenter Server read-only account to discover and assess servers running in your VMware environment. If you also want to run discovery of installed applications and agentless dependency analysis, the account must havepermissionsenabled in VMware for VM guest operations.
Create an account to access vCenter Server
In VMware vSphere Web Client, set up a read-only account to use for vCenter Server:
From an account that has admin privileges, in vSphere Web Client, on theHomemenu, selectAdministration.

UnderPrivileges, selectGuest operations. To propagate the privileges to all objects in the vCenter Server instance, select thePropagate to childrencheckbox.

Note
For vCenter Server 7.x and above you must clone the Read Only system role and add the Guest Operations Privileges to the cloned role.  Assign the cloned role to the vCenter Account. Learn how tocreate a custom role in VMware vCenter.
You can scope the vCenter Server account to limit discovery to specific vCenter Server datacenters, clusters, hosts, folders of clusters or hosts, or individual servers. Learn how toscope the vCenter Server user account.
vCenter assets connected via Linked-Mode to the vCenter server specified for discovery will not be discovered by Azure Migrate.
Create an account to access servers
Note
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) accounts are not supported for discovery.
Your user account on your servers must have the required permissions to initiate discovery of installed applications, agentless dependency analysis, and discovery of web apps, and SQL Server instances and databases. You can provide the user account information in the appliance configuration manager. The appliance doesn't install agents on the servers.
To perform software inventory and agentless dependency analysis, create a guest user account (local or domain) on the servers. To perform web app discovery, you need an account with administrative permissions on the servers. To discover SQL Server instances and databases, the Windows or SQL Server account must be a member of the sysadmin server role or havethese permissionsfor each SQL Server instance. Learn how toassign the required role to the user account.
ForLinux servers, provide a sudo user account with permissions to execute ls and netstat commands or create a user account that has the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH and CAP_SYS_PTRACE permissions on /bin/netstat and /bin/ls files. If you're providing a sudo user account, ensure that you have enabledNOPASSWDfor the account to run the required commands without prompting for a password every time sudo command is invoked.
Note
You can add multiple server credentials in the Azure Migrate appliance configuration manager to initiate discovery of installed applications, agentless dependency analysis, and discovery of web apps, and SQL Server instances and databases. You can add multiple domain, Windows (non-domain), Linux (non-domain), or SQL Server authentication credentials. Learn how toadd server credentials.

If you've already created a project, you can use that project to register more appliances to discover and to assess more servers. Learn how tomanage projects.
Set up the appliance
The Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool uses a lightweight Azure Migrate appliance. The appliance completes server discovery and sends server configuration and performance metadata to Azure Migrate. Set up the appliance by deploying an OVA template that can be downloaded from the project.
Note
If you can't set up the appliance by using the OVA template, you can set it up by running a PowerShell script on an existing server running Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022. Learn how touse PowerShell to set up an Azure Migrate appliance.The option to deploy an appliance using an OVA template isn't supported in Azure Government cloud.Learn moreon how to deploy an appliance for Azure Government cloud.
Deploy by using an OVA template
To set up the appliance by using an OVA template, complete these steps, which are described in more detail in this section:
Provide an appliance name and generate a project key in the portal.
Download an OVA template file, and then import it to vCenter Server. Verify that the OVA is secure.
Create the appliance from the OVA file. Verify that the appliance can connect to Azure Migrate.
Configure the appliance for the first time.
Register the appliance with the project by using the project key.
InMigration goals, selectServers, databases and web apps>Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment>Discover.
InDiscover servers, selectAre your servers virtualized?>Yes, with VMware vSphere hypervisor.
In1:Generate project key, provide a name for the Azure Migrate appliance that you'll set up to discover servers in your VMware environment. The name should be alphanumeric and 14 characters or fewer.
To start creating the required Azure resources, selectGenerate key. Don't close theDiscoverpane while the resources are being created.
After the Azure resources are successfully created, aproject keyis generated.
Copy the key. You'll use the key to complete registration of the appliance when you configure the appliance.

By default, Azure Migrate uses the most secure way of connecting to SQL instances that is, Azure Migrate encrypts communication between the Azure Migrate appliance and the source SQL Server instances by setting the TrustServerCertificate property totrue. Additionally, the transport layer uses TLS to encrypt the channel and bypass the certificate chain to validate trust. Hence, the appliance server must be set up to trust the certificate's root authority. However, you can modify the connection settings, by selectingEdit SQL Server connection propertieson the appliance.Learn moreto understand what to choose.
