Adding tasks to backlog items is essential for tracking the work required to implement them. Tasks also help estimate the effort assigned to individual team members and the team as a whole. The capacity tool indicates how much work your team can commit to. To effectively compare capacity with planned work, define and estimate tasks for each backlog item.
Define comprehensive tasks
Capture all work:Add as many tasks as needed to fully capture the work required to complete each backlog item.
Differentiate work types:Represent various activities such as design, coding, testing, content creation, or sign-offs with separate tasks.
Assign responsibility:Individual tasks:Team members typically add their own tasks and set estimates for their workload.Initial tasks:A development lead can define the initial tasks for a story or requirement.

Initial tasks:A development lead can define the initial tasks for a story or requirement.
Estimate effort
Set estimates:Assign effort estimates to each task to help gauge the total work required.
Align with capacity:Use the capacity tool to ensure that the estimated work aligns with your teamâs available capacity.
By effectively adding and managing tasks, your team gains a clear understanding of the relative importance and required effort for each item, ensuring better workload distribution and project planning.

Open the sprint Taskboard for your team
From your project, open the sprint backlog for your team.
From your project, open the sprint backlog for your team.

ChooseTaskboard.To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose theView sprints directoryorBrowse all sprintsoption. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and choose the sprint you want.The system lists only those sprints that selected for the current team focus. If you don't see the sprints you want listed, then chooseNew Sprintfrom the menu, and then chooseSelect existing iteration. For more information, seeDefine iteration (sprint) paths.

Customize the Taskboard
Each team can customize theirTaskboardin the following ways:
Add or rename columns.
Customize cardsto show another fields or change card color based on specified field criteria.
Show bugs on the Taskboard. Your team can choose to manage bugs similar to product backlog items, as shown in this article, or manage them similar to tasks. When you track bugs similar to tasks, they show up on your sprint backlogs andTaskboardsat the same level as tasks.
An administrator can customize theTaskboardfor all teams in the following ways:
Add a custom workflow state to the task WIT for a process
Add a custom work item type to the Taskboard for a process

Taskboard controls
See alsoBacklog keyboard shortcuts.

Review progress in daily scrum meetings
During your daily Scrum, you can filter yourTaskboardto help focus on items of interest.
Group by Backlog items or Group by stories to monitor progress of your product backlog items, stories, requirements, or bugs.
Group by People when you want to monitor progress of individual team members.
Note
Your Taskboard automatically refreshes when changes occur. There isn't any live updates control, it simply happens in the background.  As other team members move or reorder cards on the taskboard, the Taskboard automatically updates with these changes. You don't need to press F5 to see the latest changes.
Use the Person filter when you want to focus on work assigned to individual team members.
Tip
If you're seeing tasks that don't belong to your team, check that you'veselected the correct team.

Show progress on items
With this view, you can quickly see which items are nearing completion and which have yet to be started.
To show cards based on their backlog-to-task groupings, chooseView optionsand selectStories(for Agile),Issues(for Basic),Backlog items(for Scrum), andRequirements(for CMMI).

Show a team member's progress
With this view, you can focus on the work completed and the work remaining for each individual team member. You can quickly see who might need help with completing their sprint tasks. This view shows items and tasks assigned to the selected team member.
To filter on the tasks for a specific team member, choose thefilter icon, and then select their name from theAssigned tofilter box.


Group tasks by team members
With this view, you can quickly see all the tasks associated with each team member. Backlog items don't appear in this view, only the tasks associated with each individual.
Choose theview options icon and selectPeople.Only those team members with tasks assigned to them are listed. All their tasks are shown as cards under their column state.

Update tasks during the sprint cycle
TheTaskboardmakes quick work of updating both task status and remaining work.

Update a task's status
Drag tasks to a downstream column to reflect if they are in progress or completed.

When you move a task to theDoneorCompletedcolumn, the system automatically updates theRemaining Workfield to 0 in all processes, except CMMI. If you discover more work is remaining, change the State back toIn progressorTo do, and enter a value for theRemaining Work.
Update Remaining Work
UpdateRemaining Work, preferably before the daily Scrum meeting, which helps the team stay informed of the progress being made. It also ensures a smoother burndown chart.
Each team member can review the tasks they worked on and estimate the work remaining. If they discover that it's taking longer than expected to complete, they should increase theRemaining Workfor the task.Remaining Workshould always reflect exactly how much work the team member estimates is remaining to complete the task.


Close out a sprint and update your Taskboard
At the end of the sprint, complete these final tasks:
Zero outRemaining Workof all completed tasks
Update the status of all completed backlog items
Drag incomplete backlog items and tasks to the next sprint or back to the product backlog.
Drag an incomplete item to the product backlog or to a future sprint updates the Iteration Path of all unfinished child tasks to correspond to the product-backlog iteration path or future sprint.
See alsoEnd of sprint activities.

Reduce the number of items on the Taskboard
If you exceed the number of items allowed on your Taskboard, you receive a message indicating that you need to reduce the number of items. The maximum number of items includes work item types included in the Requirement and Task categories.
You can reduce the number of items on the Taskboard by moving them to the backlog or another sprint. When you move a parent PBI or user story, all active child tasks (State not equal to Done or Closed) automatically move with the parent item.
From the Taskboard, drag the PBI or user story from the first column onto the backlog or future sprint. All child tasks automatically move with the parent item.
From the sprint backlog, multi-select the items to move and then select the context menu for an item. Then, select the iteration to move them to.

Or, if your project uses an On-premises XML process, you canincrease the maximum number of allowed items.
