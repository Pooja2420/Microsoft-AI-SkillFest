Theartifactignorefile works similarly to agitignorefile but serves a different purpose. Instead of specifying files to be ignored by Git, it's used in Azure Pipelines to control which files are excluded when publishing pipeline artifacts or Universal Packages. This file can help reduce your pipeline execution and improve its efficiency by preventing unnecessary files from being copied into the staging directory before publishing.
artifactignore
gitignore
Theartifactignorefile has a similar syntax to that of agitignorefile and is typically stored in your version control system. However, unlikegitignore, theartifactignorefile doesn't always need to be in the root of your repository. Its location depends on the path specified in the publish task. If placed incorrectly, the task won't recognize it, leading to unintended results. For example, if the path is$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/bin/artifacts, theartifactignorefile should be placed in the/bin/artifactsdirectory.
Note
Theartifactignorefile does not work with thePublish Build Artifactstask, use thePublish Pipeline Artifactstask instead.
Syntax
The.artifactignorefollows the same syntax as the.gitignorewith a few exceptions. The plus sign character+is not supported in URL paths, and certain package types, such as Maven, may have limitations with semantic versioning metadata.

Note
By default, the.gitignorefile is ignored unless you have an.artifactignorefile. To include it, simply create an empty.artifactignorefile.
Example
In this example, all files will be ignored except for those located in thesrc/MyApp/bin/Releasedirectory.
**/*
!src/MyApp/bin/Release/**.*
**/*
!src/MyApp/bin/Release/**.*
Important
The.artifactignorefile must be placed in the directory specified in thetargetPathargument in yourPublish Pipeline Artifactstask.
