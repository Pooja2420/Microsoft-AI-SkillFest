Caution
This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see theCentOS End Of Life guidance.
This article summarizes supported components and settings for disaster recovery of VMware VMs and physical servers to Azure usingAzure Site Recovery.
Note
You can now move your existing replicated items to modernized VMware disaster recovery experience.Learn more.

Follow ourtutorialsto try out disaster recovery.
Note
Site Recovery doesn't move or store customer data out of the target region, in which disaster recovery has been set up for the source machines. Customers may select a Recovery Services Vault from a different region if they so choose. The Recovery Services Vault contains metadata but no actual customer data.
Deployment scenarios
On-premises virtualization servers
Azure Site Recovery replication appliance
The replication appliance is an on-premises machine that runs Site Recovery components, including various Site Recovery services that help with discovery of on-premises environment, orchestration of disaster recovery and act as a bridge between on-premises and Azure.
For VMware VMs, you can create the replication appliance by downloading an OVF template to create a VMware VM.
For physical servers, you can set up the replication appliance manually by running our PowerShell script.
Note
Operating system must be installed with English locale. Conversion of locale post installation could result in potential issues.
FQDN or NAT IP selection is a one time selection and can't be changed later the appliance.
Replicated machines
Site Recovery supports replication of any workload running on a supported machine.
Note
Different machines with same BIOS ID aren't supported.
For Windows
Note
Ensure that 500-MB free space is available on the installation folder in the on-premises and Azure machine.
For Linux

Mobility service versions9.56,9.60,9.62and9.63are only available for Modernized experience.Mobility service version9.58isn't released for VMware to Azure Site Recovery.Mobility service versions9.59is only available for Classic experience.

Note
For each of the Windows versions, Azure Site Recovery only supportsLong-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)builds.Semi-Annual Channelreleases are currently unsupported at this time.
Ensure that for Linux versions, Azure Site Recovery doesn't support customized OS images. Only the stock kernels that are part of the distribution minor version release/update are supported.

Rocky Linux Server supported kernel versions
Important
Support for Rocky Linux is available for Modernized experience only and not available for Classic experience.
Linux file systems/guest storage
ftype
VM/Disk management
Note
Any change to disk identity isn't supported. For example, if the disk partitioning has been changed from GPT to MBR or vice versa, then this changes the disk identity. In such a scenario, the replication breaks and a fresh setup will be required.
For Linux machines, device name change isn't supported as it has an impact on the disk identity.
In Modernized, resizing the disk size to reduce it from its original size, isn't supported.

Azure VM requirements
On-premises VMs replicated to Azure must meet the Azure VM requirements summarized in this table. When Site Recovery runs prerequisites check for replication, the check fails if some of the requirements aren't met.
Resource group limits
To understand the number of virtual machines that can be protected under a single resource group, refer to the article onsubscription limits and quotas.
Churn limits
The following table provides the Azure Site Recovery limits.
These limits are based on our tests, but don't cover all possible app I/O combinations.
Actual results can vary based on your application I/O mix.
For best results, we strongly recommend that you run theDeployment Planner tool, and perform extensive application testing using test failovers to get the true performance picture for your app.
These are average numbers assuming a 30 percent I/O overlap.
Site Recovery is capable of handling higher throughput based on overlap ratio, larger write sizes, and actual workload I/O behavior.
These numbers assume a typical backlog of approximately five minutes. That is, after data is uploaded, it's processed and a recovery point is created within five minutes.
Cache Storage account
This table summarizes support for the cache storage account used by Site Recovery during replication.
As average churn on the disks increases, the number of disks that a storage account can support decreases. The table may be used as a guide for making decisions on number of storage accounts that need to be provisioned.
The above limits are applicable to VMware and Hyper-V scenarios only.
