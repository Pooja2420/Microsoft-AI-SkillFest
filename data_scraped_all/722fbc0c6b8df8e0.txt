Every secure request to an Azure Storage account must be authorized. By default, requests can be authorized with either Microsoft Entra credentials, or by using the account access key for Shared Key authorization. Of these two types of authorization, Microsoft Entra ID provides superior security and ease of use over Shared Key, and is recommended by Microsoft. To require clients to use Microsoft Entra ID to authorize requests, you can disallow requests to the storage account that are authorized with Shared Key.
When you disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account, Azure Storage rejects all subsequent requests to that account that are authorized with the account access keys. Only secured requests that are authorized with Microsoft Entra ID will succeed. For more information about using Microsoft Entra ID, seeAuthorize access to data in Azure Storage.
TheAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty of a storage account is not set by default and does not return a value until you explicitly set it. The storage account permits requests that are authorized with Shared Key when the property value isnullor when it istrue.
This article describes how to use a DRAG (Detection-Remediation-Audit-Governance) framework to continuously manage Shared Key authorization for your storage account.
Prerequisites
Before disallowing Shared Key access on any of your storage accounts:
Understand how disallowing Shared Key affects SAS tokens
Consider compatibility with other Azure tools and services
Consider the need todisallow Shared Key authorization to use Microsoft Entra Conditional Access
Authorize access to file data or transition Azure Files workloads
Understand how disallowing Shared Key affects SAS tokens
When Shared Key access is disallowed for the storage account, Azure Storage handles SAS tokens based on the type of SAS and the service that is targeted by the request. The following table shows how each type of SAS is authorized and how Azure Storage will handle that SAS when theAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty for the storage account isfalse.
Azure metrics and logging in Azure Monitor do not distinguish between different types of shared access signatures. TheSASfilter in Azure Metrics Explorer and theSASfield in Azure Storage logging in Azure Monitor both report requests that are authorized with any type of SAS. However, different types of shared access signatures are authorized differently, and behave differently when Shared Key access is disallowed:
A service SAS token or an account SAS token is authorized with Shared Key and will not be permitted on a request to Blob storage when theAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty is set tofalse.
A user delegation SAS is authorized with Microsoft Entra ID and will be permitted on a request to Blob storage when theAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty is set tofalse.
When you are evaluating traffic to your storage account, keep in mind that metrics and logs as described inDetect the type of authorization used by client applicationsmay include requests made with a user delegation SAS.
For more information about shared access signatures, seeGrant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS).
Consider compatibility with other Azure tools and services
A number of Azure services use Shared Key authorization to communicate with Azure Storage. If you disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account, these services will not be able to access data in that account, and your applications may be adversely affected.
Some Azure tools offer the option to use Microsoft Entra authorization to access Azure Storage. The following table lists some popular Azure tools and notes whether they can use Microsoft Entra ID to authorize requests to Azure Storage.

Disallow Shared Key authorization to use Microsoft Entra Conditional Access
To protect an Azure Storage account with Microsoft EntraConditional Accesspolicies, you must disallow Shared Key authorization for the storage account.
Authorize access to file data or transition Azure Files workloads
Azure Storage supports Microsoft Entra authorization for requests to Azure Files, Blob Storage, Queue Storage, and Table Storage. However, by default the Azure portal uses Shared Key authorization to access Azure file shares. If you disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account that isn't configured with the proper RBAC assignments, requests to Azure Files will fail, and you won't be able to access Azure file shares in the Azure portal.
To mitigate this, we recommend taking one of three approaches:
Followthese stepsto authorize access to file data using your Microsoft Entra account, or
Migrate any Azure Files data to a separate storage account before you disallow access to an account via Shared Key, or
Don't apply this setting to storage accounts that support Azure Files workloads.
Identify storage accounts that allow Shared Key access
There are two ways to identify storage accounts that allow Shared Key access:
Check the Shared Key access setting for multiple accounts
Configure the Azure Policy for Shared Key access in audit mode
Check the Shared Key access setting for multiple accounts
To check the Shared Key access setting across a set of storage accounts with optimal performance, you can use the Azure Resource Graph Explorer in the Azure portal. To learn more about using the Resource Graph Explorer, seeQuickstart: Run your first Resource Graph query using Azure Resource Graph Explorer.
Running the following query in the Resource Graph Explorer returns a list of storage accounts and displays the Shared Key access setting for each account:
resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts'
| extend allowSharedKeyAccess = parse_json(properties).allowSharedKeyAccess
| project subscriptionId, resourceGroup, name, allowSharedKeyAccess
resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts'
| extend allowSharedKeyAccess = parse_json(properties).allowSharedKeyAccess
| project subscriptionId, resourceGroup, name, allowSharedKeyAccess
Configure the Azure Policy for Shared Key access in audit mode
Azure PolicyStorage accounts should prevent shared key accessprevents users with appropriate permissions from configuring new or existing storage accounts to permit Shared Key authorization. Configure this policy in audit mode to identify storage accounts where Shared Key authorization is allowed. After you have changed applications to use Microsoft Entra rather than Shared Key for authorization, you canupdate the policy to prevent allowing Shared Key access.
For more information about the built-in policy, seeStorage accounts should prevent shared key accessinList of built-in policy definitions.
Follow these steps to assign the built-in policy for the appropriate scope in the Azure portal:
In the Azure portal, search forPolicyto display the Azure Policy dashboard.

Detect the type of authorization used by client applications
To understand how disallowing Shared Key authorization may affect client applications before you make this change, enable logging and metrics for the storage account. You can then analyze patterns of requests to your account over a period of time to determine how requests are being authorized.
Use metrics to determine how many requests the storage account is receiving that are authorized with Shared Key or a shared access signature (SAS). Use logs to determine which clients are sending those requests.
A SAS may be authorized with either Shared Key or Microsoft Entra ID. For more information about interpreting requests made with a shared access signature, seeUnderstand how disallowing Shared Key affects SAS tokens.
Determine the number and frequency of requests authorized with Shared Key
To track how requests to a storage account are being authorized, use Azure Metrics Explorer in the Azure portal. For more information about Metrics Explorer, seeAnalyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer.
Follow these steps to create a metric that tracks requests made with Shared Key or SAS:
Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal. Under theMonitoringsection, selectMetrics.
Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal. Under theMonitoringsection, selectMetrics.
The new metric box should appear:If it doesn't, selectAdd metric.
The new metric box should appear:

If it doesn't, selectAdd metric.
In theMetricdialog, specify the following values:Leave theScopefield set to the name of the storage account.Set theMetric NamespacetoAccount. This metric will report on all requests against the storage account.Set theMetricfield toTransactions.Set theAggregationfield toSum.The new metric will display the sum of the number of transactions against the storage account over a given interval of time. The resulting metric appears as shown in the following image:
In theMetricdialog, specify the following values:
Leave theScopefield set to the name of the storage account.
Set theMetric NamespacetoAccount. This metric will report on all requests against the storage account.
Set theMetricfield toTransactions.
Set theAggregationfield toSum.
The new metric will display the sum of the number of transactions against the storage account over a given interval of time. The resulting metric appears as shown in the following image:

Next, select theAdd filterbutton to create a filter on the metric for type of authorization.
Next, select theAdd filterbutton to create a filter on the metric for type of authorization.
In theFilterdialog, specify the following values:Set thePropertyvalue toAuthentication.Set theOperatorfield to the equal sign (=).In theValuesfield, selectAccount KeyandSAS.
In theFilterdialog, specify the following values:
Set thePropertyvalue toAuthentication.
Set theOperatorfield to the equal sign (=).
In theValuesfield, selectAccount KeyandSAS.
In the upper-right corner, select the time range for which you want to view the metric. You can also indicate how granular the aggregation of requests should be, by specifying intervals anywhere from 1 minute to 1 month. For example, set theTime rangeto 30 days and theTime granularityto 1 day to see requests aggregated by day over the past 30 days.
In the upper-right corner, select the time range for which you want to view the metric. You can also indicate how granular the aggregation of requests should be, by specifying intervals anywhere from 1 minute to 1 month. For example, set theTime rangeto 30 days and theTime granularityto 1 day to see requests aggregated by day over the past 30 days.
After you have configured the metric, requests to your storage account will begin to appear on the graph. The following image shows requests that were authorized with Shared Key or made with a SAS token. Requests are aggregated per day over the past thirty days.

You can also configure an alert rule to notify you when a certain number of requests that are authorized with Shared Key are made against your storage account. For more information, seeCreate, view, and manage metric alerts using Azure Monitor.
Analyze logs to identify clients that are authorizing requests with Shared Key or SAS
Azure Storage logs capture details about requests made against the storage account, including how a request was authorized. You can analyze the logs to determine which clients are authorizing requests with Shared Key or a SAS token.
To log requests to your Azure Storage account in order to evaluate how they are authorized, you can use Azure Storage logging in Azure Monitor. For more information, seeMonitor Azure Storage.
Azure Storage logging in Azure Monitor supports using log queries to analyze log data. To query logs, you can use an Azure Log Analytics workspace. To learn more about log queries, seeTutorial: Get started with Log Analytics queries.
To log Azure Storage data with Azure Monitor and analyze it with Azure Log Analytics, you must first create a diagnostic setting that indicates what types of requests and for which storage services you want to log data. After you configure logging for your storage account, the logs are available in the Log Analytics workspace. To create a workspace, seeCreate a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal.
To learn how to create a diagnostic setting in the Azure portal, seeCreate diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor.
For a reference of fields available in Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor, seeResource logs.
Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor include the type of authorization that was used to make a request to a storage account. To retrieve logs for requests made in the last seven days that were authorized with Shared Key or SAS, open your Log Analytics workspace. Next, paste the following query into a new log query and run it. This query displays the ten IP addresses that most frequently sent requests that were authorized with Shared Key or SAS:
StorageBlobLogs
| where AuthenticationType in ("AccountKey", "SAS") and TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize count() by CallerIpAddress, UserAgentHeader, AccountName
| top 10 by count_ desc
StorageBlobLogs
| where AuthenticationType in ("AccountKey", "SAS") and TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize count() by CallerIpAddress, UserAgentHeader, AccountName
| top 10 by count_ desc
You can also configure an alert rule based on this query to notify you about requests authorized with Shared Key or SAS. For more information, seeCreate, view, and manage log alerts using Azure Monitor.
Remediate authorization via Shared Key
After you have analyzed how requests to your storage account are being authorized, you can take action to prevent access via Shared Key. But first, you need to update any applications that are using Shared Key authorization to use Microsoft Entra ID instead. You can monitor logs and metrics as described inDetect the type of authorization used by client applicationsto track the transition. For more information about using Microsoft Entra ID to access data in a storage account, seeAuthorize access to data in Azure Storage.
When you are confident that you can safely reject requests that are authorized with Shared Key, you can set theAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty for the storage account tofalse.
Warning
If any clients are currently accessing data in your storage account with Shared Key, then Microsoft recommends that you migrate those clients to Microsoft Entra ID before disallowing Shared Key access to the storage account.
Permissions for allowing or disallowing Shared Key access
To set theAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty for the storage account, a user must have permissions to create and manage storage accounts. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) roles that provide these permissions include theMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/writeorMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/*action. Built-in roles with this action include:
The Azure Resource ManagerOwnerrole
The Azure Resource ManagerContributorrole
TheStorage Account Contributorrole
These roles do not provide access to data in a storage account via Microsoft Entra ID. However, they include theMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action, which grants access to the account access keys. With this permission, a user can use the account access keys to access all data in a storage account.
Role assignments must be scoped to the level of the storage account or higher to permit a user to allow or disallow Shared Key access for the storage account. For more information about role scope, seeUnderstand scope for Azure RBAC.
Be careful to restrict assignment of these roles only to those who require the ability to create a storage account or update its properties. Use the principle of least privilege to ensure that users have the fewest permissions that they need to accomplish their tasks. For more information about managing access with Azure RBAC, seeBest practices for Azure RBAC.
Note
The classic subscription administrator roles Service Administrator and Co-Administrator include the equivalent of the Azure Resource ManagerOwnerrole. TheOwnerrole includes all actions, so a user with one of these administrative roles can also create and manage storage accounts. For more information, seeAzure roles, Microsoft Entra roles, and classic subscription administrator roles.
Disable Shared Key authorization
Using an account that has the necessary permissions, disable Shared Key authorization in the Azure portal, with PowerShell or using the Azure CLI.
Azure portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Template
To disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:
Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
Locate theConfigurationsetting underSettings.
Locate theConfigurationsetting underSettings.
SetAllow storage account key accesstoDisabled.
SetAllow storage account key accesstoDisabled.

To disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account with PowerShell, install theAz.Storage PowerShell module, version 3.4.0 or later. Next, configure theAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty for a new or existing storage account.
The following example shows how to disallow access with Shared Key for an existing storage account with PowerShell. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values:
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -AccountName <storage-account> `
    -AllowSharedKeyAccess $false
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -AccountName <storage-account> `
    -AllowSharedKeyAccess $false
To disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account with Azure CLI, install Azure CLI version 2.20.0 or later. For more information, seeInstall the Azure CLI. Next, configure theallowSharedKeyAccessproperty for a new or existing storage account.
The following example shows how to disallow access with Shared Key for an existing storage account with Azure CLI. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values:
az storage account update \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --allow-shared-key-access false
az storage account update \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --allow-shared-key-access false
To disallow Shared Key authorization for a storage account with an Azure Resource Manager template or Bicep file, you can modify the following property:
"allowSharedKeyAccess": false
"allowSharedKeyAccess": false
To learn more, see thestorageAccounts specification.
After you disallow Shared Key authorization, making a request to the storage account with Shared Key authorization will fail with error code 403 (Forbidden). Azure Storage returns an error indicating that key-based authorization is not permitted on the storage account.
TheAllowSharedKeyAccessproperty is supported for storage accounts that use the Azure Resource Manager deployment model only. For information about which storage accounts use the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, seeTypes of storage accounts.
Verify that Shared Key access is not allowed
To verify that Shared Key authorization is no longer permitted, you can query the Azure Storage Account settings with the following command. Replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.
az storage account show \
    --name <storage-account-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --query "allowSharedKeyAccess"
az storage account show \
    --name <storage-account-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --query "allowSharedKeyAccess"
The command returnsfalseif Shared Key authorization is disallowed for the storage account.
Note
Anonymous requests are not authorized and will proceed if you have configured the storage account and container for anonymous read access. For more information, seeConfigure anonymous read access for containers and blobs.
Monitor the Azure Policy for compliance
After disallowing Shared Key access on the desired storage accounts, continue tomonitor the policy you created earlierfor ongoing compliance. Based on the monitoring results, take the appropriate action as needed, including changing the scope of the policy, disallowing Shared Key access on more accounts or allowing it for accounts where more time is needed for remediation.
Update the Azure Policy to prevent allowing Shared Key access
To begin enforcingthe Azure Policy assignment you previously createdfor policyStorage accounts should prevent shared key access, change theEffectof the policy assignment toDenyto prevent authorized users from allowing Shared Key access on storage accounts. To change the effect of the policy, perform the following steps:
On the Azure Policy dashboard, locate and select the policy assignmentyou previously created.
