Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) will be retired onSeptember 30, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by September 30, 2027. For more information, seeAzure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) retirement.
Azure CDN from Edgio was retired onJanuary 15, 2025. For more information, seeAzure CDN from Edgio retirement FAQ.
This tutorial shows how to enable the HTTPS protocol for a custom domain associated with an Azure CDN endpoint.
The HTTPS protocol on your custom domain (for example,https://www.contoso.com), ensures your sensitive data is delivered securely via TLS/SSL. When your web browser is connected via HTTPS, the browser validates the web site's certificate. The browser verifies it's issued by a legitimate certificate authority. This process provides security and protects your web applications from attacks.
https://www.contoso.com
Azure CDN supports HTTPS on a CDN endpoint hostname, by default. For example, if you create a CDN endpoint (such ashttps://contoso.azureedge.net), HTTPS is automatically enabled.
https://contoso.azureedge.net
Some of the key attributes of the custom HTTPS feature are:
No extra cost: There aren't costs for certificate acquisition or renewal and no extra cost for HTTPS traffic. You pay only for GB egress from the CDN.

Disable the HTTPS protocol on your custom domain.
Prerequisites
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Before you can complete the steps in this tutorial, create a CDN profile and at least one CDN endpoint. For more information, seeQuickstart: Create an Azure CDN profile and endpoint.
Associate an Azure CDN custom domain on your CDN endpoint. For more information, seeTutorial: Add a custom domain to your Azure CDN endpoint.
Important
CDN-managed certificates are not available for root or apex domains. If your Azure CDN custom domain is a root or apex domain, you must use the Bring your own certificate feature.
TLS/SSL certificates
To enable HTTPS on an Azure CDN custom domain, you use a TLS/SSL certificate. You choose to use a certificate that is managed by Azure CDN or use your certificate.
Option 1 (default): Enable HTTPS with a CDN-managed certificate
Option 2: Enable HTTPS with your own certificate
Azure CDN handles certificate management tasks such as procurement and renewal. After you enable the feature, the process starts immediately.
If the custom domain is already mapped to the CDN endpoint, no further action is needed. Azure CDN processes the steps and completes your request automatically.
If your custom domain is mapped elsewhere, use email to validate your domain ownership.
To enable HTTPS on a custom domain, follow these steps:
Go to theAzure portalto find a certificate managed by your Azure CDN. Search for and selectCDN profiles.

You can use your own certificate to enable the HTTPS feature. This process is done through an integration with Azure Key Vault, which allows you to store your certificates securely. Azure CDN uses this secure mechanism to get your certificate and it requires a few extra steps. When you create your TLS/SSL certificate, you must create a complete certificate chain with an allowed certificate authority (CA) that is part of theMicrosoft Trusted CA List. If you use a nonallowed CA, your request is rejected. If a certificate without complete chain is presented, requests, which involve that certificate aren't guaranteed to work as expected.
Prepare your Azure Key Vault account and certificate
Azure Key Vault: You must have a running Azure Key Vault account under the same subscription as the Azure CDN profile and CDN endpoints that you want to enable custom HTTPS. Create an Azure Key Vault account if you don't have one.

Validate the domain
If you have a custom domain in use mapped to your custom endpoint with a CNAME record or you're using your own certificate, continue toCustom domain mapped to your Content Delivery Network endpoint.
Otherwise, if the CNAME record entry for your endpoint no longer exists or it contains the cdnverify subdomain, continue toCustom domain not mapped to your CDN endpoint.
Custom domain is mapped to your CDN endpoint by a CNAME record
When you added a custom domain to your endpoint, you created a CNAME record in the DNS domain registrar mapped to your CDN endpoint hostname.
If that CNAME record still exists and doesn't contain the cdnverify subdomain, the DigiCert CA uses it to automatically validate ownership of your custom domain.
If you're using your own certificate, domain validation isn't required.
Your CNAME record should be in the following format:
Nameis your custom domain name.
Valueis your content delivery network endpoint hostname.
For more information about CNAME records, seeCreate the CNAME DNS record.
If your CNAME record is in the correct format, DigiCert automatically verifies your custom domain name and creates a certificate for your domain. DigitCert doesn't send you a verification email and you don't need to approve your request. The certificate is valid for one year and will be autorenewed before it expires. Continue toWait for propagation.
Automatic validation typically takes a few hours. If you don't see your domain validated in 24 hours, open a support ticket.
Note
If you have a Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) record with your DNS provider, it must include the appropriate CAs for authorization. DigiCert is the CA for Azure CDN profiles. For information about managing CAA records, seeManage CAA records. For a CAA record tool, seeCAA Record Helper.
Custom domain isn't mapped to your CDN endpoint
If the CNAME record entry contains the cdnverify subdomain, follow the rest of the instructions in this step.
DigiCert sends a verification email to the following email addresses. Verify that you can approve directly from one of the following addresses:
admin@your-domain-name.com
administrator@your-domain-name.com
webmaster@your-domain-name.com
hostmaster@your-domain-name.com
postmaster@your-domain-name.com
You should receive an email in a few minutes for you to approve the request. In case you're using a spam filter, add verification@digicert.com to its allowlist. If you don't receive an email within 24 hours, contact Microsoft support.

When you select the approval link, you're directed to the following online approval form:

Follow the instructions on the form; you have two verification options:
You can approve all future orders placed through the same account for the same root domain; for example, contoso.com. This approach is recommended if you plan to add other custom domains for the same root domain.
You can approve all future orders placed through the same account for the same root domain; for example, contoso.com. This approach is recommended if you plan to add other custom domains for the same root domain.
You can approve just the specific host name used in this request. Another approval is required for later requests.
You can approve just the specific host name used in this request. Another approval is required for later requests.
After approval, DigiCert completes the certificate creation for your custom domain name. The certificate is valid for one year.  If the CNAME record for your custom domain is added or updated to map to your endpoint hostname after verification, then it will be autorenewed before it's expired.
Note
Managed certificate autorenewal requires that your custom domain be directly mapped to your CDN endpoint by a CNAME record.
Wait for propagation
After the domain name is validated, it can take up to 6-8 hours for the custom domain HTTPS feature to be activated. When the process completes, the custom HTTPS status in the Azure portal is changed toEnabled. The four operation steps in the custom domain dialog are marked as complete. Your custom domain is now ready to use HTTPS.

Operation progress
The following table shows the operation progress that occurs when you enable HTTPS. After you enable HTTPS, four operation steps appear in the custom domain dialog. As each step becomes active, other substep details appear under the step as it progresses. Not all of these substeps occur. After a step successfully completes, a green check mark appears next to it.
* This message doesn't appear unless an error has occurred.
If an error occurs before the request is submitted, the following error message is displayed:
We encountered an unexpected error while processing your HTTPS request. Please try again and contact support if the issue persists.
