Get started withAzure Arc-enabled serversto manage and govern your Windows and Linux machines hosted across on-premises, edge, and multicloud environments.
In this quickstart, you'll deploy and configure the Azure Connected Machine agent on a Windows or Linux machine hosted outside of Azure, so that the machine can be managed through Azure Arc-enabled servers.
While you can repeat the steps in this article as needed to onboard additional machines, we also provide other options for deploying the agent, including several methods designed to onboard machines at scale. For more information, seeAzure Connected Machine agent deployment options.
Tip
If you prefer to try out things in a sample/practice experience, get started quickly withAzure Arc Jumpstart.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Administrator permissions to install and configure the Connected Machine agent.LinuxâUse the root account.WindowsâUse an account that's a member of the Local Administrators group.
LinuxâUse the root account.
WindowsâUse an account that's a member of the Local Administrators group.

Generate installation script
Use the Azure portal to create a script that automates the agent download and installation and establishes the connection with Azure Arc. You'll install this script, in a later step, to the hybrid machine you want to onboard to Azure Arc.
Go to the Azure portal page for adding servers with Azure Arc. Select theAdd a single servertile, then selectGenerate script.TipIn the portal, you can also reach this page by searching for and selecting "Servers - Azure Arc" and then selecting+Add.

Install the agent using the script
Now that you've generated the script, the next step is to run it on the server that you want to onboard to Azure Arc. The script will download the Connected Machine agent from the Microsoft Download Center, install the agent on the server, create the Azure Arc-enabled server resource, and associate it with the agent.
Complete the following steps for the operating system of your server.
Windows agent
Log in to the server.
Log in to the server.
Open an elevated 64-bit PowerShell command prompt.
Open an elevated 64-bit PowerShell command prompt.
Change to the folder or share that you copied the script to, then execute it on the server by running the./OnboardingScript.ps1script.

Linux agent
Install the Linux agent on the target machine in one of the following ways:
On target machines that can directly communicate to Azure, run the following command:bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh
On target machines that can directly communicate to Azure, run the following command:
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh
On target machines that communicate to Azure through a proxy server, run the following command:bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh --proxy "{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}"
On target machines that communicate to Azure through a proxy server, run the following command:
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh --proxy "{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}"
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh --proxy "{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}"
Verify the connection with Azure Arc
After you install the agent and configure it to connect to Azure Arc-enabled servers, go to the Azure portal to verify that the server has successfully connected.
Go to theAzure portal page for hybrid machines.TipYou can also reach this page in the portal by searching for and selecting "Machines - Azure Arc".
Go to theAzure portal page for hybrid machines.
Tip
You can also reach this page in the portal by searching for and selecting "Machines - Azure Arc".
Confirm the machine has a connected status.
Confirm the machine has a connected status.

Next steps
Now that you've enabled your Linux or Windows hybrid machine and successfully connected to the service, you're ready to enable Azure Policy to understand compliance in Azure.
Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources
