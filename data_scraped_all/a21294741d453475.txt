The most common way to analyze and present Prometheus data is with a Grafana dashboard. You can collect Prometheus metrics in Azure in the following ways:
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus
Self-managed Prometheus on Kubernetes clusters
Self-managed Prometheus on Azure virtual machines
Self-managed Prometheus hosted outside of Azure
This article explains how to configure Azure-hosted Prometheus metrics as a data source forAzure Managed Grafana, self-hosted Grafana running on an Azure virtual machine, or a Grafana instance running outside of Azure.
Azure Monitor workspace query endpoint
In Azure, Prometheus data is stored in an Azure Monitor workspace. When configuring the Prometheus data source in Grafana, you use theQuery endpointfor your Azure Monitor workspace. To find the query endpoint, open theOverviewpage for your Azure Monitor workspace in the Azure portal.

Azure Managed Grafana
When you create an Azure Managed Grafana instance, it's automatically configured with a managed system identity. The identity has theMonitoring Data Readerrole assigned to it at the subscription level. This role allows the identity to read data any monitoring data for the subscription. This identity is used to authenticate Grafana to Azure Monitor. You don't need to do anything to configure the identity.
Create the Prometheus data source in Grafana.
To configure Prometheus as a data source, follow these steps:
Open your Azure Managed Grafana workspace in the Azure portal.

Configure Grafana for Azure Authentication
Versions 9.x and greater of Grafana support Azure Authentication, but it's not enabled by default. To enable Azure Authentication, update your Grafana configuration and restart the Grafana instance. To find yourgrafana.inifile, review theConfigure Grafanadocument from Grafana Labs.
grafana.ini
Enable Azure Authentication using the following steps:
Locate and open thegrafana.inifile on your virtual machine.
grafana.ini
Under the[auth]section of the configuration file, change theazure_auth_enabledsetting totrue.
[auth]
azure_auth_enabled
true
Under the[azure]section of the configuration file, change themanaged_identity_enabledsetting totrue
[azure]

true
Restart the Grafana instance.

Grafana hosted outside of Azure
If your Grafana instance isn't hosted in Azure, you can connect to your Prometheus data in your Azure Monitor workspace using Microsoft Entra ID.
Set up Microsoft Entra ID authentication using the following steps:
Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID.
Grant access for the app to your Azure Monitor workspace.
Configure your self-hosted Grafana with the app's credentials.
Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID
To register an app, open the Active Directory Overview page in the Azure portal.
To register an app, open the Active Directory Overview page in the Azure portal.
SelectApp registration.

Configure Grafana for Azure Authentication
Grafana now supports connecting to Azure Monitor managed Prometheus using thePrometheus data source. For self-hosted Grafana instances, a configuration change is needed to use the Azure Authentication option in Grafana. For Grafana instances that aren't managed by Azure, make the following changes:
Versions 9.x and greater of Grafana support Azure Authentication, but it's not enabled by default. To enable Azure Authentication, update your Grafana configuration and restart the Grafana instance. To find yourgrafana.inifile, review theConfigure Grafanadocument from Grafana Labs.
grafana.ini
Locate and open thegrafana.inifile on your virtual machine.

Frequently asked questions
This section provides answers to common questions.
I am missing all or some of my metrics. How can I troubleshoot?
You can use the troubleshooting guide for ingesting Prometheus metrics from the managed agenthere.
Why am I missing metrics that have two labels with the same name but different casing?
Azure managed Prometheus is a case insensitive system. It treats strings, such as metric names, label names, or label values, as the same time series if they differ from another time series only by the case of the string. For more information, seePrometheus metrics overview.
I see some gaps in metric data, why is this occurring?
During node updates, you might see a 1-minute to 2-minute gap in metric data for metrics collected from our cluster level collectors. This gap occurs because the node that the data runs on is being updated as part of a normal update process. This update process affects cluster-wide targets such as kube-state-metrics and custom application targets that are specified. This occurs when your cluster is updated manually or via autoupdate. This behavior is expected and occurs due to the node it runs on being updated. This behavior doesn't affect any of our recommended alert rules.
