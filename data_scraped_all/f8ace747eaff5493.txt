Azure Pipelines provides a fully featured set of CI/CD automation tools for deployments to virtual machines. This article will show you how to set up a classic release pipeline that uses the rolling strategy to deploy your web applications to Linux virtual machines.
Rolling deployments
In each iteration, a rolling deployment replaces instances of an application's previous version. It replaces them with instances of the new version on a fixed set of machines (rolling set). The following walk-through shows how to configure a rolling update to virtual machines.
UsingContinuous-delivery, you can configure rolling updates to your virtual machines within the Azure portal.
[!IMPORTANT] Virtual Machine's Continuous delivery setting will be retired on March 31, 2023.Learn more

If you want to configure multiple VMs, repeat steps 2 through 4 for the other VMs. If you use the same deployment group that already has a configured pipeline, the new VMs will just be added to the deployment group and no new pipelines will be created.

Retirement
Continuous delivery setting of Virtual Machines will be retired on March 31, 2023. Please switch to directly using Azure DevOps to create customized pipelines for deployment to Azure VMs. Release pipelineStage TemplatesandDeployments GroupsAzure DevOps' features provide similar experiences.
Migration Steps
There is no migration required as VM CD experience does not store any information itself, it just helps users with their Day 0 getting started experience on Azure and Azure DevOps. Users will still be able to perform all operations from Azure DevOps after retirement. You won't be able to create and view pipelines from the Azure portal anymore.
FAQ
Where can I set up my CD pipeline after this experience is deprecated?â¯
You won't be able to view or create Azure DevOps pipelines from an Azure portal Virtual Machine blade after retirement. You still can go to Azure DevOps portal and view or update pipelines.
Will I lose my earlier configured pipelines?
No.  Your pipelines will still be available in Azure DevOps.
How can I configure different deployment strategies?
The current experience usesdeployment groupsto create deployment strategies. You can use deployment groups or release pipelineStage Templatesto build your pipeline with templates.
