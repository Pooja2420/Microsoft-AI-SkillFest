Use bulk modify when you need to quickly make the same change to many work items. For example, you might want to change the priority of several bugs or reassign several tasks to the same team member. Use the web portal to quickly modify one or more fields for work items that contain the same value.
Tip
To add work items in bulk or update multiple fields with different values, useCSV Import. You can't complete a bulk add of work items through the web portal.
With bulk modify, you can edit fields and add or remove tags. You can also reassign work or move work to a specific sprint. You can also use bulk modify to change the work item type or move work items to other projects. The options available to you depend on the platform you work from and the permissions assigned to you.

ProvideStakeholder accessto members who want to contribute to the discussion and review progress. These are typically members who don't contribute to code, but want to view work items, backlogs, boards, and dashboards.
By default, allContributorsandStakeholdersin public projects can add new and existing tags. In private projects, Stakeholders can only add existing tags. To control the ability to create new tags, set theCreate tag definitionpermission at the project level. For more information, seeChange project-level permissions.

Note
You can't perform certain functions on work items whosework item typesbelong to thehidden types category. This category includes all work items that track tests (such as test cases, shared steps, and shared parameters), code review requests and responses, and feedback requests and responses.
You can choose to copy or clone a single work item from a query results list or from theActions menu of the work item form. You can only perform a clone or copy action for a single work item. Choose Copy work item when you want to create a copy of a work item and change its work item type. Choose Clone when you want to create another instance of the work item without changes to its work item type.

Edit multiple work items in bulk
To start a bulk edit, begin by multi-selecting the work items you want to modify. Select them from query results or the backlog. You can craft your query using the query editor or search box. For more information, seeDefine a work item query.
Multi-select of work items on the backlog and sprint backlogs works in the same way as multi-select works within query results.
You can use bulk modify by selecting work items from the backlog page or query results list. From the backlog page context menu, change the backlog priority of several items:Change positionorMove to iteration. Then,  assign them to a team member, move them to a different sprint, ormap them to a feature.
The menu options available to you change depending on the platform you work from and whether you work from a backlog page or query results list.

Select multiple items and open the context menu
To select several items in a sequence, select the first item of the sequence, hold downShift, and select the last item of the sequence. To select several nonsequential items, hold downCtrland select the items to be selected one after the other. You can either drag the selected items to a new position within the backlog or to a different sprint if thePlanningside pane is enabled.
Planning
To open the context menu, select () or (), and then choose the option from the menu.
This example uses the context menu to move several nonsequential items to the current sprint.

Tip
Use the backlogCreate Queryfeature to create a query with the backlog items. You can then open the query within the web portal orExcelto perform additional bulk updates.

Reassign work items
With work items selected, open the context menu for any selected item, and reassign all of them. You can assign them to a member of your team or to another sprint or iteration at the same time.

For more information about theAssign ToandIteration Pathfields, seeWorkflow and board fieldsandQuery by area or iteration path.

Edit one or more fields
To assign or modify several fields, chooseEditfrom the context menu of one of the selected work items. Enter a value for each field that you want to update.
For audit purposes, you can add a description for your bulk update task. For more information about each field, see theWork item field index.

From the Query results page, save all work items that you bulk-modified. When you bulk modify items from the backlog, they're automatically saved. Work items shown in bold text indicate that local changes aren't saved to the data store. TheSave itemsbutton might be in a different place in the UI than shown in the following picture, depending on the layout of your browser and the specific version in use.

Move work items to a sprint
From any product, sprint, or portfolio backlog, you can drag a multi-selected list of work items and drop it onto a sprint in thePlanningpane to change its iteration path. This action is not supported for users withStakeholderaccess.
To open thePlanningpane, choose theview options icon and selectPlanning. You can choose to setIn Progress itemstoOnorOff.The set of sprints selected for your team appears.

Modify rich-text fields in bulk
Rich-text fields support entry of HTML syntax tags to support formatting. Rich-text fields correspond to theDescription,Acceptance Criteria,Repos Steps, and others listed inExample queries for select fields.
You can bulk update a rich-text field by using the bulk modify tool, selecting the field, and entering the text with syntax in theValuefield. Or, you can create a work item template with the text you want to use and complete a bulk update by applying the template to the selected work items. For more information, seeUse work item templates.
For an example using templates showing entry of HTML formatted syntax, seeSample work item templates, Add guidance in a rich-text field.

Modify tags in bulk
From theEdit work itemsdialog, selectTags (Add)orTags (Remove).
This example adds theServicetag to the selected work items.

Migrate or change a large number of work items
For large scale, organizational moves, use the REST API calls forWork item batch operations.
At this time, you can't move work items to a different organization or collection. You can only migrate work item information by exporting and then importing them usingExcel.
Add multiple values to a field
If you implemented acustom control that supports multiple values, you can use Excel to bulk edit the field. You can't modify it using the web portal. You can only select a single value for the field.
