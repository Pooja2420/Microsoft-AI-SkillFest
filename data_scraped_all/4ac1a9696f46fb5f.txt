This article describes how to back up Azure VMs with theAzure Backupservice.
Azure Backup provides independent and isolated backups to guard against unintended destruction of the data on your VMs. Backups are stored in a Recovery Services vault with built-in management of recovery points. Configuration and scaling are simple, backups are optimized, and you can easily restore as needed. You can back up Azure VMs using a couple of methods:
Single Azure VM: The instructions in this article describe how to back up an Azure VM directly from the VM settings.
Multiple Azure VMs: You can set up a Recovery Services vault and configure backup for multiple Azure VMs. Follow the instructions inthis articlefor this scenario.

Get an overviewof Azure VM backup.
Azure VM agent installation
To back up Azure VMs, Azure Backup installs an extension on the VM agent running on the machine. If your VM was created from an Azure Marketplace image, the agent will be running. In some cases, for example if you create a custom VM, or you migrate a machine from on-premises, you might need to install the agent manually.
If you do need to install the VM agent manually, follow the instructions forWindowsorLinuxVMs.
After the agent is installed, when you enable backup, Azure Backup installs the backup extension to the agent. It updates and patches the extension without user intervention.
Back up from Azure VM settings
Follow these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In theSearch, typeVirtual machines, and then selectVirtual machines.
From the list of VMs, select the VM you want to back up.
On the VM menu, selectBackup.
InRecovery Services vault, do the following:If you already have a vault, selectSelect existing, and select a vault.If you don't have a vault, selectCreate new. Specify a name for the vault. It's created in the same region and resource group as the VM. You can't modify these settings when you enable backup directly from the VM settings.
If you already have a vault, selectSelect existing, and select a vault.

ForEnhancedpolicy, this backs up a VM every four hours at the time specified and retains daily backup point for 30 days.Select an existing backup policy if you have one.Create a new policy, and define the policy settings.
