Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 is a new generation of an AI-enabled edge computing device offered as a service from Microsoft. This article provides you an overview of the Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 solution. The overview also details the benefits, key capabilities, and the scenarios where you can deploy this device.
The Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 offers the following benefits over its precursor, the Azure Stack Edge Pro series:
This series offers multiple models that closely align with your compute, storage, and memory needs. Depending on the model you choose, the compute acceleration could be via one or two Graphical Processing Units (GPU) on the device.
This series has flexible form factors with multiple mounting options. These devices can be rack mounted, mounted on a wall, or even placed on a shelf in your office.
These devices have low acoustic emissions and meet the requirements for noise levels in an office environment.
Use cases
The Pro 2 series is designed for deployment in edge locations such as retail, telecommunications, manufacturing, or even healthcare. Here are the various scenarios where Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 can be used for rapid Machine Learning (ML) inferencing at the edge and preprocessing data before sending it to Azure.
Inference with Azure Machine Learning- With this solution, you can run ML models to get quick results that can be acted on before the data is sent to the cloud. The full data set can optionally be transferred to continue to retrain and improve your ML models. For more information, see how toDeploy Azure ML hardware accelerated models on Azure Stack Edge.

Preprocess data- Transform data before sending it to Azure via compute options such as containerized workloads and Virtual Machines to create a more actionable dataset. Preprocessing can be used to:Aggregate data.Modify data, for example, to remove personal data.Subset data to optimize storage and bandwidth, or for further analysis.Analyze and react to IoT Events.

Key capabilities
Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 has the following capabilities:
Components
The Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 solution consists of Azure Stack Edge resource, Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 physical device, and a local web UI.
Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 physical device- A compact 2U device supplied by Microsoft that can be configured to send data to Azure.To procure a device, go to the Azure Edge Hardware Center and place an order. Azure Edge Hardware Center service lets you choose from a variety of Azure Stack Edge SKUs as per your business need. You can order multiple units of a device type, ship multiple devices to different locations, save addresses for future orders, and also track the status of your orders.Once the order is delivered, you can configure your device and create an Azure Stack Edge resource to manage the device.For more information, go toCreate an order for your Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 device.

Azure Stack Edge resource- A resource in the Azure portal that lets you manage an Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 device from a web interface that you can access from different geographical locations. Use the Azure Stack Edge resource to create and manage resources, view, and manage devices and alerts, and manage shares.

Region availability
The Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 physical device, Azure resource, and target storage account to which you transfer data donât all have to be in the same region.
Resource availability- For this release, the resource is available in East US, West EU, and South East Asia regions.

Destination Storage accounts- The storage accounts that store the data are available in all Azure regions. The regions where the storage accounts store Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 data should be located close to where the device is located for optimum performance. A storage account located far from the device results in long latencies and slower performance.
