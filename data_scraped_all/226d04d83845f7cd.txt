Azure Data Factory Documentation
Azure Data Factory is Azure's cloud ETL service for scale-out serverless data integration and data transformation.  It offers a code-free UI for intuitive authoring and single-pane-of-glass monitoring and management. You can also lift and shift existing SSIS packages to Azure and run them with full compatibility in ADF. SSIS Integration Runtime offers a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about infrastructure management.
