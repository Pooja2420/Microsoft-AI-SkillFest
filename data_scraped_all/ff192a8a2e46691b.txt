On September 30, 2025, Basic SKU public IPs will be retired. For more information, see theofficial announcement. If you are currently using Basic SKU public IPs, make sure to upgrade to Standard SKU public IPs prior to the retirement date. For guidance on upgrading, visitUpgrading a basic public IP address to Standard SKU - Guidance.
Learn about a public IP address and how to create, change, and delete one. A public IP address is a resource with configurable settings.
When you assign a public IP address to an Azure resource, you enable the following operations:
Inbound communication from the Internet to the resource, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), Azure Application Gateways, Azure Load Balancers, Azure VPN Gateways, and others.

Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Create a public IP address
For instructions on how to create public IP addresses using the Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Resource Manager templates, refer to the following pages:
Create a public IP address - Azure portal
Create a public IP address - Azure portal
Create a public IP address - PowerShell
Create a public IP address - PowerShell
Create a public IP address - Azure CLI
Create a public IP address - Azure CLI
Create a public IP address - Template
Create a public IP address - Template
Note
The portal provides the option to create an IPv4 and IPv6 address concurrently during resource deployment. The PowerShell and Azure CLI commands create one resource, either IPv4 or IPv6. If you want an IPv4 and a IPv6 address, execute the PowerShell or CLI command twice. Specify different names and IP versions for the public IP address resources.
For more detail on the specific attributes of a public IP address during creation, see the following table:

Warning
Remove the address from any applicable IP configurations (seeDeletesection) to change assignment for a public IP from static to dynamic. When you change the assignment method from static to dynamic, you lose the IP address that was assigned to the public IP resource. While the Azure public DNS servers maintain a mapping between static or dynamic addresses and any DNS name label (if you defined one), a dynamic IP address can change when the virtual machine is started after being in the stopped (deallocated) state. To prevent the address from changing, assign a static IP address.
Delete: Deletion of public IPs requires that the public IP object isn't associated to any IP configuration or virtual machine network interface. For more information, see the following table.
--public-ip-address
Virtual Machine Scale Sets
There aren't separate public IP objects associated with the individual virtual machine instances for a Virtual Machine Scale Set with public IPs. A public IP prefix objectcan be used to generate the instance IPs.
To list the Public IPs on a Virtual Machine Scale Set, you can use PowerShell (Get-AzPublicIpAddress -VirtualMachineScaleSetName) or CLI (az Virtual Machine Scale Set list-instance-public-ips).
For more information, seeNetworking for Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

Region availability
Azure Public IP is available in all regions for both Public and US Gov clouds. Azure Public IP doesn't move or store customer data out of the region it's deployed in.
Permissions
To manage public IP addresses, your account must be assigned to thenetwork contributorrole. Acustomrole is also supported. The custom role must be assigned the appropriate actions listed in the following table:
