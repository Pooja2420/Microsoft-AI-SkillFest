This article shows you how to peer an Azure Databricks virtual network (VNet) with an Azure VNet.
Overview of virtual network (VNet) peering
The default deployment of Azure Databricks is a fully managed service on Azure. Classic compute plane resources are deployed in a managed Azure Databricks virtual network (VNet). You can also choose to deploy Azure Databricks in your Azure virtual network (also known as VNet injection), seeDeploy Azure Databricks in your Azure virtual network (VNet injection).
VNet peering allows the virtual network that your Azure Databricks workspace is running to peer with another Azure virtual network. For an overview of Azure VNet peering, seeMicrosoft Azure Virtual network peering.
You can peer a managed Azure Databricks VNet to another to an Azure VNet or you can peer your own Azure VNet (in a VNet-injected workspace) to another to an Azure VNet.
Traffic between virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is always over the Azure network backbone and not the public internet.
Peer an Azure Databricks virtual network to another Azure virtual network
In the Azure portal, find the Azure Databricks workspace service.
In theSettingssection of the sidebar, clickVirtual Network Peering.
Click+ Add peering.
Enter a name.
Depending on the information you have about the remote virtual network, do one of the following:If you know the resource ID of the remote virtual network:Select theI know my Resource IDcheckbox.In theResource IDtext box, paste in the remote virtual network resource ID.If you know the name of the remote virtual network:In theSubscriptiondrop-down, select a subscription.In theVirtual networkdrop-down, select the remote virtual network.
If you know the resource ID of the remote virtual network:Select theI know my Resource IDcheckbox.In theResource IDtext box, paste in the remote virtual network resource ID.
Select theI know my Resource IDcheckbox.
In theResource IDtext box, paste in the remote virtual network resource ID.
If you know the name of the remote virtual network:In theSubscriptiondrop-down, select a subscription.In theVirtual networkdrop-down, select the remote virtual network.
In theSubscriptiondrop-down, select a subscription.
In theVirtual networkdrop-down, select the remote virtual network.
Specify the configuration of the remote virtual network. SeeCreate a peeringfor information about the configuration fields.
ClickAdd.
To confirm that the peering is deployed and connected, go to the Azure Databricks workspace resource in the Azure portal, selectVirtual Network Peerings, and verify that the peeringâs status isConnected.
Peer your own virtual network to another Azure virtual network
You can deploy Azure Databricks in your Azure virtual network (also known as VNet injection). To set up VNet peering in a VNet-injected workspace, configure the peering in the virtual network you deployed Azure Databricks in. SeeCreate, change, or delete a virtual network peering.
Connect an on-premises virtual network to an Azure virtual network
To connect an on-premises network to an Azure VNet, follow the steps inConnect an on-premises network to Azure using ExpressRoute.
To create a site-to-site VPN gateway connection from your on-premises network to an Azure VNet, follow the steps inCreate a Site-to-Site connection in the Azure portal.
