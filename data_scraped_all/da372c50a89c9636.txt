The retention policy controls the mechanism that automatically removes data from tables ormaterialized views. It's useful to remove data that continuously flows into a table, and whose relevance is age-based. For example, the policy can be used for a table that holds diagnostics events that may become uninteresting after two weeks.
The retention policy can be configured for a specific table or materialized view, or for an entire database. The policy then applies to all tables in the database that don't override it. When the policy is configured both at the database and table level, the retention policy in the table takes precedence over the database policy.
Setting up a retention policy is important when continuously ingesting data, which will limit costs.
Data that is "outside" the retention policy is eligible for removal. There's no specific guarantee when removal occurs. Data may "linger" even if the retention policy is triggered.
The retention policy is most commonly set to limit the age of the data since ingestion. For more information, seeSoftDeletePeriod.
Note
The deletion time is imprecise. The system guarantees that data won't be
deleted before the limit is exceeded, but deletion isn't immediate following that point.
A soft-delete period of 0 can be set as part of a table-level retention policy, but not as part of a database-level retention policy.
When this is done, the ingested data won't be committed to the source table, avoiding the need to persist the data. As a result,Recoverabilitycan only be set toDisabled.
Recoverability
Disabled
Such a configuration is useful mainly when the data gets ingested into a table.
A transactionalupdate policyis used to transform it and redirect the output into another table.
The retention policy on amaterialized viewaffects only the view, not the source table. The source data remains unaffected.
The policy object
A retention policy includes the following properties:
SoftDeletePeriod:Time span for which it's guaranteed that the data is kept available to query. The period is measured starting from the time the data was ingested.Defaults to1,000 years.When altering the soft-delete period of a table or database, the new value applies to both existing and new data.
Time span for which it's guaranteed that the data is kept available to query. The period is measured starting from the time the data was ingested.
Defaults to1,000 years.
1,000 years
When altering the soft-delete period of a table or database, the new value applies to both existing and new data.
Recoverability:Data recoverability (Enabled/Disabled) after the data was deleted.Defaults toEnabled.If set toEnabled, the data will be recoverable for 14 days after it's been soft-deleted.It is not possible to configure the recoverability period.
Data recoverability (Enabled/Disabled) after the data was deleted.
Defaults toEnabled.
Enabled
If set toEnabled, the data will be recoverable for 14 days after it's been soft-deleted.
Enabled
It is not possible to configure the recoverability period.
Note
Data that is deleted usingsoft deleteorpurgeis not recoverable regardless of any retention or recoverability settings.
Management commands
Use.show policy retentionto show the current retention policy for a database, table, ormaterialized view.
.show policy retention
Use.alter policy retentionto change current retention policy of a database, table, ormaterialized view.
.alter policy retention
Defaults
By default, when a database or a table is created, it doesn't have a retention policy defined. Normally, the database is created and then immediately has its retention policy set by its creator according to known requirements.
When you run a.showcommandfor the retention policy of a database or table that hasn't had its policy set,Policyappears asnull.
.show
Policy
null
The default retention policy, with the default values mentioned above, can be applied using the following command.
.alter database DatabaseName policy retention "{}"
.alter table TableName policy retention "{}"
.alter materialized-view ViewName policy retention "{}"
.alter database DatabaseName policy retention "{}"
.alter table TableName policy retention "{}"
.alter materialized-view ViewName policy retention "{}"
The command results in the following policy object applied to the database or table.
{
  "SoftDeletePeriod": "365000.00:00:00", "Recoverability":"Enabled"
}
{
  "SoftDeletePeriod": "365000.00:00:00", "Recoverability":"Enabled"
}
Clearing the retention policy of a database or table can be done using the following command.
.delete database DatabaseName policy retention
.delete table TableName policy retention
.delete database DatabaseName policy retention
.delete table TableName policy retention
Examples
For an environment that has a database namedMyDatabase, with tablesMyTable1,MyTable2, andMySpecialTable.
