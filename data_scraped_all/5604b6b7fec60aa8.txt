For Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes or dual-protocol volumes with theUnixsecurity style, you have the option to set theUnix permissionsand thechange ownership mode(Chown Mode) options. You can specify these settings during volume creation or after volume creation.

Chown Mode
Unix permissions
The Azure NetApp FilesUnix Permissionsfunctionality enables you to specify change permissions for the mount path. The setting does not apply to the files under the mount path.
The Unix permissions setting is set to0770by default. This default setting grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner and the group, but no permissions are granted to other users.
0770
You can specify a custom Unix permissions value (for example,0755) to give the desired permission to the owner, group, or other users.
0755
Change ownership mode
The change ownership mode (Chown Mode) functionality enables you to set the ownership management capabilities of files and directories.  You can specify or modify the setting under a volume's export policy. Two options forChown Modeare available:
Chown Mode
Chown Mode
Restricted(default) - Only the root user can change the ownership of files and directories.
Restricted
Unrestricted- Non-root users can change the ownership for files and directories that they own.
Unrestricted
Considerations
The Unix permissions you specify apply only for the volume mount point (root directory).
You can modify the Unix permissions on the source volumebut not on the destination volumethat is in a cross-region replication configuration.
Steps
You can specify theUnix permissionsand change ownership mode (Chown Mode) settings under theProtocoltab when youcreate an NFS volumeorcreate a dual-protocol volume.The following example shows the Create a Volume screen for an NFS volume.

For existing NFS or dual-protocol volumes, you can set or modifyUnix permissionsandchange ownership modeas follows:To modify Unix permissions, right-click thevolume, and selectEdit. In the Edit window that appears, specify a value forUnix Permissions.To modify the change ownership mode, click thevolume, clickExport policy, then modify theChown Modesetting.
