Azure security baseline for Azure Cosmos DB
Article

In this article
This security baseline applies guidance from theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark version 1.0to Azure Cosmos DB. The Microsoft cloud security benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the security controls defined by the Microsoft cloud security benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Cosmos DB.
You can monitor this security baseline and its recommendations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Azure Policy definitions will be listed in the Regulatory Compliance section of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal page.
When a feature has relevant Azure Policy Definitions, they are listed in this baseline to help you measure compliance with the Microsoft cloud security benchmark controls and recommendations. Some recommendations may require a paid Microsoft Defender plan to enable certain security scenarios.
Note
Featuresnot applicable to Azure Cosmos DB have been excluded. To see how Azure Cosmos DB completely maps to the Microsoft cloud security benchmark, see thefull Azure Cosmos DB security baseline mapping file.
Security profile
The security profile summarizes high-impact behaviors of Azure Cosmos DB, which may result in increased security considerations.
Network security
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Network security.

Identity management
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Identity management.
IM-1: Use centralized identity and authentication system
Description: Service supports using Azure AD authentication for data plane access.Learn more.
Feature notes: Azure AD authentication is only supported on the Core (SQL) API. Other APIs only support key-based authentication.
Configuration Guidance: There is no current Microsoft guidance for this feature configuration. Please review and determine if your organization wants to configure this security feature.
Reference:Configure role-based access control with Azure Active Directory for your Azure Cosmos DB account
Description: Local authentications methods supported for data plane access, such as a local username and password.Learn more.
Feature notes: Avoid the usage of local authentication methods or accounts, these should be disabled wherever possible. Instead use Azure AD to authenticate where possible.
Configuration Guidance: No additional configurations are required as this is enabled on a default deployment.

Azure Policy built-in definitions - Microsoft.DocumentDB:
IM-3: Manage application identities securely and automatically
Description: Data plane actions support authentication using managed identities.Learn more.
Feature notes: Azure AD authentication is only supported on the Core (SQL) API.
Configuration Guidance: There is no current Microsoft guidance for this feature configuration. Please review and determine if your organization wants to configure this security feature.
Reference:Configure managed identities with Azure Active Directory for your Azure Cosmos DB account
Description: Data plane supports authentication using service principals.Learn more.
Feature notes: Azure AD authentication is only supported by the Core (SQL) API.
Configuration Guidance: There is no current Microsoft guidance for this feature configuration. Please review and determine if your organization wants to configure this security feature.

IM-7: Restrict resource access based on conditions
Description: Data plane access can be controlled using Azure AD Conditional Access Policies.Learn more.
Feature notes: Conditional access policies are supported where Azure AD authentication is used. Azure AD authentication is only supported on the Core (SQL) API.
Configuration Guidance: There is no current Microsoft guidance for this feature configuration. Please review and determine if your organization wants to configure this security feature.
IM-8: Restrict the exposure of credential and secrets
Description: Data plane supports native use of Azure Key Vault for credential and secrets store.Learn more.
Feature notes: Cosmos DB can use primary/secondary keys (shared secrets) to control access to data. Integration of these secrets into Key Vault is not supported directly by Cosmos DB, but custom client code that uses shared secrets can use Key Vault if desired.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
Privileged access
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Privileged access.
PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege) principle
Description: Azure Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC) can be used to managed access to service's data plane actions.Learn more.
Configuration Guidance: There is no current Microsoft guidance for this feature configuration. Please review and determine if your organization wants to configure this security feature.
Reference:Configure role-based access control with Azure Active Directory for your Azure Cosmos DB account
PA-8: Determine access process for cloud provider support
Description: Customer Lockbox can be used for Microsoft support access.Learn more.
Feature notes: Lockbox can't be implemented on Azure Cosmos DB due to the multi-tenant nature of the service.
Configuration Guidance: This feature is not supported to secure this service.
Data protection
For more information, see theMicrosoft cloud security benchmark: Data protection.
DP-1: Discover, classify, and label sensitive data
Description: Tools (such as Azure Purview or Azure Information Protection) can be used for data discovery and classification in the service.Learn more.
