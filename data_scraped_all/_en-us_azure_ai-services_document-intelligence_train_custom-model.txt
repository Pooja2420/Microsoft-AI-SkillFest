Document Intelligence uses advanced machine learning technology to identify documents, detect and extract information from forms and documents, and return the extracted data in a structured JSON output. With Document Intelligence, you can use document analysis models, pre-built/pre-trained, or your trained standalone custom models.
Custom models now includecustom classification modelsfor scenarios where you need to identify the document type before invoking the extraction model. Classifier models are available starting with the2023-07-31 (GA)API. A classification model can be paired with a custom extraction model to analyze and extract fields from forms and documents specific to your business. Standalone custom extraction models can be combined to createcomposed models.

Custom document model types
Custom document models can be one of two types,custom templateor custom form andcustom neuralor custom document models. The labeling and training process for both models is identical, but the models differ as follows:
Custom extraction models
To create a custom extraction model, label a dataset of documents with the values you want extracted and train the model on the labeled dataset. You only need five examples of the same form or document type to get started.
Custom neural model
Important
Document Intelligencev4.0 2024-11-30 (GA)API supports custom neural modeloverlapping fields,signature detectionandtable, row and cell level confidence.
v4.0 2024-11-30 (GA)
The custom neural (custom document) model uses deep learning models and  base model trained on a large collection of documents. This model is then fine-tuned or adapted to your data when you train the model with a labeled dataset. Custom neural models support extracting key data fields from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents. When you're choosing between the two model types, start with a neural model to determine if it meets your functional needs. With V4.0, custom neural model supports signature detection, table confidence and overlapping fields. Seeneural modelsto learn more about custom document models.
Custom template model
The custom template or custom form model relies on a consistent visual template to extract the labeled data. Variances in the visual structure of your documents affect the accuracy of your model. Structured  forms such as questionnaires or applications are examples of consistent visual templates.
Your training set consists of structured documents where the formatting and layout are static and constant from one document instance to the next. Custom template models support key-value pairs, selection marks, tables, signature fields, and regions. Template models and can be trained on documents in any of thesupported languages. For more information,seecustom template models.
If the language of your documents and extraction scenarios supports custom neural models, we recommend that you use custom neural models over template models for higher accuracy.
Tip
To confirm that your training documents present a consistent visual template, remove all the user-entered data from each form in the set. If the blank forms are identical in appearance, they represent a consistent visual template.
For more information,seeInterpret and improve accuracy and confidence for custom models.

Optimal training data
Training input data is the foundation of any machine learning model. It determines the quality, accuracy, and performance of the model. Therefore, it's crucial to create the best training input data possible for your Document Intelligence project. When you use the Document Intelligence custom model, you provide your own training data. Here are a few tips to help train your models effectively:
Use text-based instead of image-based PDFs when possible. One way to identify an image*based PDF is to try selecting specific text in the document. If you can select only the entire image of the text, the document is image based, not text based.

Consider segmenting your dataset into folders, where each folder is a unique template. Train one model per folder, and compose the resulting models into a single endpoint. Model accuracy can decrease when you have different formats analyzed with a single model.

Build mode
Thebuild custom modeloperation adds support for thetemplateandneuralcustom models. Previous versions of the REST API and client libraries only supported a single build mode that is now known as thetemplatemode.

Template models only accept documents that have the same basic page structureâa uniform visual appearanceâor the same relative positioning of elements within the document.

Neural models support documents that have the same information, but different page structures. Examples of these documents include United States W2 forms, which share the same information, but vary in appearance across companies.

Custom classification model
Document classification is a new scenario supported by Document Intelligence with the2023-07-31(v3.1 GA) API. The document classifier API supports classification and splitting scenarios. Train a classification model to identify the different types of documents your application supports. The input file for the classification model can contain multiple documents and classifies each document within an associated page range. To learn more,seecustom classificationmodels.

Custom model tools
Document Intelligence v3.1 and later models support the following tools, applications, and libraries, programs, and libraries:
Custom model life cycle
The life cycle of a custom model depends on the API version that is used to train it. If the API version is a general availability (GA) version, the custom model has the same life cycle as that version. The custom model isn't available for inference when the API version is deprecated. If the API version is a preview version, the custom model has the same life cycle as the preview version of the API.
Document Intelligence v2.1 supports the following tools, applications, and libraries:
