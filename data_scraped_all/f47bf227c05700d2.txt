Note
This article applies to Azure DevOps Server (on-premises). To manage access levels for Azure DevOps Services (cloud), seeAdd users to your organization or project.
Access levels manage access to use the functions and features that Azure DevOps Server provides. Access levels are in addition to permissions granted through security groups, which provide or restrict specific tasks. In this article, learn how to change access levels for users and groups. For more information, seeAbout access levels.
For a simplified overview of the permissions that are assigned to the most common groupsâReaders, Contributors, and Project Administratorsâand the Stakeholder access group, seePermissions and access.

Prerequisites
Open access levels
You can manage access levels for the collections defined on the application tier. The default access level affects all the projects in all the collections. When you add users or groups to teams, projects, or collections, they get the default access level. To give a different access level to a certain user or group, you need to add them to a non-default access level.
From the web portal home page for a project collection (for example,http://MyServer:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/), openAccess levels. If you're at a project level, choose theAzure DevOps logo and then chooseAccess levels.If you don't seeAccess levels, you aren't an administrator and need toget permission.

Change the access level for a user or group
To assign a different access level to a user or group, you need to first delete their current access level and then grant them the new one.
Make sure to set each user's access level based on what you've purchased for that user. Basic access includes all Stakeholder features - Basic + Test Plans. Advanced and Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber access levels include all Basic features.

Change the default access level
Make sure the default access level is the same as the access you're licensed for. When you set the default access level to Stakeholder, only the users who are given the Basic or a higher level can access more features than the Stakeholder level.
You can set an access level from its page. ChooseSet as default access levelas shown.

Important
Service accounts get added to the default access level. If you set Stakeholder as the default access level, you must add the Azure DevOps service accounts to the Basic or an advanced access level group.
