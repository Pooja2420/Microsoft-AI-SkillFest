The authentication process begins when a claimant asserts its control of one of more authenticators associated with a subscriber. The subscriber is a person or another entity. Use the following table to learn about National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) authenticator types and associated Microsoft Entra authentication methods.

Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) SMS/Voice are not recommended
NIST does not recommend SMS or voice. The risks of device swap, SIM changes, number porting, and other behaviors can cause issues. If these actions are malicious, they can result in an insecure experience. Although SMS/Voice are not recommended, they are better than using only a password, because they require more effort for hackers.
