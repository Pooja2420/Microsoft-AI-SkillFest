Disable SMB 1 on Linux clients

Many organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) block the port that SMB uses to communicate, port 445. This practice originates from security guidance about legacy and deprecated versions of the SMB protocol. Although SMB 3.x is an internet-safe protocol, older versions of SMB, especially SMB 1, aren't. SMB 1, also known as CIFS (Common Internet File System), is included with many Linux distributions.
SMB 1 is an outdated, inefficient, and insecure protocol. The good news is that Azure Files doesn't support SMB 1. Also, starting with Linux kernel version 4.18, Linux makes it possible to disable SMB 1. Westrongly recommenddisabling the SMB 1 on your Linux clients before using SMB file shares in production.
Caution
This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that will no longer be supported after June 2024. Please consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see theCentOS End Of Life guidance.
Linux distribution status
Starting with Linux kernel 4.18, the SMB kernel module, calledcifsfor legacy reasons, exposes a new module parameter (often referred to asparmby various external documentation) calleddisable_legacy_dialects. Although introduced in Linux kernel 4.18, some vendors have backported this change to older kernels that they support. The following table details the availability of this module parameter on common Linux distributions.
cifs
disable_legacy_dialects
You can check to see if your Linux distribution supports thedisable_legacy_dialectsmodule parameter via the following command:
disable_legacy_dialects
sudo modinfo -p cifs | grep disable_legacy_dialects
sudo modinfo -p cifs | grep disable_legacy_dialects
This command should output the following message:
disable_legacy_dialects: To improve security it may be helpful to restrict the ability to override the default dialects (SMB2.1, SMB3 and SMB3.02) on mount with old dialects (CIFS/SMB1 and SMB2) since vers=1.0 (CIFS/SMB1) and vers=2.0 are weaker and less secure. Default: n/N/0 (bool)
disable_legacy_dialects: To improve security it may be helpful to restrict the ability to override the default dialects (SMB2.1, SMB3 and SMB3.02) on mount with old dialects (CIFS/SMB1 and SMB2) since vers=1.0 (CIFS/SMB1) and vers=2.0 are weaker and less secure. Default: n/N/0 (bool)
Remove SMB 1
Before disabling SMB 1, confirm that the SMB module isn't currently loaded on your system (which happens automatically if you've mounted an SMB share). Run the following command, which should output nothing if SMB isn't loaded:
lsmod | grep cifs
lsmod | grep cifs
To unload the module, first unmount all SMB shares using theumountcommand. You can identify all the mounted SMB shares on your system with the following command:
umount
mount | grep cifs
mount | grep cifs
Once you've unmounted all SMB file shares, it's safe to unload the module. Run themodprobecommand:
modprobe
sudo modprobe -r cifs
sudo modprobe -r cifs
You can manually load the module with SMB 1 unloaded using themodprobecommand:
modprobe
sudo modprobe cifs disable_legacy_dialects=Y
sudo modprobe cifs disable_legacy_dialects=Y
Finally, you can check the SMB module has been loaded with the parameter by looking at the loaded parameters in/sys/module/cifs/parameters:
/sys/module/cifs/parameters
cat /sys/module/cifs/parameters/disable_legacy_dialects
cat /sys/module/cifs/parameters/disable_legacy_dialects
To persistently disable SMB 1 on Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, you must create a new file (if you don't already have custom options for other modules) called/etc/modprobe.d/local.confwith the setting. Run the following command:
/etc/modprobe.d/local.conf
echo "options cifs disable_legacy_dialects=Y" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf > /dev/null
echo "options cifs disable_legacy_dialects=Y" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf > /dev/null
You can verify that this has worked by loading the SMB module:
sudo modprobe cifs
cat /sys/module/cifs/parameters/disable_legacy_dialects
sudo modprobe cifs
cat /sys/module/cifs/parameters/disable_legacy_dialects
