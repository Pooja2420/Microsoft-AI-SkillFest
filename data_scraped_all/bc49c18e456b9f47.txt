In this article, learn how to deploy Arc-enabled VMware vSphere for Azure VMware Solution private cloud. Once you set up the components needed, you're ready to execute operations in Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server from the Azure portal. Arc-enabled Azure VMware Solution allows you to do the following actions:
Identify your VMware vSphere resources (VMs, templates, networks, datastores, clusters/hosts/resource pools) and register them with Arc at scale.
Perform different virtual machine (VM) operations directly from Azure like; create, resize, delete, and power cycle operations (start/stop/restart) on VMware VMs consistently with Azure.
Permit developers and application teams to use VM operations on-demand withRole-based access control.
Install the Arc-connected machine agent togovern, protect, configure, and monitorthem.
Browse your VMware vSphere resources (vms, templates, networks, and storage) in Azure
Deployment considerations
When you run software in Azure VMware Solution, as a private cloud in Azure, there are benefits not realized by operating your environment outside of Azure. For software running in a virtual machine (VM) like, SQL Server and Windows Server, running in Azure VMware Solution provides more value such as free Extended Security Updates (ESUs).
To take advantage of the benefits of running in an Azure VMware Solution, use this article to enable Arc and fully integrate the experience with the Azure VMware Solution private cloud. Alternatively, Arc-enabling VMs through the following mechanisms won't create the necessary attributes to register the VM and software as part of Azure VMware Solution and will result in billing for SQL Server ESUs for:
Arc-enabled servers
Arc-enabled VMware vSphere
SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc
Deploy Arc
The following requirements must be met in order to use Azure Arc-enabled Azure VMware Solution.
Prerequisites
The following Register features are for provider registration using Azure CLI.
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ConnectedVMwarevSphere   
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation  
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration   
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ResourceConnector    
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.AVS
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ConnectedVMwarevSphere   
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation  
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration   
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ResourceConnector    
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.AVS
Alternately, you can sign in to your Subscription and follow these steps.
Navigate to the Resource providers tab.
Register the resource providers mentioned above.
Important
You can't create the resources in a separate resource group. Ensure you use the same resource group from where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud was created to create your resources.
You need the following items to ensure you're set up to begin the onboarding process to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution.
Validate the regional support before you start the onboarding process. Arc for Azure VMware Solution is supported in all regions where Arc for VMware vSphere on-premises is supported. For details, seeAzure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere.
Amanagement VMwith internet access that has a direct line of site to the vCenter Server.
From the Management VM, verify you  have access tovCenter Server and NSX Manager portals.
A resource group in the subscription where you have an owner or contributor role.
An unused,NSX network segmentthat is a static network segment used for deploying the Arc for Azure VMware Solution OVA. If an unused NSX network segment doesn't exist, one gets created.
The firewall and proxy URLs must be allowlisted to enable communication from the management machine and Appliance VM to the required Arc resource bridge URLs. See theAzure Arc resource bridge network requirements.
Verify your vCenter Server version is 7.0 or higher.
A resource pool or a cluster with a minimum capacity of 16 GB of RAM and four vCPUs.
A datastore with a minimum of 100 GB of free disk space is available through the resource pool or cluster.
Note
Private endpoint is currently not supported.
DHCP support isn't available to customers at this time, only static IP addresses are currently supported.
If you want to use a custom DNS, use the following steps:
In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, navigate to the DNS page, underWorkload networking, select **DNS, and identify the default forwarder-zones under theDNS zonestab.
Edit the forwarder zone to add the custom DNS server IP. By adding the custom DNS as the first IP, it allows requests to be directly forwarded to the first IP and decreases the number of retries.
Onboard process to deploy Azure Arc
Use the following steps to guide you through the process to onboard Azure Arc for Azure VMware Solution.

Important
After the successful installation of Azure Arc Resource Bridge, it's recommended to retain a copy of the resource bridge config.yaml files in a place that facilitates easy retrieval. These files could be needed later to run commands to perform management operations (e.g.az arcappliance upgrade) on the resource bridge. You can find the three .yaml files (config files) in the same folder where you ran the script.
When the script is run successfully, check the status to see if Azure Arc is now configured. To verify if your private cloud is Arc-enabled, do the following actions:
In the left navigation, locateOperations.
ChooseAzure Arc.
Azure Arc state shows asConfigured.
To recover from failed deployments:
If the Azure Arc resource bridge deployment fails, consult theAzure Arc resource bridge troubleshootingguide. While there can be many reasons why the Azure Arc resource bridge deployment fails, one of them is KVA timeout error. Learn more about theKVA timeout errorand how to troubleshoot.
Discover and project your VMware vSphere infrastructure resources to Azure
When Arc appliance is successfully deployed on your private cloud, you can do the following actions.
View the status from within the private cloud left navigation underOperations > Azure Arc.
View the VMware vSphere infrastructure resources from the private cloud left navigation underPrivate cloudthen selectAzure Arc vCenter Server resources.
Discover your VMware vSphere infrastructure resources and project them to Azure by navigating,Private cloud > Arc vCenter Server resources > Virtual Machines.
Similar to VMs, customers can enable networks, templates, resource pools, and data-stores in Azure.
Enable virtual machines, resource pools, clusters, hosts, datastores, networks, and VM templates in Azure
Once you connected your Azure VMware Solution private cloud to Azure, you can browse your vCenter Server inventory from the Azure portal. This section shows you how to make these resources Azure enabled.
Note
Enabling Azure Arc on a VMware vSphere resource is a read-only operation on vCenter Server. It doesn't make changes to your resource in vCenter Server.
On your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, in the left navigation, locatevCenter Server Inventory.
Select the resources you want to enable, then selectEnable in Azure.
Select your AzureSubscriptionandResource Group, then selectEnable.
The enable action starts a deployment and creates a resource in Azure, creating representative objects in Azure for your VMware vSphere resources. It allows you to manage who can access those resources through Role-based access control granularly.
Repeat the previous steps for one or more virtual machine, network, resource pool, and VM template resources.
Additionally, for virtual machines there's an another section to configureVM extensions.  This enables guest management to facilitate more Azure extensions to be installed on the VM. The steps to enable this would be:
SelectEnable guest management.
Choose aConnectivity Methodfor the Arc agent.
Provide an Administrator/Root access username and password for the VM.
If you choose to enable the guest management as a separate step or have issues with the VM extension install steps, review the prerequisites and steps discussed in the following section.
Enable guest management and extension installation
Before you install an extension, you must enable guest management on the VMware VM.
Prerequisite
Before you can install an extension, ensure your target machine meets the following conditions:
Is running asupported operating system.
Is able to connect through the firewall to communicate over the internet and theseURLsaren't blocked.
Has VMware tools installed and running.
Is powered on and the resource bridge has network connectivity to the host running the VM.
Is Enabled in Azure.
Enable guest management
You need to enable guest management on the VMware VM before you can install an extension. Use the following steps to enable guest management.
Navigate toAzure portal.
From the left navigation, locatevCenter Server Inventoryand chooseVirtual Machinesto view the list of VMs.
Select the VM you want to install the guest management agent on.
SelectEnable guest managementand provide the administrator username and password to enable guest management then selectApply.
Locate the VMware vSphere VM you want to check for guest management and install extensions on, select the name of the VM.
SelectConfigurationfrom the left navigation for a VMware VM.
VerifyEnable guest managementis now checked.
From here more extensions can be installed. See theVM extensions Overviewfor a list of current extensions.
Manually integrate an Arc-enabled VM into Azure VMware Solutions
When a VM in Azure VMware Solution private cloud is Arc-enabled using a method distinct from the one outlined in this document, the following steps are provided to refresh the integration between the Arc-enabled VMs and Azure VMware Solution.
These steps change the VM machine type fromMachine â Azure Arcto typeMachine â Azure Arc (AVS),which has the necessary integrations with Azure VMware Solution.
There are two ways to refresh the integration between the Arc-enabled VMs and Azure VMware Solution:
In the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, navigate to the vCenter Server inventory and Virtual Machines section within the portal. Locate the virtual machine that requires updating and follow the process to 'Enable in Azure'. If the option is grayed out, you must firstRemove from Azureand then proceed toEnable in Azure
In the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, navigate to the vCenter Server inventory and Virtual Machines section within the portal. Locate the virtual machine that requires updating and follow the process to 'Enable in Azure'. If the option is grayed out, you must firstRemove from Azureand then proceed toEnable in Azure
Run theaz connectedvmware vm createAzure CLI command on the VM in Azure VMware Solution to update the machine type.
