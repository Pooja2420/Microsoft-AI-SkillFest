This article helps you understand billing and resource management scopes available in Azure and how to use the scopes in Cost Management and APIs.
Scopes
Ascopeis a node in the Azure resource hierarchy where Microsoft Entra users access and manage services. Most Azure resources are created and deployed into resource groups, which are part of subscriptions. Microsoft also offers two hierarchies above Azure subscriptions that have specialized roles to manage billing data:
Billing data, such as payments and invoices
Cloud services, such as cost and policy governance
Scopes are where you manage billing data, have roles specific to payments, view invoices, and conduct general account management. Billing and account roles are managed separately from roles used for resource management, which useAzure RBAC. To clearly distinguish the intent of the separate scopes, including the access control differences, they're referred to asbilling scopesandAzure RBAC scopes, respectively.
To learn more about scopes, watch theCost Management setting up hierarchiesvideo. To watch other videos, visit theCost Management YouTube channel.
Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, seeNew name for Azure AD.
How Cost Management uses scopes
Cost Management works at all scopes above resources to allow organizations to manage costs at the level at which they have access, whether that's the entire billing account or a single resource group. Although billing scopes differ based on your Microsoft agreement (subscription type), the Azure RBAC scopes don't.
Azure RBAC scopes
Azure supports three scopes for resource management. Each scope supports managing access and governance, including but not limited to, cost management.
Management groups- Hierarchical containers, used to organize Azure subscriptions. A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. The limit doesn't include the Root level or the subscription level.Resource type:Microsoft.Management/managementGroups

Resource type:Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups
Management groups allow you to organize subscriptions into a hierarchy. For example, you might create a logical organization hierarchy using management groups. Then, give teams subscriptions for production and dev/test workloads. And then create resource groups in the subscriptions to manage each subsystem or component.
Creating an organizational hierarchy allows cost and policy compliance to roll up organizationally. Then, each leader can view and analyze their current costs. And then they can create budgets to curb bad spending patterns and optimize costs with Advisor recommendations at the lowest level.
Granting access to view costs and optionally manage cost configuration, such as budgets and exports, is done on governance scopes using Azure RBAC. You use Azure RBAC to grant Microsoft Entra users and groups access to do a predefined set of actions. The actions are defined in a role on a specific scope and lower. For instance, a role assigned to a management group scope also grants the same permissions to nested subscriptions and resource groups.
Cost Management supports the following built-in roles for each of the following scopes:
Ownerâ Can view costs and manage everything, including cost configuration.
Contributorâ Can view costs and manage everything, including cost configuration, but excluding access control.
Readerâ Can view everything, including cost data and configuration, but can't make any changes.
Cost Management Contributorâ Can view costs, manage cost configuration, and view recommendations.
Cost Management Readerâ Can view cost data, cost configuration, and view recommendations.
Cost Management Contributor is the recommended least-privilege role. The role allows people to create and manage budgets and exports to more effectively monitor and report on costs. Cost Management Contributors might also require more roles to support complex cost management scenarios. Consider the following scenarios:
Reporting on resource usageâ Cost Management shows cost in the Azure portal. It includes usage as it pertains to cost in the full usage patterns. This report can also show API and download charges, but you may also want to drill into detailed usage metrics in Azure Monitor to get a deeper understanding. Consider grantingMonitoring Readeron any scope where you also need to report detailed usage metrics.
Act when budgets are exceededâ Cost Management Contributors also need access to create and manage action groups to automatically react to overages. Consider grantingMonitoring Contributorto a resource group that contains the action group to use when budget thresholds are exceeded. Automating specific actions requires more roles for the specific services used, such as Automation and Azure Functions.
Schedule cost data exportâ Cost Management Contributors also need access to manage storage accounts to schedule an export to copy data into a storage account. Consider grantingStorage Account Contributorto a resource group that contains the storage account where cost data is exported.
Viewing cost-saving recommendationsâ Cost Management Readers and Cost Management Contributors have access toviewcost recommendations by default. However, access to act on the cost recommendations requires access to individual resources. Consider granting aservice-specific roleif you want to act on a cost-based recommendation.
Note
Management groups aren't currently supported in Cost Management features for Microsoft Customer Agreement subscriptions. TheCost Details APIalso doesn't support management groups for either EA or MCA customers.
Management groups are only supported if they contain up to 3,000 Enterprise Agreement (EA), Pay-as-you-go (PAYG), or Microsoft internal subscriptions. Management groups with more than 3,000 subscriptions or subscriptions with other offer types, like Microsoft Customer Agreement or Microsoft Entra subscriptions, can't view costs.
If you have a mix of subscriptions, move the unsupported subscriptions to a separate arm of the management group hierarchy to enable Cost Management for the supported subscriptions. As an example, create two management groups under the root management group:Microsoft Entra IDandMy Org. Move your Microsoft Entra subscription to theMicrosoft Entra IDmanagement group and then view and manage costs using theMy Orgmanagement group.
Managed resource groups
Managed resource groups created by certain resource providers - such as Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) or Azure Databricks - can't be used as scopes for Cost Management features like budgets or exports. These resource groups typically include deny assignments that restrict modifications to protect critical resources, which can result in authorization errors. For more information on deny assignments, please refer toList Azure deny assignments.
To avoid these issues, use a higher-level scope such as the subscription scope which contains this managed resource group when configuring budgets or exports.
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Read â View exports
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Read â View exports
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Write â Create or update exports
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Write â Create or update exports
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Delete â Delete exports
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Delete â Delete exports
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Action â Run export
Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/Action â Run export
Note: Deny assignments can result in permission errors, so please check even with these permissions if there are any deny assignments at this scope.
Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/Read â View budgets
Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/Read â View budgets
Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/Write â Create or update budgets
Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/Write â Create or update budgets
Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/Delete â Delete budgets
Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/Delete â Delete budgets
(Optional) Microsoft.Insights/actionGroups/Read â If action groups are configured for alerts
(Optional) Microsoft.Insights/actionGroups/Read â If action groups are configured for alerts
Note: Deny assignments can result in permission errors, so please check even with these permissions if there are any deny assignments at this scope.
Feature behavior for each role
The following table shows how Cost Management features are used by each role. The following behavior is applicable to all Azure RBAC scopes.
Enterprise Agreement scopes
Enterprise Agreement (EA) billing accounts, also called enrollments, have the following scopes:
Billing account- Represents an EA enrollment. Invoices are generated at this scope. Purchases that aren't usage-based, such as Marketplace and reservations, are only available at this scope. They aren't represented in departments or enrollment accounts. Reservation usage, along with all other usage, is applied to individual resources. Usage rolls-up to subscriptions within the billing account. To see reservation costs broken down to each resource, switch to viewAmortized costin cost analysis.Resource type:Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts (accountType = Enrollment)

Although governance scopes are bound to a single directory, EA billing scopes aren't. An EA billing account may have subscriptions across any number of Microsoft Entra directories.
EA billing scopes support the following roles:
Enterprise adminâ Can manage billing account settings and access, can view all costs, and can manage cost configuration. For example, budgets and exports.
Enterprise read-only userâ Can view billing account settings, cost data, and cost configuration. Can manage budgets and exports.
Department adminâ Can manage department settings, such as cost center, and can access, view all costs, and manage cost configuration. For example, budgets and exports.  TheDA view chargesbilling account setting must be enabled for department admins and read-only users to see costs. IfDA view chargesoption is disabled, department users can't see costs at any level, even if they're an account or subscription owner.
Department read-only userâ Can view department settings, cost data, and cost configuration. Can manage budgets and exports. IfDA view chargesoption is disabled, department users can't see costs at any level, even if they're an account or subscription owner.
Account ownerâ Can manage enrollment account settings (such as cost center), view all costs, and manage cost configuration (such as budgets and exports) for the enrollment account. TheAO view chargesbilling account setting must be enabled for account owners and Azure RBAC users to see costs.
EA billing account users don't have direct access to invoices. Invoices are available from an external volume licensing system.
Azure subscriptions are nested under enrollment accounts. Billing users have access to cost data for the subscriptions and resource groups that are under their respective scopes. They don't have access to see or manage resources in the Azure portal. Users can view costs by navigating toCost Management + Billingin the Azure portal list of services. Then, they can filter costs to the specific subscriptions and resource groups they need to report on.
Billing users don't have access to management groups because they don't fall explicitly under a specific billing account. Access must be granted to management groups explicitly. Management groups roll-up costs from all nested subscriptions. However, they only include usage-based purchases. They don't include purchases such as reservations and third-party Marketplace offerings. To view these costs, use the EA billing account.
Feature behavior for each role
The following tables show how Cost Management features can be utilized by each role.
Individual agreement scopes
Azure subscriptions created from individual offers like pay-as-you-go and related types like Free Trial and dev/test offers, don't have an explicit billing account scope. Instead, each subscription has an account owner or account admin, like the EA account owner.
Billing account-
Represents a single account owner for one or more Azure subscriptions. It doesn't currently support granting access to multiple people or access to aggregated cost views.Resource type: Not applicable

Resource type: Not applicable
Individual Azure subscription account admins can view and manage billing data, such as invoices and payments, from theAzure portal>Subscriptions> select a subscription.
Unlike EA, individual Azure subscription account admins can see their invoices in the Azure portal. Keep in mind that Cost Management Reader and Cost Management Contributor roles don't provide access to invoices. For more information, seeHow to grant access to invoices.
Microsoft Customer Agreement scopes
Microsoft Customer Agreement billing accounts have the following scopes:
Billing account- Represents a customer agreement for multiple Microsoft products and services. Customer Agreement billing accounts aren't functionally the same as EA enrollments. EA enrollments are more closely aligned to billing profiles.Resource type:Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts (accountType = Organization)

Resource type:Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts (accountType = Organization)
Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts (accountType = Organization)
Billing profile- Defines the subscriptions that are included in an invoice. Billing profiles are the functional equivalent of an EA enrollment, since that's the scope that invoices are generated at. Similarly, purchases that aren't usage-based (such as Marketplace and reservations) are only available at this scope. They aren't included in invoice sections.Resource type:Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/billingProfiles

Unlike EA billing scopes, Customer Agreement billing accountsaremanaged by a single directory. Microsoft Customer Agreement billing accounts can havelinkedsubscriptions that could be in different Microsoft Entra directories.
Customer Agreement billing scopes don't apply to partners. Partner roles and permissions are documented atAssign users roles and permissions.
Customer Agreement billing scopes support the following roles:
Ownerâ Can manage billing settings and access, view all costs, and manage cost configuration. For example, budgets and exports. In function, this Customer Agreement billing scope is the same as theCost Management Contributor Azure role.
Contributorâ Can manage billing settings except access, view all costs, and manage cost configuration. For example, budgets and exports. In function, this Customer Agreement billing scope is the same as theCost Management Contributor Azure role.
Readerâ Can view billing settings, cost data, and cost configuration. Can manage budgets and exports.
Invoice managerâ Can view and pay invoices and can view cost data and configuration. Can manage budgets and exports.
Azure subscription creatorâ Can create Azure subscriptions, view costs, and manage cost configuration. For example, budgets and exports. In function, this Customer Agreement billing scope is the same as the EA enrollment account owner role.
Azure subscriptions are nested under invoice sections, like how they are under EA enrollment accounts. Billing users have access to cost data for the subscriptions and resource groups that are under their respective scopes. However, they don't have access to see or manage resources in the Azure portal. Billing users can view costs by navigating toCost Management + Billingin the Azure portal list of services. Then, filter costs to the specific subscriptions and resource groups they need to report on.
Note
Management group scopes aren't supported for Microsoft Customer Agreement accounts at this time.
Billing users don't have access to management groups because they don't explicitly fall under the billing account. However, when management groups are enabled for the organization, all subscription costs are rolled-up to the billing account and to the root management group because they're both constrained to a single directory. Management groups only include purchases that are usage-based. Purchases like reservations and third-party Marketplace offerings aren't included in management groups. So, the billing account and root management group may report different totals. To view these costs, use the billing account or respective billing profile.
Feature behavior for each role
The following tables show how Cost Management features can be utilized by each role.
Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) scopes
The following scopes are supported for CSPs with customers on a Microsoft Customer Agreement:
Billing account- Represents a customer agreement for multiple Microsoft products and services. Customer Agreement billing accounts aren't functionally the same as EA enrollments. EA enrollments are more closely aligned to billing profiles.Resource type:Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts (accountType = Organization)

Only the users withAdmin agentandbilling adminroles can manage and view costs for billing accounts, billing profiles, and customers directly in the partner's Azure tenant. For more information about partner center roles, seeAssign users roles and permissions.
Cost Management only supports CSP partner customers if the customers have a Microsoft Customer Agreement. For CSP supported customers who aren't yet on a Microsoft Customer Agreement, seePartner Center.
Management groups in CSP scopes aren't supported by Cost Management. If you have a CSP subscription and you set the scope to a management group in cost analysis, an error similar the following one is shown:
Management group <ManagementGroupName> does not have any valid subscriptions
Management group <ManagementGroupName> does not have any valid subscriptions
Switch between scopes in Cost Management
All Cost Management views in the Azure portal include aScopeselection pill at the top-left of the view. Use it to quickly change scope. Select theScopepill to open the scope picker. It shows billing accounts, the root management group, and any subscriptions that aren't nested under the root management group. To select a scope, select the background to highlight it, and then selectSelectat the bottom. To drill-in to nested scopes, like resource groups in a subscription, select the scope name link. To select the parent scope at any nested level, selectSelect this <scope>at the top of the scope picker.
