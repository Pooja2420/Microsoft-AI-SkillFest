The Microsoft Azure Data Box cloud solution lets you send terabytes of data into and out of Azure in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device. These storage devices come in two variations having a maximum usable storage capacity of 120 TB and 525 TB respectively. These are transported to your data center through a regional carrier. These devices have a rugged casing to protect and secure data during the transit.
Note
The Azure Data Box 80TB device will be retired on May 31, 2025 in the US, EU, UK, Canada, and US Gov regions. After this date, new orders for this device will no longer be accepted. However, we'll continue to process and support all existing orders. The Azure Data Box service will transition to using the Next-gen Azure Data Box 120, Azure Data Box 525, Azure Data Box Disk, and Azure Import/Export service for all offline data transfer needs in these regions.

Each storage device has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 TB and is transported to your datacenter through a regional carrier. The device has a rugged casing to protect and secure data during the transit.
You can order the Data Box device via the Azure portal to import or export data from Azure. Once the device is received, you can quickly set it up using the local web UI. Depending on whether you will import or export data, copy the data from your servers to the device or from the device to your servers, and ship the device back to Azure. If importing data to Azure, in the Azure datacenter, your data is automatically uploaded from the device to Azure. The entire process is tracked end-to-end by the Data Box service in the Azure portal.
Use cases
Data Box is ideally suited to transfer data sizes larger than 40 TBs in scenarios with no to limited network connectivity. The data movement can be one-time, periodic, or an initial bulk data transfer followed by periodic transfers.
Data Box is ideally suited for importing data to Azure in several scenarios, including the following:
Onetime migration- when a large amount of on-premises data is moved to Azure.Moving a media library from offline tapes into Azure to create an online media library.Migrating your VM farm, SQL server, and applications to Azure.Moving historical data to Azure for in-depth analysis and reporting using HDInsight.

Moving historical data to Azure for in-depth analysis and reporting using HDInsight.
Initial bulk transfer- when an initial bulk transfer is done using Data Box (seed) followed by incremental transfers over the network.For example, backup solutions partners such as Commvault and Data Box are used to move initial large historical backup to Azure. Once complete, the incremental data is transferred via network to Microsoft Azure Storage.

Data Box can be used to export data from Azure in several scenarios, including the following:
Disaster recovery- when a copy of the data from Azure is restored to an on-premises network. In a typical disaster recovery scenario, a large amount of Azure data is exported to a Data Box. Microsoft then ships this Data Box, and the data is restored on your premises in a short time.

Security requirements- when you need to be able to export data out of Azure due to government or security requirements. For example, Azure Storage is available in US Secret and Top Secret clouds, and you can use Data Box to export data out of Azure.

Ingestion of data from Data Box
Azure providers and non-Azure providers can ingest data from Azure Data Box. The Azure services that provide data ingestion from Azure Data Box include:
SharePoint Online- use Azure Data Box and the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) to migrate your file share content to SharePoint Online. Using Data Box, you remove the dependency on your WAN link to transfer the data. For more information, seeUse the Azure Data Box Heavy to migrate your file share content to SharePoint Online.

Features and specifications
The Data Box device has the following features in this release.
Important
Data Box Next Gen 120TB and 525TB devices use QSFP28 cables. SFP+/SFP28 cables used with the original 80TB devices cannot be inserted directly into Data Box Next Gen devices without an appropriate adapter.

Next generation Data Box performance improvements
The new version offers enhanced performance for data ingestion and upload, making it easier and faster for enterprise customers to migrate large-scale data to Azure without needing extensive on-premises network infrastructure. Key advancements include-
NVMe devices offer faster data transfer rates, with copy speeds up to 7GBps via SMB Direct on RDMA (100-GbE) for medium to large files, a 10x improvement in device transfers as compared to previous generation devices.
There is significant performance improvement within the data copy service, ranging from 2x for small sized files (64K-512K), to up to 7x for large files (8 MB to 128 MB). The data copy service runs locally on the Data Box, connects to the userâs network-attached storage (NAS) device via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, and copies data to Data Box. This eliminates the need for an intermediate host to ingest data.
High-speed transfers to Azure with data upload up to 5x faster for medium to large files, minimizing the lead time for your data to become accessible in the Azure cloud.
These improvements are achieved through optimized hardware and software stacks, including the use of RDMA for SMB, which collectively reduces CPU usage and enhance overall efficiency.

Cross-region data transfer for Data Box devices
Direct upload from any source to any Azure destination region
Customers can now select a given source to any Azure destination region for a direct upload from the DataBox device. This capability allows you to copy your data from a local source and transfer it to a destination within a different country, region, or boundary. For example, data stored on-premises in a source country like India can be directly uploaded to an Azure region in a different country, such as the United States. This feature provides flexibility and convenience for organizations with distributed data storage needs. It's important to note that the DataBox device isn't shipped across commerce boundaries. Instead, it's transported to an Azure data center within the originating country or region. Data transfer between the source country and the destination region takes place using the Azure network and incurs no additional cost.
Benefits
This capability is particularly useful for large distributed organizations that have their Azure workloads set up in multiple regions. It allows for seamless data transfer across regions without the need for intermediate steps. Additionally, customers are not charged for the transcontinental transfer, making it a cost-effective solution for global data management.
Exceptions and limitations
Customers should be aware of the following exceptions and limitations when planning their data transfer strategies:
Cross-cloud transfers are not supported. Data cannot be transferred between different cloud providers.
Shipping the Data Box device itself across commerce boundaries is not supported.
Some data transfer scenarios take place over large geographic areas. Higher than normal latencies might be encountered during such transfers.
Data resiliency
The Data Box service is geographical in nature and has a single active deployment in one region within each country or commerce boundary. For data resiliency, a passive instance of the service is maintained in a different region, usually within the same country or commerce boundary. In a few cases, the paired region is outside the country or commerce boundary.
In the extreme event of any Azure region being affected by a disaster, the Data Box service will be made available through the corresponding paired region. Both ongoing and new orders will be tracked and fulfilled through the service via the paired region. Failover is automatic, and is handled by Microsoft.
For regions paired with a region within the same country or commerce boundary, no action is required. Microsoft is responsible for recovery, which could take up to 72 hours.
For regions that donât have a paired region within the same geographic or commerce boundary, the customer will be notified to create a new Data Box order from a different, available region and copy their data to Azure in the new region. New orders would be required for the Brazil South, Southeast Asia, and East Asia regions.
