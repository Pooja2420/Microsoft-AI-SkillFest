Azure Blob Storage
Reference

Connect to Azure Blob Storage.
This article describes the operations for the Azure Blob Storagebuilt-inconnector, which is availableonlyfor Standard workflows in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. If you're looking for the Azure Blob Storagemanagedconnector operations instead, seeAzure Blob Storage managed connector reference.
Built-in connector settings
In a Standard logic app resource, the Azure Blob Storage built-in connector includes settings that control various thresholds for performance, timeout, execution time, and so on. For example, you can change the timeout value for blob storage requests from the Azure Logic Apps runtime. For more information, reviewReference for host settings - host.json - Blob storage.
