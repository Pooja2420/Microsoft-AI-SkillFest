Within a Conditional Access policy, an administrator can use one or more signals to enhance their policy decisions.

Multiple conditions can be combined to create fine-grained and specific Conditional Access policies.
When users access a sensitive application, an administrator might factor multiple conditions into their access decisions, such as:
Sign-in risk information from ID Protection
Network location
Device information
User risk
Administrators with access toID Protectioncan evaluate user risk as part of a Conditional Access policy. User risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised. More information about user risk is found in the articlesWhat is riskandHow To: Configure and enable risk policies.
Sign-in risk
Administrators with access toID Protectioncan evaluate sign-in risk as part of a Conditional Access policy. Sign-in risk represents the probability that a given authentication request wasn't made by the identity owner. More information about sign-in risk is found in the articlesWhat is riskandHow To: Configure and enable risk policies.
Insider risk
Administrators with access toMicrosoft Purview adaptive protectioncan incorporate risk signals from Microsoft Purview into Conditional Access policy decisions. Insider risk takes into account your data governance, data security, and risk and compliance configurations from Microsoft Purview. These signals are based on contextual factors like:
User behavior
Historical patterns
Anomaly detections
This condition lets administrators use Conditional Access policies to take actions like blocking access, requiring stronger authentication methods, or requiring terms of use acceptance.
This functionality involves incorporating parameters that specifically address potential risks arising from within an organization. By configuring Conditional Access to consider Insider Risk, administrators can tailor access permissions based on contextual factors such as user behavior, historical patterns, and anomaly detection.
For more information, see the articleConfigure and enable an insider risk based policy.
Device platforms
Conditional Access identifies the device platform by using information provided by the device, such as user agent strings. Since user agent strings can be modified, this information is unverified. Use of device platform should be pared with Microsoft Intune device compliance policies or as part of a block statement. The default is to apply to all device platforms.
Conditional Access supports the following device platforms:
Android
iOS
Windows
macOS
Linux
If you block legacy authentication using theOther clientscondition, you can also set the device platform condition.
Selecting macOS or Linux device platforms isn't supported when selectingRequire approved client apporRequire app protection policyas the only grant controls or when you chooseRequire all the selected controls.
Important
Microsoft recommends having a Conditional Access policy for unsupported device platforms. For example, to block access to your corporate resources fromChrome OSor any other unsupported clients, configure a policy with a Device platforms condition that includes any device and excludes supported device platforms and Grant control set to Block access.
Locations
The locations condition moved.
Client apps
By default, all newly created Conditional Access policies apply to all client app types even if the client apps condition isnât configured.
Note
The behavior of the client apps condition was updated in August 2020. If you have existing Conditional Access policies, they remain unchanged. However, if you select an existing policy, theConfiguretoggle is removed and the client apps the policy applies to are selected.
Important
Sign-ins from legacy authentication clients donât support multifactor authentication (MFA) and donât pass device state information, so they're blocked by Conditional Access grant controls, like requiring MFA or compliant devices. If you have accounts which must use legacy authentication, you must either exclude those accounts from the policy, or configure the policy to only apply to modern authentication clients.
TheConfiguretoggle when set toYesapplies to checked items, when set toNoit applies to all client apps, including modern and legacy authentication clients. This toggle doesnât appear in policies created before August 2020.

These conditions are commonly used to:
Require a managed device
Block legacy authentication
Block web applications but allow mobile or desktop apps
Supported browsers
This setting works with all browsers. However, to satisfy a device policy, like a compliant device requirement, the following operating systems and browsers are supported. Operating Systems and browsers out of mainstream support arenât shown on this list:
These browsers support device authentication, allowing the device to be identified and validated against a policy. The device check fails if the browser is running in private mode or if cookies are disabled.
Note
Microsoft Edge 85+ requires the user to be signed in to the browser to properly pass device identity. Otherwise, it behaves like Chrome without theMicrosoft Single Sign On extension. This sign-in might not occur automatically in a hybrid device join scenario.
Safari is supported for device-based Conditional Access on a managed device, but it can't satisfy theRequire approved client apporRequire app protection policyconditions. A managed browser like Microsoft Edge satisfies approved client app and app protection policy requirements.
On iOS with non-Microsoft MDM solutions, only the Microsoft Edge browser supports device policy.
Firefox 91+is supported for device-based Conditional Access, but "Allow Windows single sign-on for Microsoft, work, and school accounts" needs to be enabled.
Chrome 111+is supported for device-based Conditional Access, but "CloudApAuthEnabled" needs to be enabled.
macOS devices using the Enterprise SSO plugin require theMicrosoft Single Sign Onextension to support SSO and device-based Conditional Access in Google Chrome.
macOS devices using the Firefox browser must be running macOS version 10.15 or newer and have theMicrosoft Enterprise SSO plug-in installedandconfigured appropriately.
On Windows 7, iOS, Android, and macOS devices are identified using a client certificate. This certificate is provisioned when the device is registered. When a user first signs in through the browser the user is prompted to select the certificate. The user must select this certificate before using the browser.
For Chrome support inWindows 10 Creators Update (version 1703)or later, install theMicrosoft Single Sign Onextension or enable Chrome'sCloudAPAuthEnabled. These configurations are required when a Conditional Access policy requires device-specific details for Windows platforms specifically.
To automatically enable the CloudAPAuthEnabled policy in Chrome, create the following registry key:
Path:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome
Name:CloudAPAuthEnabled
CloudAPAuthEnabled
Value:0x00000001
0x00000001
PropertyType:DWORD
DWORD
To automatically deploy the Microsoft Single Sign On extension to Chrome browsers, create the following registry key using theExtensionInstallForcelistpolicy in Chrome:
Path:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallForcelist

macOS devices using the Enterprise SSO plugin require theMicrosoft Single Sign Onextension to support SSO and device-based Conditional Access in Google Chrome.
For MDM based deployments of Google Chrome and extension management, refer toSet up Chrome browser on MacandExtensionInstallForcelist.
Supported mobile applications and desktop clients
Administrators can selectMobile apps and desktop clientsas client app.
This setting has an effect on access attempts made from the following mobile apps and desktop clients:
Exchange ActiveSync clients
Administrators can only select Exchange ActiveSync clients when assigning policy to users or groups. SelectingAll users,All guest and external users, orDirectory rolescauses all users to be subject of the policy.
When administrators create a policy assigned to Exchange ActiveSync clients,Exchange Onlineshould be the only cloud application assigned to the policy.
Administrators can narrow the scope of this policy to specific platforms using theDevice platformscondition.
If the access control assigned to the policy usesRequire approved client app, the user is directed to install and use the Outlook mobile client. In the case thatMultifactor authentication,Terms of use, orcustom controlsare required, affected users are blocked, because basic authentication doesnât support these controls.
For more information, see the following articles:
Block legacy authentication with Conditional Access
Requiring approved client apps with Conditional Access
Other clients
By selectingOther clients, you can specify a condition that affects apps that use basic authentication with mail protocols like IMAP, MAPI, POP, SMTP, and older Office apps that don't use modern authentication.
Device state (deprecated)
This condition was deprecated.Customers should use theFilter for devicescondition in the Conditional Access policy, to satisfy scenarios previously achieved using the device state condition.
Important
Device state and filters for devices can't be used together in Conditional Access policy. Filters for devices provide more granular targeting including support for targeting device state information through thetrustTypeandisCompliantproperty.
trustType
isCompliant
Filter for devices
When administrators configure filter for devices as a condition, they can include or exclude devices based on a filter using a rule expression on device properties. The rule expression for filter for devices can be authored using rule builder or rule syntax. This experience is similar to the one used for rules for dynamic membership groups. For more information, see the articleConditional Access: Filter for devices.
Authentication flows (preview)
Authentication flows control how your organization uses certain authentication and authorization protocols and grants. These flows might provide a seamless experience to devices that might lack local input devices like shared devices or digital signage. Use this control to configure transfer methods likedevice code flow or authentication transfer.
