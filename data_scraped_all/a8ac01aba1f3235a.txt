Azure Dedicated Host SKUs are the combination of a VM family and a certain hardware specification. You can only deploy VMs of the VM series that the Dedicated Host SKU specifies. For example, on the Dsv3-Type3, you can only provisionDsv3-seriesVMs.
This document goes through the hardware specifications and VM packings for all general purpose Dedicated Host SKUs.
Limitations
The sizes and hardware types available for dedicated hosts vary by region. Refer to the hostpricing pageto learn more.
