Important
The Azure AI Content Safety models for protected material, groundedness detection, and custom categories (standard) work with English only.
Other Azure AI Content Safety models have been specifically trained and tested on the following languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese. However, these features can work in many other languages, but the quality might vary. In all cases, you should do your own testing to ensure that it works for your application.
Note
Language auto-detection
You don't need to specify a language code for text moderation or Prompt Shields. The service automatically detects your input language.
