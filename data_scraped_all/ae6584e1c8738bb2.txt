Azure AI Content Safety is an AI service that detects harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. The interactive Content Safety Studio allows you to view, explore, and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities.
Content filtering software can help your app comply with regulations or maintain the intended environment for your users.
This documentation contains the following article types:
Conceptsprovide in-depth explanations of the service functionality and features.
Quickstartsare getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.
How-to guidescontain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.
Where it's used
The following are a few scenarios in which a software developer or team would require a content moderation service:
User prompts submitted to a generative AI service.
Content produced by generative AI models.
Online marketplaces that moderate product catalogs and other user-generated content.
Gaming companies that moderate user-generated game artifacts and chat rooms.
Social messaging platforms that moderate images and text added by their users.
Enterprise media companies that implement centralized moderation for their content.
K-12 education solution providers filtering out content that is inappropriate for students and educators.
Important
You cannot use Azure AI Content Safety to detect illegal child exploitation images.
Product features
This service makes several different types of analysis available. The following table describes the currently available APIs.
Content Safety Studio
Azure AI Content Safety Studiois an online tool designed to handle potentially offensive, risky, or undesirable content using cutting-edge content moderation ML models. It provides templates and customized workflows, enabling users to choose and build their own content moderation system. Users can upload their own content or try it out with provided sample content.
Content Safety Studio not only contains out-of-the-box AI models but also includesMicrosoft's built-in terms blockliststo flag profanities and stay up to date with new content trends. You can also upload your own blocklists to enhance the coverage of harmful content that's specific to your use case.
Studio also lets you set up amoderation workflow, where you can continuously monitor and improve content moderation performance. It can help you meet content requirements from all kinds of industries like gaming, media, education, E-commerce, and more. Businesses can easily connect their services to the Studio and have their content moderated in real-time, whether user-generated or AI-generated.
All of these capabilities are handled by the Studio and its backend; customers donât need to worry about model development. You can onboard your data for quick validation and monitor your KPIs accordingly, like technical metrics (latency, accuracy, recall), or business metrics (block rate, block volume, category proportions, language proportions, and more). With simple operations and configurations, customers can test different solutions quickly and find the best fit, instead of spending time experimenting with custom models or doing moderation manually.

Security

Microsoft Entra ID or Managed Identity
For enhanced security, you can use Microsoft Entra ID or Managed Identity (MI) to manage access to your resources.
Managed Identity is automatically enabled when you create a Content Safety resource.
Microsoft Entra ID is supported in both API and SDK scenarios. Refer to the general AI services guideline ofAuthenticating with Microsoft Entra ID. You can also grant access to other users within your organization by assigning them the roles ofCognitive Services UsersandReader. To learn more about granting user access to Azure resources using the Azure portal, refer to theRole-based access control guide.
Encryption of data at rest
Encryption
Learn how Azure AI Content Safety handles theencryption and decryption of your data. Customer-managed keys (CMK), also known as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK), offer greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. You can also audit the encryption keys used to protect your data.
