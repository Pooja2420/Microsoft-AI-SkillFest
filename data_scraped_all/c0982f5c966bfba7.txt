Several tools support copy, clone, or import operations of test items such as test plans, test suites, and test cases. Test cases describe the steps to take to run a test and validate a feature implementation or bug fix. Test suites group test cases, and optionally other test suites, into a particular order. Test plans define a collection of test suites to run for a particular iteration or release.
Each test case is designed to confirm a specific behavior. Test cases might belong to one or more test suites, however test suites can belong to one and only one test plan.
In general, you should create a test plan for every major project milestone. Copy, clone, or import operations of test items support the following scenarios.
Define a test plan for a new sprint or release based on an existing test plan
Import test suites from one test plan to another test plan within the same or different project
Copy test cases for use in different test suites and test plans
Share test objects across projects
Move test objects from one project to another, possibly to support consolidating projects into a single project
For more information, seeOverview of test objects and terms.

Note
With the release of Azure DevOps Server 2020, the web portal for Azure Test Plans was significantly updated. Many new features were added to support copy, clone, import, and export. For an overview, seeNavigate Test Plans.
The Test Case Management (TCM) command-line tool is installed when you install Visual Studio 2017 or earlier versions. Examples provided in this article reflect the options available with the Visual Studio 2017 version. Earlier versions may support fewer options. For details, seeWork with the TCM command-line tool.
REST API commands to support cloning of test plans and test suites were added with version 5.0, corresponding with Azure DevOps 2019.
List test plans or test suites
When you perform copy, clone, or import operations related to test plans or test suites, itâs essential to have access to their unique ID. This identifier allows you to precisely target the specific plan or suite you want to work with. By knowing the assigned ID, you can streamline your testing processes and ensure accurate replication or transfer of test-related data.
Browser
TCM CLI

Do the following steps to generate a list of test plans, test suites, or other test objects.
SelectBoards>Queries, from your project.
Enter the parameter,Work Item Type=Test Planin your query Editor. You can list all test plans defined for the team project.
Work Item Type=Test Plan
Enter a check in theQuery across projectscheckbox.
The query lists all test plans defined for all projects. For more information, seeDefine a work item query.
Runthe query.
Tip
While test plans, test suites, and test cases are related to each other, you can't view the relationships through a work item query. Link types don't link test plans, test suites, and test cases. Only shared steps and shared parameters link to test cases. Also, test cases link to user stories or other work items that they test.


TCM supports listing of test plans and test suites. Lists specify the work ID for each test plan or test suite. This ID is the same as a plan ID or suite ID.

Copy or clone test plans
When you create a new test plan per sprint or release, a helpful approach is to clone the test plan from the prior cycle. With minimal adjustments, the copied test plan becomes well-suited for the new cycle. This practice streamlines the planning process and ensures consistency across iterations.
Cloning proves especially useful when you need to branch your application into two versions. After cloning, you can modify tests independently for each version without impacting the other. Itâs an efficient way to manage testing efforts while maintaining separation between different application variants.

Import or clone test suites
When you're creating the test plan for a new sprint, you often want to repeat some of the tests from the previous sprints, to make sure that the functionality you already implemented still works.

Note
When you import (Web) or clone (TCM) a test suite to a new project, the new suite contains copies of all test cases in the source suite. However, it doesn't retain any historical data like the previous test runs, related bugs, old results.
Shared steps referenced by the test cases are also cloned and created in the destination project.
You can't clone test cases from and to the same test plan, even into a different suite. To accomplish this scenario, you must first move the test cases to a different, temporary test plan. Then, use the temporary test plan as the source plan and clone the test cases back to the source test plan by putting the ID into the destination test plan place. Shared steps present in the test cases are also duplicated in this process.
When you're working with Azure Test Plans, you can import a test suite from one test plan into another test plan within the current project. It doesn't matter whether the test plans are within the same project. This process involves copying or cloning the test suite, resulting in the creation of a new test suite. Additionally, any subtest suites also get duplicated. The test cases referenced by the test suites don't duplicate; instead, they get referenced by the cloned test suites.
You can usetcm suites /listto list all test suites defined for a project.
tcm suites /list
To use the same test cases in different suites and plans, copy and paste test cases using theGridview.

Understand what gets cloned
When you clone a test suite, the following objects are copied from the source test plan to the destination test plan.
The following test information isn't copied:
Test settings: The test setting for the source test plan isn't copied. Instead, the test settings for the destination test plan are applied.
Test results and test runs: No test results are copied. Because test runs are applicable only to the source test plan, they aren't copied.
When/clonerequirementsis specified and Requirements-based test suites are copied:
/clonerequirements
The Requirements-based test suites get copied and linked to a new copy of the requirement work item.
Requirements work items (product backlog items or user stories) that are associated with a cloned requirements-based suite get cloned.
Bug work items get cloned in a project that uses the Scrum process template, or any project in which the Bug work item type is in the Requirements work item category. Otherwise, bugs aren't cloned.
When/clonerequirementsin't specified and Requirements-based test suites get copied:
/clonerequirements
Requirements-based test suites convert to static test suites in the destination test plan.
Cloned test cases are referenced under the static test suite.
Cloned test cases don't include links to their original requirements work items.
Example
The following example illustrates cloning test suite97defined for theFabrikam Fiberproject to theFabrikam Gitproject. Because the test suite contained a query-based suite, a warning message is listed to review and revise the respective query in the source and destination test suites.

Copy and paste test case (Grid view)
When you're managing test cases, copying and pasting serve as a valuable technique to reuse the same tests across various suites and plans. For instance, consider a scenario where you have a comprehensive test suite, and you want to create a more focused subset of tests within another suite. TheDefine>Gridview provides support for both editing test cases and copying them to different test suites. For more information, seeCreate test cases, Use the Grid view to edit test cases.
Tip
Don't copy test cases when you want to test withdifferent configurationsordifferent data.
From the Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, or Chrome browsers, you can copy test cases from theGridview for one test plan and test suite to another test plan and test suite.
From theTest Plans>Test planspage, choose the test suite containing one or more test cases you want to copy. Within theDefinetab, selectGrid View.

Import automated test cases (TCM)
To import automated test cases to a test suite, usetcm testcase /import. You must specify a .dll file for the test assembly that contains your tests.
tcm testcase /import
tcm testcase /import /collection:teamprojectcollectionurl /teamproject:project
             /storage:path
             [/maxpriority:priority]
             [/minpriority:priority]
             [/category:filter]
             [/syncsuite:id [/include]]
             [/login:username,[password]]
tcm testcase /import /collection:teamprojectcollectionurl /teamproject:project
             /storage:path
             [/maxpriority:priority]
             [/minpriority:priority]
