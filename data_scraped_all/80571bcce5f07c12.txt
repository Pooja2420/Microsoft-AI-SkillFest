In this article, you'll learn how to create and customize visuals from query results, using the UI like that found in Azure Data Explorer Dashboards. These visuals can be further manipulated, and can be pinned in adashboard. The addition or modification of these visuals doesn't require rerunning the query, which can be especially useful for heavy queries.
For a full list of available visuals, seeVisualization. For visuals that are only available in the web UI or dashboards, seeDashboard-specific visuals.
