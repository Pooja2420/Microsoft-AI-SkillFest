This article shows you how to create, manage, and delete projects. A project is used to store discovery, business case, assessment, and migration metadata collected from the environment you're assessing or migrating. Within a project, you can track discovered assets, create business cases, conduct assessments, and orchestrate migrations to Azure.
Classic Azure Migrate is retiring in Feb 2024. After Feb 2024, the classic version of Azure Migrate will no longer be supported and the inventory metadata in the classic project will be deleted. If you're using classic projects, delete those projects and follow the steps to create a new project. You can't upgrade classic projects or components to Azure Migrate. ViewFAQbefore you start the creation process.

Create a project in a specific region
In the portal, you can select the geography in which you want to create the project. If you want to create the project within a specific Azure region, use the following API command to create the  project.
PUT /subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Migrate/MigrateProjects/<mymigrateprojectname>?api-version=2018-09-01-preview "{location: 'centralus', properties: {}}"
PUT /subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Migrate/MigrateProjects/<mymigrateprojectname>?api-version=2018-09-01-preview "{location: 'centralus', properties: {}}"
After you have created the project, perform the following steps to try out the new agentless dependency analysis enhancements:
Ensure that you have installed Az CLI to execute the required commands by following the steps provided in the documentationhere.
After you install the Az CLI (in PowerShell), open PowerShell on your system as an Administrator and execute the following commands:
Log in to the Azure tenant and set the Subscription.az login --tenant <TENANT_ID>az account set --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
az login --tenant <TENANT_ID>
az account set --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
Register the Dependency Map private preview feature on the Subscription.az feature registration create --name PrivatePreview --namespace Microsoft.DependencyMap
az feature registration create --name PrivatePreview --namespace Microsoft.DependencyMap
Ensure that the feature is in registered state.â¯
az feature registration show --name PrivatePreview     --provider-namespace Microsoft.DependencyMap
- Output contains - "state": "Registered"
Register the new Dependency Map resource provider.â¯az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DependencyMap
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DependencyMap
Ensure that the provider is in registered state.az provider show -n Microsoft.DependencyMapOutput contains - "registrationState": "Registered"
az provider show -n Microsoft.DependencyMap
Output contains - "registrationState": "Registered"
