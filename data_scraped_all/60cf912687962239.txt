Select the version of this article that corresponds to your platform and version. The version selector is above the table of contents.Look up your Azure DevOps platform and version.
In this article, find basic syntax guidance for using Markdown in Azure DevOps features andwiki Markdown. You can use both commonMarkdown conventionsandGitHub-flavored extensions.
Use Markdown to add formatting, tables, images, and more to your project pages, README files, dashboards, pull requests,wikis, and so on.
Not all Markdown syntax is supported across all features in Azure DevOps. The following table links to each basic syntax section in this article and highlights which features support it.
For more information, seeDefinition of Done (board),Markdown widget,pull request,README files, andwiki.
Headers
Structure your content using headers. Headers segment longer content, making it easier to read.
To set a heading, start a line with a hash character#. Organize your remarks with subheadings by starting a line with more hash characters, for example,####. You can use up to six levels of headings.
#
####
Example:
# This is a H1 header
## This is a H2 header
### This is a H3 header
#### This is a H4 header
##### This is a H5 header
# This is a H1 header
## This is a H2 header
### This is a H3 header
#### This is a H4 header
##### This is a H5 header
Result:

Paragraphs and line breaks
Make your text easier to read by breaking it into paragraphs or line breaks.
Pull requests
In pull request comments, selectEnterto insert a line break, and begin text on a new line.
Example - pull request comment:
Add lines between your text with the **Enter** key.
Your text gets better spaced and makes it easier to read.
Result:
Add lines between your text with theEnterkey.
Your text gets better spaced and makes it easier to read.
Markdown files or widgets
In a Markdown file or widget, enter two spaces before the line break, and then selectEnterto begin a new paragraph.
Example - Markdown file or widget:
Add two spaces before the end of the line, and then select **Enter**.(space, space, Enter)
A space gets added in between paragraphs.
Result:
Add two spaces before the end of the line, and then select Enter.
A space gets added in between paragraphs.
Blockquotes
Quote previous comments or text to set the context for your comment or text. Quote single lines of text with>before the text. Use many>characters to nest quoted text. Quote blocks of lines of text by using the same level of>across many lines.
>
>
>
Example:
> Single line quote
>> Nested quote
>> multiple line
>> quote
Result:

Horizontal rules
To add a horizontal rule, add a line that's a series of dashes---. The line above the line containing the---must be blank.
---
---
Example:
above
Â 
----
below
Result:
above
below
Emphasis (bold, italics, strikethrough)
You can emphasize text by applying bold, italics, or strikethrough to characters:
To apply italics: surround the text with an asterisk*or underscore_
*
_
To apply bold: surround the text with double asterisks**.
**
To apply strikethrough: surround the text with double tilde characters~~.
~~
Combine these elements to apply emphasis to the text.
Note
There is no Markdown syntax that supports underlining text. Within a wiki page, you can use the HTML<u>tag to generate underlined text. For example,<u>underlined text</u>yieldsunderlined text.
<u>
<u>underlined text</u>
Example:
Use _emphasis_ in comments to express **strong** opinions and point out ~~corrections~~  
**_Bold, italicized text_**  
**~~Bold, strike-through text~~**
Result:
Useemphasisin comments to expressstrongopinions and point outcorrectionsBold, italicized textBold, strike-through text
Code highlighting
Highlight suggested code segments using code highlight blocks.
To indicate a span of code, wrap it with three backtick quotes (```) on a new line at both the start and end of the
block. To indicate code inline, wrap it with one backtick quote (`).
```
`
Code highlighting entered within the Markdown widget renders code as plain preformatted text.
Example:
```
sudo npm install vsoagent-installer -g  
```
Result:
sudo npm install vsoagent-installer -g
sudo npm install vsoagent-installer -g
Example:
```To install the Microsoft Cross Platform Build & Release Agent, run the following: `$ sudo npm install vsoagent-installer -g`.```
Result:
To install the Microsoft Cross Platform Build & Release Agent, run the following command: `$ sudo npm install vsoagent-installer -g`.
To install the Microsoft Cross Platform Build & Release Agent, run the following command: `$ sudo npm install vsoagent-installer -g`.
Within a Markdown file, text with four spaces at the beginning of the line automatically converts to a code block.
Set a language identifier for the code block to enable syntax highlighting for any of the supported languages inhighlightjs.
``` language
code
```
More examples:
``` js
const count = records.length;
```
const count = records.length;
const count = records.length;
``` csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
Suggest change
In pull requests, you can use comments to suggest replacement text for one or more lines in a file.
Users can easily apply the suggested change by selectingApply Change. This action results in committing the change to the pull request.
Code highlighting entered within the Markdown widget renders code in diff format with line prefixed by '-' and '+'.
Example:
```suggestion
  for i in range(A, B+100, C):
```

For more information, seeSuggest changes in comments.
Tables
Organize structured data with tables. Tables are especially useful for describing function parameters, object methods, and other data with a
clear name to description mapping.
Place each table row on its own line.
Separate table cells using the pipe character|.
|
To use a pipe character within a table, you must escape with a backslash\|.
\|
The first two lines of a table set the column headers and the alignment of elements in the table.
Use colons (:) when dividing the header and body of tables to specify column alignment (left, center, right).
:
To start a new line, use the HTML break tag (<br/>) (works within a Wiki but not elsewhere).
<br/>
Make sure to end each row with a carriage return (CR) or line feed (LF).
You must enter a blank space before and after work item or pull request (PR) mentioned inside a table cell.
Example:
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |  
|-----------|:-----------:|-----------:|  
| Cell A1 | Cell A2 | Cell A3 |  
| Cell B1 | Cell B2 | Cell B3<br/>second line of text |
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |  
|-----------|:-----------:|-----------:|  
| Cell A1 | Cell A2 | Cell A3 |  
| Cell B1 | Cell B2 | Cell B3<br/>second line of text |
Result:
Lists
Use lists to organize related items. You can add ordered lists with numbers or unordered lists with just bullets. Ordered lists start with a number followed by a period for each list item. Unordered lists start with a-.
-
Begin each list item on a new line. In a Markdown file or widget, enter two spaces before the line break to begin a new paragraph or enter two line breaks consecutively to begin a new paragraph.
Ordered or numbered lists
Example:
1. First item.
1. Second item.
1. Third item.
1. First item.
1. Second item.
1. Third item.
Result:
First item.
Second item.
Third item.
Bulleted lists
Example:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
Result:

Item 2
Item 3
Nested lists
Example:
1. First item.
   - Item 1
   - Item 2
   - Item 3
1. Second item.
   - Nested item 1
      - Further nested item 1

Links
In pull request comments and wikis, HTTP and HTTPS URLs automatically format as links. You can link to work items by entering the#key and a work item ID and then choosing the work item from the list.
#
Avoid auto suggestions for work items by prefixing#with a backslash (\). This action can be useful if you want to use#for color hex codes.
#
\
#
In Markdown files and widgets, you can set text hyperlinks for your URL using the standard Markdown link syntax:
[Link Text](Link URL)
[Link Text](Link URL)
When you link to another Markdown page in the same Git or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repository, the link target can be a relative path or an absolute path in the repository.
Supported links for Welcome pages:
Relative path:[text to display](target.md)
[text to display](target.md)
Absolute path in Git:[text to display](/folder/target.md)
[text to display](/folder/target.md)
Absolute path in TFVC:[text to display]($/project/folder/target.md)
[text to display]($/project/folder/target.md)
URL:[text to display](http://address.com)
[text to display](http://address.com)
Supported links for Markdown widget:
URL:[text to display](http://address.com)
[text to display](http://address.com)
Supported links for Wiki:
Absolute path of Wiki pages:[text to display](/parent-page/child-page)
[text to display](/parent-page/child-page)
URL:[text to display](http://address.com)
[text to display](http://address.com)
Note
Links to documents on file shares usingfile://aren't supported for security purposes.
file://
For information on how to specify relative links from a Welcome page or Markdown widget, seeSource control relative links.
Example:
[C# language reference](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/)
[C# language reference](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/)
Result:
C# language reference

Source control relative links
Links to source control files get interpreted differently depending on whether you specify them in a Welcome page or a Markdown widget. The system interprets relative links as follows:
Welcome page:Relative to the root of the source control repository in which the welcome page exists
Markdown widget:Relative to the team project collection URL base
For example:
Anchor links
Within Markdown files, anchor IDs get assigned to all headings when rendered as HTML. Anchor links also support special characters. The ID is the heading text, with the spaces replaced by dashes (-) and all lower case. The following conventions apply to anchor links:
Punctuation marks and leading white spaces within a file name are ignored
Upper case letters convert to lower case letters
Spaces between letters convert to dashes (-)
Example:
###Link to a heading in the page
###Link to a heading in the page
Result:
The syntax for an anchor link to a section...
[Link to a heading in the page](#link-to-a-heading-in-the-page)
You can also reference headings within another Markdown file:
[text to display](./target.md#heading-id)
[text to display](/page-name#section-name)

Images
To highlight issues or make things more interesting, you can add images and animated GIFs to the following aspects of your pull requests.
Comments
Markdown files
Wiki pages
Use the following syntax to add an image:
![Text](URL)

Example:
![Illustration to use for new users](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/cvt-779fa2985e70b1ef1c34d319b505f7b4417add09948df4c5b81db2a9bad966e5/images/page/services/devops/hero-images/index-hero.jpg)
Result:
The path to the image file can be a relative path or the absolute path in Git or TFVC, just like the path to another Markdown file in a link.
Relative path:![Image alt text](./image.png)
![Image alt text](./image.png)
Absolute path in Git:![Image alt text](/media/markdown-guidance/image.png)
![Image alt text](/media/markdown-guidance/image.png)
Absolute path in TFVC:![Image alt text]($/project/folder/media/markdown-guidance/image.png)
![Image alt text]($/project/folder/media/markdown-guidance/image.png)
Resize image:IMAGE_URL =WIDTHxHEIGHTNoteBe sure to include a space before the equal sign.Example:![Image alt text]($/project/folder/media/markdown-guidance/image.png =500x250)It's also possible to specify only the WIDTH by leaving out the HEIGHT value:IMAGE_URL =WIDTHx
IMAGE_URL =WIDTHxHEIGHT
Note
Be sure to include a space before the equal sign.
Example:![Image alt text]($/project/folder/media/markdown-guidance/image.png =500x250)
![Image alt text]($/project/folder/media/markdown-guidance/image.png =500x250)
It's also possible to specify only the WIDTH by leaving out the HEIGHT value:IMAGE_URL =WIDTHx
IMAGE_URL =WIDTHx
Checklist or task list
Lightweight task lists are great ways to track progress on your to-dos as a pull request creator or reviewer in the PR description or in a wiki page. Select the Markdown toolbar to get started or apply the format to the selected text.
Use[ ]or[x]to support checklists. Precede the checklist with either-<space>or1.<space>(any numeral).
[ ]
[x]
-<space>
1.<space>
Example - Apply the task list Markdown to a highlighted list

To mark items as completed by checking the boxes, you need to manually edit the markdown and modify the syntax after adding a task list.

Example - Format a list as a task list
- [ ] A  
- [ ] B  
- [ ] C  
- [x] A  
- [x] B  
- [x] C
Result:
Note
A checklist within a table cell isn't supported.
Emoji
In pull request comments and wiki pages, you can use emojis to add character and react to comments in the request. Enter what you're feeling surrounded by:characters to get a matching emoji in your text. We supportmostemojis.
:
Example:
:smile:
:angry:
Result:

To escape emojis, enclose them using the ` character.
Example:
`:smile:` `:)` `:angry:`

Attachments
In pull request comments and wiki pages, you can attach files to illustrate your point or to give more detailed reasoning behind your suggestions. To attach a file, drag and drop it into the comment field, or wiki page edit experience. You can also select thepaperclipin the upper right of the comment box or from the format pane in your wiki page.

If you have an image on your clipboard, you can paste it into the comment box or wiki page, and it renders directly into your comment or wiki page.
Attaching nonimage files creates a link to the file in your comment. To change the text displayed in the link, update the description text between the brackets.
The attached image files render directly into your comment or wiki pages. Save or update your comment or wiki page with an attachment. Then, you can see the attached image and select links to download the attached files.
Attachments support the following file formats:
Note
Not all file formats are supported within pull requests, such as Microsoft Office Message (.msg) files.

Use Markdown in wikis
The following guidance shows Markdown syntax for use in Azure DevOps wikis.
Add Mermaid diagrams to a wiki page
Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.
Note
Not all syntax in the following linked content for diagram types works in Azure DevOps. For example, we don't support most HTML tags, Font Awesome,flowchartsyntax (graphused instead), or LongArrow---->.
flowchart

---->
Mermaid isn't supported in the Internet Explorer browser.
If you experience an "Unsupported diagram type," the functionality may not be yet available in your organization due to usual deployment scheme.
Wiki supports the following Mermaid diagram types:
Sequence diagrams
Gantt charts
Flowcharts
Class diagram
State diagram
User Journey
Pie chart
Requirements diagram
For more information, see theMermaid release notesandactive requests in the Developer Community.
To add a Mermaid diagram to a wiki page, use the following syntax:

Create a table of contents (TOC) for wiki pages
To create a table of contents, add a [[_TOC_]]. The TOC is generated when the tag gets added and there's at least one heading on the page.

The [[_TOC_]] can be placed anywhere in the page to render the table of contents.
Only Markdown headings are considered for TOC (HTML heading tags aren't considered).
All HTML and Markdown tags get stripped from the headings while adding it inside the TOC block.
See the following example of how the TOC renders when you add bold and italics to a heading.

Consistency is maintained in the formatting of the TOC.
Note
The tag [[_TOC_]] is case-sensitive. For example, [[_toc_]] may not render the TOC. Also, only the first instance of [[_TOC_]] is rendered and the rest are ignored.
Add a subpages table
Add a table of content for subpages (TOSP) to your wiki pages. This table has links to all subpages located under the page where the table of subpages is shown.
You can add the table of subpages either by inserting the special tag[[_TOSP_]]manually or by selecting from theMore optionsmenu. Only the first[[_TOSP_]]tag is used to create the table of subpages.
[[_TOSP_]]
[[_TOSP_]]

Add a collapsible section
To add a collapsible section in a wiki page, use the following syntax:
# A collapsible section with markdown
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

  ## Heading
  1. A numbered
  2. list
     * With some
     * Sub bullets

View page visits for wiki pages
Automatically, you see an aggregated count of page visits for the last 30 days on every page. We define a page visit as a page view by a given user in a 15-minute interval.
Use the batch APIpagesBatchto see the daily quantity of visits to all pages in a paginated way. They aren't sorted by number of visits, however. For data over 30 days old, you can get all page visits using the rest API. Sort these pages based on the number of visits to get the top 100. You can store these visits in a dashboard or database.
