Problem
Cluster creation fails with a message about a cloud provider error when you hover over cluster state.
Cloud Provider Launch Failure: A cloud provider error was encountered while setting up the cluster.
When youview the cluster event logto get more details, you see a message aboutpublicIPAddresseslimits.
ResourceQuotaExceeded Azure error message: Creating the resource of type 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses' would exceed the quota of '800' resources of type 'Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses' per resource group. The current resource count is '800', please delete some resources of this type before creating a new one.'
You may also see an error about core address limits.
Operation results in exceeding quota limits of Core. Maximum allowed: 350, Current in use: 350, Additional requested: 4.
Cause
Azure subscriptions have a public IP address limit which restricts the number of public IP addresses you can use. This is a hard limit. If you try to start a cluster that would result in your account exceeding the public IP address quota the cluster launch will fail.
Solution
You can either free up resources or request a quota increase for your account.
Stop inactive clusters to free up public IP addresses for use.
Open an Azure support case with a request to increase the quota limit for your subscription.
For more information, please review the following documentation:
