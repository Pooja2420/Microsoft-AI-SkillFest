Applies to:SQL Server on Azure VM
This guide teaches you to migrate your user databases from IBM Db2 to SQL Server on Azure VM, by using the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Db2.
For other migration guides, seeAzure Database Migration Guides.
Prerequisites
To migrate your Db2 database to SQL Server, you need:
To verify that yoursource environment is supported.
SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2.
Connectivitybetween your source environment and your SQL Server VM in Azure.
A targetSQL Server on Azure VM.
Pre-migration
After you have met the prerequisites, you're ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of your migration.
Assess
Use SSMA for DB2 to review database objects and data, and assess databases for migration.
To create an assessment, follow these steps:
OpenSSMA for Db2.

SelectFile>New Project.
SelectFile>New Project.
Provide a project name and a location to save your project. Then select a SQL Server migration target from the drop-down list, and selectOK.

OnConnect to Db2, enter values for the Db2 connection details.

Right-click the Db2 schema you want to migrate, and then chooseCreate report. This will generate an HTML report. Alternatively, you can chooseCreate reportfrom the navigation bar after selecting the schema.

Review the HTML report to understand conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Db2 objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder withinSSMAProjects.For example:drive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyDb2Migration\report\report_<date>.

Validate data types
Validate the default data type mappings, and change them based on requirements if necessary. To do so, follow these steps:
SelectToolsfrom the menu.
SelectToolsfrom the menu.
SelectProject Settings.
SelectProject Settings.
Select theType mappingstab.
Select theType mappingstab.

You can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in theDb2 Metadata Explorer.

Convert schema
To convert the schema, follow these steps:
(Optional) Add dynamic or ad hoc queries to statements. Right-click the node, and then chooseAdd statements.

Save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. From theFilemenu, selectSave Project. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline, and perform remediation before you can publish the schema to SQL Server on Azure VM.

Migrate
After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process.
To publish your schema and migrate your data, follow these steps:
Publish the schema. InSQL Server Metadata Explorer, from theDatabasesnode, right-click the database. Then selectSynchronize with Database.

Migrate the data. Right-click the database or object you want to migrate inDb2 Metadata Explorer, and chooseMigrate data. Alternatively, you can selectMigrate Datafrom the navigation bar. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expandTables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box.

Post-migration
After the migration is complete, you need to go through a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
Remediate applications
After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this will in some cases require changes to the applications.
Perform tests
Testing consists of the following activities:
Develop validation tests: To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you have defined.
Set up the test environment: The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.
Run validation tests: Run the validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.
Run performance tests: Run performance tests against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.
Migration assets
For additional assistance, see the following resources, which were developed in support of a real-world migration project engagement:
The Data SQL Engineering team developed these resources. This team's core charter is to unblock and accelerate complex modernization for data platform migration projects to Microsoft's Azure data platform.
Next steps
After migration, review thePost-migration validation and optimization guide.
For Microsoft and third-party services and tools that are available to assist you with various database and data migration scenarios, seeData migration services and tools.
