Azure Machine Learning data exfiltration prevention

Azure Machine Learning has several inbound and outbound dependencies. Some of these dependencies can expose a data exfiltration risk by malicious agents within your organization. This document explains how to minimize data exfiltration risk by limiting inbound and outbound requirements.
Inbound: If your compute instance or cluster uses a public IP address, you have an inbound onazuremachinelearning(port 44224) service tag. You can control this inbound traffic by using a network security group (NSG) and service tags. It's difficult to disguise Azure service IPs, so there's low data exfiltration risk. You can also configure the compute to not use a public IP, which removes inbound requirements.

Outbound: If malicious agents don't have write access to outbound destination resources, they can't use that outbound for data exfiltration. Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Resource Manager, Azure Machine Learning, and Microsoft Container Registry belong to this category. On the other hand, Storage and AzureFrontDoor.frontend can be used for data exfiltration.Storage Outbound: This requirement comes from compute instance and compute cluster. A malicious agent can use this outbound rule to exfiltrate data by provisioning and saving data in their own storage account. You can remove data exfiltration risk by using an Azure Service Endpoint Policy and Azure Batch's simplified node communication architecture.AzureFrontDoor.frontend outbound: Azure Front Door is used by the Azure Machine Learning studio UI and AutoML. Instead of allowing outbound to the service tag (AzureFrontDoor.frontend), switch to the following fully qualified domain names (FQDN). Switching to these FQDNs removes unnecessary outbound traffic included in the service tag and allows only what is needed for Azure Machine Learning studio UI and AutoML.ml.azure.comautomlresources-prod-d0eaehh7g8andvav.b02.azurefd.net

Tip
The information in this article is primarily about using an Azure Virtual Network. Azure Machine Learning can also use amanaged virtual networks. With a managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning handles the job of network isolation for your workspace and managed computes.
To address data exfiltration concerns, managed virtual networks allow you to restrict egress to only approved outbound traffic. For more information, seeWorkspace managed network isolation.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription
An Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
An Azure Machine Learning workspace with a private endpoint that connects to the VNet.The storage account used by the workspace must also connect to the VNet using a private endpoint.
The storage account used by the workspace must also connect to the VNet using a private endpoint.
You need to recreate compute instance or scale down compute cluster to zero node.Not required if you have joined preview.Not required if you have new compute instance and compute cluster created after December 2022.

Not required if you have new compute instance and compute cluster created after December 2022.
Why do I need to use the service endpoint policy
Service endpoint policies allow you to filter egress virtual network traffic to Azure Storage accounts over service endpoint and allow data exfiltration to only specific Azure Storage accounts. Azure Machine Learning compute instance and compute cluster requires access to Microsoft-managed storage accounts for its provisioning. The Azure Machine Learning alias in service endpoint policies includes Microsoft-managed storage accounts. We use service endpoint policies with the Azure Machine Learning alias to prevent data exfiltration or control the destination storage accounts. You can learn more inService Endpoint policy documentation.
1. Create the service endpoint policy
From theAzure portal, add a newService Endpoint Policy. On theBasicstab, provide the required information and then selectNext.

Important
If your compute instance and compute cluster need access to additional storage accounts, your service endpoint policy should include the additional storage accounts in the resources section. Note that it is not required if you use Storage private endpoints. Service endpoint policy and private endpoint are independent.
2. Allow inbound and outbound network traffic
Inbound

Important
The following information isin additionto the guidance provided in theSecure training environment with virtual networksandConfigure inbound and outbound network trafficarticles.
Select the configuration that you're using:
Service tag/NSG
Firewall
Allowoutbound traffic to the followingservice tags. Replace<region>with the Azure region that contains your compute cluster or instance:
<region>
BatchNodeManagement.<region>
AzureMachineLearning
Storage.<region>
Note
For the storage outbound, a Service Endpoint Policy will be applied in a later step to limit outbound traffic.
Allowoutbound traffic overANY port 443to the following FQDNs. Replace instances of<region>with the Azure region that contains your compute cluster or instance:
<region>
*.<region>.batch.azure.com
*.<region>.batch.azure.com
*.<region>.service.batch.azure.com
*.<region>.service.batch.azure.com
Warning
If you enable the service endpoint on the subnet used by your firewall, you must open outbound traffic to the following hosts overTCP port 443:
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.blob.core.windows.net
*.queue.core.windows.net
*.queue.core.windows.net
*.table.core.windows.net
*.table.core.windows.net

3. Enable storage endpoint for the subnet
Use the following steps to enable a storage endpoint for the subnet that contains your Azure Machine Learning compute clusters and compute instances:
From theAzure portal, select theAzure Virtual Networkfor your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
From the left of the page, selectSubnetsand then select the subnet that contains your compute cluster and compute instance.
In the form that appears, expand theServicesdropdown and then enableMicrosoft.Storage. SelectSaveto save these changes.
Apply the service endpoint policy to your workspace subnet.

4. Curated environments
When using Azure Machine Learning curated environments, make sure to use the latest environment version. The container registry for the environment must also bemcr.microsoft.com. To check the container registry, use the following steps:
mcr.microsoft.com
FromAzure Machine Learning studio, select your workspace and then selectEnvironments.
FromAzure Machine Learning studio, select your workspace and then selectEnvironments.
Verify that theAzure Container Registrybegins with a value ofmcr.microsoft.com.ImportantIf the container registry isviennaglobal.azurecr.ioyou cannot use the curated environment with the data exfiltration. Try upgrading to the latest version of the curated environment.
