We'll show you how to find a partner and what to expect from your partner.

Option 1- use Azure Migrate and Modernize.
Option 2- find a partner offer for a landing zone in our marketplace.

Option 1 - Azure Migrate and Modernize
The easiest option to find an ALZ partner is through Azure Migrate and Modernize.

Option 2 - Partner offers
We have a self-discovery process that you can use to find a partner. TheFind an Azure partnerpage provides information about working with certified Azure partners and links to the offers.
Offers come from Azure advanced specialization partners and Azure Expert Managed Services Providers (MSPs). Microsoft vets and approves each offer before it enters Azure Marketplace.
Advanced specialization partners demonstrate deep technical knowledge, proven success, and ethical business practices. Azure Expert MSPs also meet these criteria but must additionally pass a time- and cost-intensive auditing process.
Offers in the marketplace have a price, description, and contact information. Like any marketplace, there's flexibility in what the offer can be. Partners design and propose offers. Microsoft approves them for the marketplace.
This flexibility creates value for you and allows you to find an offer that meets your specific needs.

What to expect from partner offers
Partner offers are vetted and approved for the marketplace. They follow CAF principles in general but have more freedom to customize their approach to the ALZ process. Expectations should align with the offer description and any other agreements made between you and your chosen partner.
