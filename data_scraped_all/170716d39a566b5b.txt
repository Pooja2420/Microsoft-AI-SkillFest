Container insights automatically starts monitoring PV usage by collecting the following metrics at 60-second intervals and storing them in theInsightsMetricstable.
pvUsedBytes
podUID
podName
pvcName
pvcNamespace
capacityBytes
clusterId
clusterName

Monitor persistent volumes
Container insights includes preconfigured charts for this usage metric and inventory information in workbook templates for every cluster. You can also enable a recommended alert for PV usage and query these metrics in Log Analytics.
Workload Details workbook
You can find usage charts for specific workloads on thePersistent Volumestab of theWorkload Detailsworkbook directly from an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. SelectWorkbookson the left pane, from theView Workbooksdropdown list in the Insights pane, or from theReports (preview) tabin the Insights pane.

Persistent Volume Details workbook
You can find an overview of persistent volume inventory in thePersistent Volume Detailsworkbook directly from an AKS cluster by selectingWorkbooksfrom the left pane. You can also open this workbook from theView Workbooksdropdown list in the Insights pane or from theReportstab in the Insights pane.

Persistent Volume Usage recommended alert
You can enable a recommended alert to alert you when average PV usage for a pod is above 80%. To learn more about alerting, seeMetric alert rules in Container insights (preview). To learn how to override the default threshold, see theConfigure alertable metrics in ConfigMapssection.
Limitations
Persistent volumes where storage class is "azureblob-*" won't collect PV metrics due to a limitation in CAdvisor. The following command will show persistent volumes and their properties (including storage class).
kubectl get pvc
kubectl get pvc
