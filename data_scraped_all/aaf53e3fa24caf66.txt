Blob soft delete protects an individual blob and its versions, snapshots, and metadata from accidental deletes or overwrites by maintaining the deleted data in the system for a specified period of time. During the retention period, you can restore the blob to its state at deletion. After the retention period has expired, the blob is permanently deleted. For more information about blob soft delete, seeSoft delete for blobs.
Blob soft delete is part of a comprehensive data protection strategy for blob data. To learn more about Microsoft's recommendations for data protection, seeData protection overview.
Enable blob soft delete
You can enable or disable soft delete for a storage account at any time by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
Template
Blob soft delete is enabled by default when you create a new storage account with the Azure portal. The setting to enable or disable blob soft delete when you create a new storage account is on theData protectiontab. For more information about creating a storage account, seeCreate a storage account.
To enable blob soft delete for an existing storage account by using the Azure portal, follow these steps:
In theAzure portal, navigate to your storage account.
Locate theData Protectionoption underData management.
In theRecoverysection, selectTurn on soft delete for blobs.
Specify a retention period between 1 and 365 days. Microsoft recommends a minimum retention period of seven days.
Save your changes.

Blob soft delete is not enabled when you create a new storage account with PowerShell. You can enable blob soft delete after the new account has been created.
To enable blob soft delete for an existing storage account with PowerShell, call theEnable-AzStorageBlobDeleteRetentionPolicycommand, specifying the retention period in days.
The following example enables blob soft delete and sets the retention period to seven days. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values:
Enable-AzStorageBlobDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account> `
    -RetentionDays 7
Enable-AzStorageBlobDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account> `
    -RetentionDays 7
To check the current settings for blob soft delete, call theGet-AzStorageBlobServicePropertycommand:
$properties = Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account>
$properties.DeleteRetentionPolicy.Enabled
$properties.DeleteRetentionPolicy.Days
$properties = Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account>
$properties.DeleteRetentionPolicy.Enabled
$properties.DeleteRetentionPolicy.Days
Blob soft delete is not enabled when you create a new storage account with Azure CLI. You can enable blob soft delete after the new account has been created.
To enable blob soft delete for an existing storage account with Azure CLI, call theaz storage account blob-service-properties updatecommand, specifying the retention period in days.
The following example enables blob soft delete and sets the retention period to seven days. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values:
az storage account blob-service-properties update --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --enable-delete-retention true \
    --delete-retention-days 7
az storage account blob-service-properties update --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --enable-delete-retention true \
    --delete-retention-days 7
To check the current settings for blob soft delete, call theaz storage account blob-service-properties showcommand:
az storage account blob-service-properties show --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
az storage account blob-service-properties show --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
To enable blob soft delete with an Azure Resource Manager template, create a template that sets thedeleteRetentionPolicyproperty. The following steps describe how to create a template in the Azure portal.
