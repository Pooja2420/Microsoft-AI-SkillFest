Extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation on Azure virtual machines (VMs). The Azure platform hosts many extensions covering VM configuration, monitoring, security, and utility applications. Publishers take an application, wrap it into an extension, and simplify the installation. All you need to do is provide mandatory parameters.
View available extensions
You can view available extensions for a VM in the Azure portal.
In the portal, go to theOverviewpage for a VM.
UnderSettings, selectExtensions + Applications.
The list of available extensions are displayed.Â To see the complete list of extensions, seeDiscovering VM Extensions for LinuxandDiscovering VM Extensions for Windows.
Install and use extensions
Azure VM extensions can be managed by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, and the Azure portal.
From theExtensions + Applicationsfor the VM, on theExtensionstab, select+ Add.
Locate theCustom Script Extensionoption. Select the extension option, then selectNext.
You can then pass in a command or script to run the extension.
For more information, seeLinux Custom Script ExtensionandWindows Custom Script Extension.
Check for prerequisites
Some individual VM extension applications might have their own environmental prerequisites, such as access to an endpoint. Each extension has an article that explains any prerequisites, including which operating systems are supported.
Manage extension application lifecycle
You don't need to connect to a VM directly to install or delete an extension. The Azure extension lifecycle is managed outside of the VM and integrated into the Azure platform.
Automatic extension upgradecan be used to monitor for new minor versions and automatically upgrade extensions in a safe rolling manner.
Troubleshoot extensions
If you're looking for general troubleshooting steps for Windows VM extensions, refer toTroubleshooting Azure Windows VM extension failures.
Otherwise, specific troubleshooting information for each extension can be found in theTroubleshoot and supportsection in the overview for the extension. Here's a list of the troubleshooting information available:
