You can use Azure Update Manager to create and save recurring deployment schedules. You can create a schedule on a daily, weekly, or hourly cadence. You can specify the machines that must be updated as part of the schedule and the updates to be installed.
This schedule then automatically installs the updates according to the created schedule for a single VM and at scale.
Update Manager uses a maintenance control schedule instead of creating its own schedules. Maintenance control enables customers to manage platform updates. For more information, seeMaintenance control documentation.
Prerequisites for scheduled patching

If you set the patch mode toAzure orchestrated(AutomaticByPlatform) but do not enable theBypassPlatformSafetyChecksOnUserScheduleflag and do not attach a maintenance configuration to an Azure machine, it's treated as anautomatic guest patching-enabled machine.

AutomaticByPlatform
Scheduled patching in an availability set
All VMs in a commonavailability setaren't updated concurrently.
VMs in a common availability set are updated within Update Domain boundaries. VMs across multiple Update Domains aren't updated concurrently.
In scenarios where machines from the same availability set are being patched at the same time in different schedules, it is likely that they might not get patched or could potentially fail if the maintenance window exceeds. To avoid this, we recommend that you either increase the maintenance window or split the machines belonging to the same availability set across multiple schedules at different times.
Configure reboot settings
The registry keys listed inConfigure Automatic Updates by editing the registryandRegistry keys used to manage restartcan cause your machines to reboot. A reboot can occur even if you specifyNever Rebootin theSchedulesettings. Configure these registry keys to best suit your environment.
Service limits
We recommend the following limits for the indicators.
For more information, see theservice limits for Dynamic scope.

For example, if you want to patch on the first Saturday after a patch on Tuesday, set the recurrence as the second Tuesday of the month with a +4 day offset. Optionally, you can also specify an end date when you want the schedule to expire.

Onboard to schedule by using Azure Policy
Update Manager allows you to target a group of Azure or non-Azure VMs for update deployment via Azure Policy. The grouping using a policy keeps you from having to edit your deployment to update machines. You can use subscription, resource group, tags, or regions to define the scope. You can use this feature for the built-in policies, which you can customize according to your use case.
Note
This policy also ensures that the patch orchestration property for Azure machines is set toCustomer Managed Schedulesbecause it's a prerequisite for scheduled patching.
Assign a policy
Azure Policy allows you to assign standards and assess compliance at scale. For more information, seeOverview of Azure Policy. To assign a policy to scope:

Check your scheduled patching run
You can check the deployment status and history of your maintenance configuration runs from the Update Manager portal. For more information, seeUpdate deployment history by maintenance run ID.
Timeline of Maintenance Window
The maintenance window controls the number of updates that can be installed on your virtual machine and Arc-enabled servers. We recommend that you go through the following table to understand the timeline for a maintenance window while installing an update:
For example, if a maintenance window is of 3 hours and starts at 3:00 PM, the following are the details on how the updates are installed:
Windows
Linux
Note
Azure Update Manager doesn't stop installing the new updates if it's approaching the end of the maintenance window.
Azure Update Manger doesn't terminate in-progress updates if the maintenance window is exceeded and only the remaining updates that must be installed aren't attempted. We recommend that you re-evaluate the duration of your maintenance window to ensure all the updates are installed .
If the maintenance window is exceeded on Windows, it's often because a service pack update is taking a long time to install.
