Mosaic AI Vector Search is Public Preview
November 30, 2023
Mosaic AI Vector Search is a serverless similarity search engine that allows you to store a vector representation of your data, including metadata, in a vector index. As part of this functionality, you can create auto-updating vector search indexes from data in Unity Catalog and query them with a simple API to return the most similar vectors as part of your RAG workflows. SeeMosaic AI Vector Search.
Access controls lists can no longer be disabled
November 29, 2023
The following settings are enabled on all Premium plan workspaces and can no longer be disabled from the workspace admin settings page or the Workspace Conf API:
Workspace access control: enables users to configure permissions to workspace objects.
Cluster, pool, jobs access control: enables users to configure permissions to clusters, pools, and jobs.
Cluster visibility control: prevents clusters from being visible to users that have no permissions on them.
Jobs visibility control: prevents jobs being from visible to users that have no permissions on them.
Workspace visibility control setting: prevents notebooks and folders from being from visible to users that have no permissions on them.
Access control settings have been enabled on new workspaces by default sinceMarch 2018and visibility control settings have been enabled by default sinceDecember 2020.
For more information, seeAccess control lists.
