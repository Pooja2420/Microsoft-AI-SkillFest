Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
Thecloud offering, Azure DevOps Services, provides a scalable, reliable, and globally available hosted service. The 24/7 operations team monitors the cloud offering, which is backed by a 99.9% service level agreement (SLA) and available in local data centers around the world.
Theon-premises offering, Azure DevOps Server, is built on a SQL Server backend. Customers usually choose the on-premises version when they need their data to stay within their network. This offering is also ideal when you need access to SQL Server reporting services that integrate with Azure DevOps Server data and tools.
Both offerings provide the sameessential features and services, but Azure DevOps Services offers more benefits:
Simplifies server management
Provides immediate access to the latest features
Enhances connectivity with remote sites
Transitions from capital expenditures (servers and hardware) to operational expenditures (subscriptions)
Key differences
Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server offer similar core functionalities, but they have key differences in specific feature areas. To decide whether the cloud or on-premises offering best meets your needs, consider the following key differences.
These differences can help you decide which platform best suits your organization's needs. If you use Azure DevOps Server and you're considering a move to Azure DevOps Services, see theMigration overview.
Scalability
As your business grows, you might need to scale up your Azure DevOps instance. This scaling can involve adding more users, increasing storage capacity, or enhancing performance to handle larger workloads. You might also need to integrate other tools and services to support more complex workflows and ensure seamless collaboration across larger teams. Azure DevOps provides various options and configurations to help you scale efficiently, whether you're using Azure DevOps Services in the cloud or Azure DevOps Server on-premises.
Azure DevOps Services
Azure DevOps Services offers two options for scoping and scaling data: organizations and projects. Organizations in Azure DevOps Services get their own URLs (for example,https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber), and they always have exactly one project collection. Organizations can have many projects within a collection.
https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber
Create organizations in Azure DevOps Services wherever you might create collections in Azure DevOps Server. Consider the following scenarios:
Purchase users per organization. Paid users can access only the organization where the payment is made. For users needing access to multiple organizations, Visual Studio subscriptions are an attractive option. Visual Studio subscribers can be added to any number of organizations at no charge.
Administer organizations individually. Currently, you must administer organizations one at a time, which can be cumbersome if you have many organizations.
For more information, seePlan your organizational structure in Azure DevOps.
Azure DevOps Server
Azure DevOps Server provides three options for scoping and scaling data: deployments, project collections, and projects.
Deployments: In the simplest case, deployments are servers. They can be more complex, such as two-server deployments where SQL is on a separate machine or high-availability farms with multiple servers.

Authentication
When you compare Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server, it's important to understand the differences in how authentication is handled for each platform.
Azure DevOps Services
With Azure DevOps Services, you connect over the public internet (for example,https://contoso.visualstudio.com). You can authenticate by using eitherMicrosoft accountcredentials orMicrosoft Entra IDcredentials, depending on your organization setup. Microsoft Entra ID also allows you to enable features such as multifactor authentication, IP address restrictions, and more.
https://contoso.visualstudio.com
The recommended approach is to configure your organizations to use Microsoft Entra rather than Microsoft accounts. This method provides a better experience in many scenarios and offers more options for enhanced security.
For more information, seeAbout accessing Azure DevOps Services with Microsoft Entra ID.
Azure DevOps Server
With Azure DevOps Server, you connect to an intranet server (for example,https://tfs.corp.contoso.com:8080/tfs). Authenticate by using Windows Authentication and your Windows AD domain credentials. This process is seamless, and you never encounter a sign-in experience.
https://tfs.corp.contoso.com:8080/tfs
Data control
Many entities seek information about data protection when considering a move to the cloud. Microsoft is committed to keeping Azure DevOps Services projects safe and secure. Technical features and business processes are established to uphold this commitment. You can also take steps to secure your data. For more information, see theData protection overview.
User management
When you manage users and groups in Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server, there are distinct methods and tools available for each platform to ensure proper access and organization.
Azure DevOps Services
In Azure DevOps Services, you canprovide access to groups of usersby adding Microsoft Entra groups to Azure DevOps Services groups. If you use Microsoft Accounts instead of Microsoft Entra ID, you mustadd usersindividually.
You must alsoassign an access levelto each user in your organization. Azure DevOps Services validates Visual Studio subscribers as they sign in. You can assign Basic access for free to up to five users without Visual Studio subscriptions.
To give at least Basic access to more users,set up billingandpay for more users. Otherwise, all other users receive Stakeholder access.
Microsoft Entra groups provide access to groups of users, with access levels automatically assigned at first sign-in. For organizations that use Microsoft accounts for signing in, you must explicitly assign access levels to each user.
Azure DevOps Server
In Azure DevOps Server, you grant users access to deployments by adding Windows AD groups to various Azure DevOps groups, such as the Contributors group for an individual project. Windows AD group memberships stay in sync. As users are added or removed in Windows AD, they automatically gain or lose access to Azure DevOps Server.
All use is on the honor system. To set access levels for users based on their licenses, specify theiraccess levelson the administration page. For example, assign unlicensed users Stakeholder access only.
Users with an Azure DevOps Server Client Access License (CAL) can have Basic access. Visual Studio subscribers can have either Basic or Advanced access, depending on their subscription. Azure DevOps Server doesn't verify these licenses or enforce compliance.
In both Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server, you manage access to features by assigning users to anaccess level. All users must be assigned to a single access level. In both the cloud and on-premises offerings, you can give free access to work item features to an unlimited number of Stakeholders. Also, an unlimited number of Visual Studio subscribers can have access to all Basic features at no extra charge. You pay only for other users who need access.
Process customization
You can customize the work-tracking experience in different ways depending on the supported process model.
Azure DevOps Services
Azure DevOps Services uses theInheritanceprocess model, which supports WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) customization. This model allows you to easily customize work item types, states, and fields directly through the user interface without needing to edit XML files. You can create and modify processes to fit your team's workflow, and ensure the tools align with your specific project requirements. This flexibility makes it easier to manage and adapt to changes in your development process.
Azure DevOps Server
With Azure DevOps Server, you can choose between theInheritanceprocess model and theOn-premises XMLprocess model.
TheInheritance process modelsupports WYSIWYG customization, which allows you to easily customize work item types, states, and fields directly through the user interface. This approach simplifies the customization process and ensures that changes are immediately reflected in your projects.
TheOn-premises XML process modelsupports customization through the import or export of XML definition files for work-tracking objects. It provides a powerful and flexible way to define and manage your processes. However, it can cause various issues, such as:
Processes for existing projects aren't automatically updated, requiring manual intervention to apply changes.
The complexity of managing XML files can lead to errors and inconsistencies.
It might be challenging to maintain and troubleshoot customizations, especially in large or complex environments.
To help you avoid issues, custom process templates and thewitadmin.exetool are always disabled. This approach ensures that all projects are automatically updated with each Azure DevOps Services upgrade.
With the process customization capability, you can make changes directly within the web user interface (UI). If you prefer to customize your processes programmatically, you can use REST endpoints. Customizing projects this way ensures they're automatically updated when new versions of their base processes are released with Azure DevOps Services upgrades.
