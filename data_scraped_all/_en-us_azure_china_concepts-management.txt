Work with administrator roles
One account administrator role is created per Azure account, typically the person who signed up for or bought the Azure subscription. This role is authorized to use theAccount Centerto perform management tasks.
To sign in, the account administrator uses the organization ID (Org ID) created when the subscription was purchased.
Create a service administrator to manage the service deployment
One service administrator role is created per Azure account, and is authorized to manage services in the Azure portal. With a new subscription, the account administrator is also the service administrator.
Create a co-administrator
Account administrators can create up to 199 co-administrator roles per subscription. This role has the same access privileges as the service administrator, but can't change the association of subscriptions to Azure directories.
