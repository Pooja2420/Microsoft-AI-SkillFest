Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a powerful tool for exploring your data and discovering patterns, identifying anomalies and outliers, creating statistical modeling, and more.
KQL is a simple yet powerful language to query structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. The language is expressive, easy to read and understand the query intent, and optimized for authoring experiences. KQL is optimal for querying telemetry, metrics, and logs with deep support for text search and parsing, time-series operators and functions, analytics and aggregation, geospatial, vector similarity searches, and many other language constructs that provide the most optimal language for data analysis. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQLs: databases, tables, and columns.
If you have a background in scripting or working with databases, much the content of this article should feel familiar. If not, don't worry, as the intuitive nature of the language quickly enables you to start writing your own queries and driving value for your organization.
This article provides an explanation of the query language and offers practical exercises to get you started writing queries. To access the query environment, use theAzure Data Explorer web UI. To learn how to use KQL, seeTutorial: Learn common operators.

KQL is also the language you use to work with and manipulate data in Microsoft Sentinel. The logs you feed into your workspace aren't worth much if you can't analyze them and get the important information hidden in all that data. KQL has not only the power and flexibility to get that information, but the simplicity to help you get started quickly.
This article introduces the basics of KQL, covering some of the most used functions and operators, which should address 75 to 80 percent of the queries users write day to day. When you need more depth, or to run more advanced queries, you can take advantage of theAdvanced KQL for Microsoft Sentinel workbook.
Why KQL for Microsoft Sentinel?
Microsoft Sentinel is built on top of the Azure Monitor service and it uses Azure MonitorâsLog Analyticsworkspaces to store all of its data. This data includes any of the following:
data ingested from external sources into predefined tables using Microsoft Sentinel data connectors.
data ingested from external sources into user-defined custom tables, using custom-created data connectors and some types of out-of-the-box connectors.
data created by Microsoft Sentinel itself, resulting from the analyses it creates and performs - for example, alerts, incidents, and UEBA-related information.
data uploaded to Microsoft Sentinel to assist with detection and analysis - for example, threat intelligence feeds and watchlists.
KQL was developed as part of theAzure Data Explorerservice, and itâs therefore optimized for searching through big-data stores in a cloud environment. Itâs designed to help you dive deep into your data and explore their hidden treasures.
KQL is also used in Azure Monitor, and supports extra Azure Monitor features that allow you to retrieve, visualize, analyze, and parse data in Log Analytics data stores. In Microsoft Sentinel, you're using tools based on KQL whenever youâre visualizing and analyzing data and hunting for threats, whether in existing rules and workbooks, or in building your own.
Because KQL is a part of nearly everything you do in Microsoft Sentinel, a clear understanding of how it works helps you get that more out of your SIEM.
What is a Kusto query?
A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. The request is stated in plain text, using a data-flow model that is easy to read, author, and automate. Kusto queries are made of one or more query statements.
A Kusto query doesnât write any data. Queries operate on data that's organized into a hierarchy ofdatabases,tables, andcolumns, similar to SQL.
What is a query statement?
There are three kinds of userquery statements:
Atabular expression statement
Alet statement
Aset statement
All query statements are separated by a;(semicolon), and only affect the query at hand.
;
Note
For information about application query statements, seeApplication query statements.
The most common kind of query statement is a tabular expressionstatement, which means both its input and output consist of tables or tabular datasets. Tabular statements contain zero or moreoperators, each of which starts with a tabular input and returns a tabular output. Operators are sequenced by a|(pipe). Data flows, or is piped, from one operator to the next. The data is filtered or manipulated at each step and then fed into the following step.
|
It's like a funnel, where you start out with an entire data table. Each time the data passes through another operator, it's filtered, rearranged, or summarized. Because the piping of information from one operator to another is sequential, the query operator order is important, and can affect both results and performance. At the end of the funnel, you're left with a refined output.
Let's look at an example query.
Run the query
StormEvents
| where StartTime between (datetime(2007-11-01) .. datetime(2007-12-01))
| where State == "FLORIDA"
| count
StormEvents
| where StartTime between (datetime(2007-11-01) .. datetime(2007-12-01))
| where State == "FLORIDA"
| count
Note
KQL is case-sensitive for everything â table names, table column names, operators, functions, and so on.
Keywords can be used as identifiers by enclosing them in brackets and quotes (['and']or["and"]). For example,['where']. For more information, seeIdentifier naming rules
['
']
["
"]
['where']
This query has a single tabular expression statement. The statement begins with a reference to a table calledStormEventsand contains several operators,whereandcount, each separated by a pipe. The data rows for the source table are filtered by the value of theStartTimecolumn and then filtered by the value of theStatecolumn. In the last line, the query returns a table with a single column and a single row containing the count of the remaining rows.
where
count

Management commands
In contrast to Kusto queries,Management commandsare requests to Kusto to process or modify data or metadata. For example, the following management command creates a new Kusto table with two columns,LevelandText:
Level
Text
.create table Logs (Level:string, Text:string)
.create table Logs (Level:string, Text:string)
Management commands have their own syntax, which isn't part of the KQL syntax, although the two share many concepts. In particular, management commands are distinguished from queries by having the first character in the text of the command be the dot (.) character (which can't start a query).
This distinction prevents many kinds of security attacks, simply because it prevents embedding management commands inside queries.
.
Not all management commands modify data or metadata. The large class of commands that start with.show, are used to display metadata or data. For example, the.show tablescommand returns a list of all tables in the current database.
.show
.show tables
For more information on management commands, seeManagement commands overview.
