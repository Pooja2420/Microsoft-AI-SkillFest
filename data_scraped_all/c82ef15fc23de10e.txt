The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud reduces security risk and exposure for machines in your organization. It provides recommendations to improve and remediate security posture. Defender for Servers also protects machines against real-time security threats and attacks.
Note
Support for the Log Analytics agent and Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA) in Defender for Servers has ended. For most plan features, these agents are replaced byagentless machine scanning, or byintegration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
Benefits
Defender for Servers offers several security benefits.
Protect multicloud and on-premises machines: Defender for Servers protects Windows and Linux machines in multicloud environments (Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)) and on-premises.
Centralize management and reporting: Defender for Cloud offers a single view of monitored resources, including machines protected by Defender for Servers. Filter, sort, and cross-reference data to understand, investigate, and analyze machine security.
Integrate with Defender services: Defender for Servers integrates with security capabilities provided by Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.
Improve posture and reduce risk: Defender for Servers assesses the security posture of machines against compliance standards and provides security recommendations to remediate and improve security posture.
Benefit from agentless scanning: Defender for Servers Plan 2 provides agentless machine scanning. Without an agent on endpoints, scan software inventory, assess machines for vulnerabilities, scan for machine secrets, and detect malware threats.
Protect against threats in near real-time: Defender for Servers identifies and analyzes real-time threats and issues security alerts as needed.
Get intelligent threat detection: Defender for Cloud evaluates events and detects threats using advanced security analytics and machine-learning technologies with multiple threat intelligence sources, including theMicrosoft Security Response Center (MSRC).
Defender for Endpoint integration
Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Vulnerability Management integrate into Defender for Cloud.
This integration allows Defender for Servers to use the endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities of Defender for Endpoint. It also enables vulnerability scanning, software inventory, and premium features provided by Defender for Vulnerability Management.
