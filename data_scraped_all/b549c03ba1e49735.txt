There are several scenarios where it is unsuitable to use interactive authentication or to authenticate
as a user account. For example, you may want to submit jobs from a virtual machine (VM), or from a Function App. One option is toauthenticate using a service principal, another option is to configure a managed identity, which this article will explain.
Configure a managed identity
A managed identity allows an application to access other Azure resources (such as your Azure Quantum workspace) and authenticate with these resources.
To configure a managed identity:
Via the Azure portal, locate the resource that you wish to give access to. This resource may be a VM, a Function App, or other application.
Select the resource, and view the overview page.
UnderSettings, selectIdentity.
Configure theStatussetting toOn.
SelectSaveto persist your configuration and confirm the opening dialog withYes.
Grant access to your Azure Quantum workspace
In order to allow the resource to access your Azure Quantum workspace:
Navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace and selectAccess control (IAM)from the left-side menu.
Navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace and selectAccess control (IAM)from the left-side menu.
SelectAddandAdd role assignment.
SelectAddandAdd role assignment.

On theAdd role assignmentpage, selectContributorand selectNext.

Logging in to your Azure Quantum workspace
You should now be able to use your quantum workspace from your chosen resource. For example when using your workspace from within a VM, you will no longer need to authenticate each time.
In some cases, you may also want to specify explicitly within the code to use a Managed Identity Credential:
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential

from azure.quantum import Workspace
workspace = Workspace (
    resource_id = "",
    location = "" ,
    credential=ManagedIdentityCredential()
)
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential

from azure.quantum import Workspace
workspace = Workspace (
    resource_id = "",
    location = "" ,
    credential=ManagedIdentityCredential()
)
