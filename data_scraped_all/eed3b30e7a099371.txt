You can use the Performance Diagnostics tool to identify and troubleshoot performance issues on your Azure virtual machine (VM) in one of two modes:
Continuous diagnostics (preview)collects data at five-second intervals and reports actionable insights about high resource usage every five minutes. Continuous diagnostics (preview) is currently supported only on Windows.
On-demand diagnosticshelps you troubleshoot an ongoing performance issue by providing more in-depth data, insights, and recommendations that are based on data that's collected at a single moment. On-demand diagnostics is supported on both Windows and Linux.
Performance Diagnostics stores all insights and reports in a storage account that you can configure for short data retention to minimize costs.
Run Performance Diagnostics directly from the Azure portal, where you can also review insights and a report about various logs, rich configuration, and diagnostics data. We recommend that you run Performance Diagnostics and review the insights and diagnostics data before you contact Microsoft Support.
This article explains how to use Performance Diagnostics and what the continuous and on-demand modes offer.
Note
Continuous diagnostics (preview) is currently supported only on Windows. On Windows VMs, you'll see the option to enable both on-demand and continuous diagnostics. On Linux VMs, you'll see the option to enable on-demand diagnostics. For more information, seeInstall and run Performance Diagnostics on your VM.
Prerequisites
To run continuous and on-demand diagnostics on Windows, you need.NET SDKversion 4.5 or a later version installed.
Note
To run Performance Diagnostics on classic VMs, seeAzure Performance Diagnostics VM extension.

Install and run Performance Diagnostics on your VM
Performance Diagnostics installs a VM extension that runs a diagnostics tool, called PerfInsights. PerfInsights is available for bothWindowsandLinux.
You can install the Performance Diagnostics tool from three different locations in the Azure portal, depending on your troubleshooting workflow. From your virtual machine, go to:
Overviewâ Monitoring tab
Insightsâ Performance tab
Performance diagnostics
Select one of the following tabs for detailed instructions.
Note
To run Performance Diagnostics, make sure that you have allrequired permissions.

View Performance Diagnostics reports
Note
To download Performance Diagnostics reports, make sure that you have allrequired permissions.
ThePerformance Diagnostics reportstab is available only in thePerformance diagnosticsexperience. It lists all the on-demand diagnostics reports that were run. The list indicates the type of analysis that was run, insights that were found, and their impact levels.

Select a row to view more details.

Performance Diagnostics reports might contain several insights. Every insight includes recommendations.
TheImpactcolumn indicates an impact level of High, Medium, or Low to indicate the potential for performance issues, based on factors such as misconfiguration, known problems, or issues that are reported by other users. You might not yet be experiencing one or more of the listed issues. For example, you might have SQL log files and database files on the same data disk. This condition has a high potential for bottlenecks and other performance issues if the database usage is high. However, you might not notice an issue if the usage is low.
Select theDownload reportbutton to download an HTML report that contains richer diagnostics information, such as storage and network configuration, performance counters, traces, list of processes, and logs. The content depends on the selected analysis. For advanced troubleshooting, the report might contain additional information and interactive charts that are related to high CPU usage, high disk usage, and processes that consume excessive memory. For more information about the Performance Diagnostics report, seeWindowsorLinux.
Note
You can download Performance Diagnostics reports from thePerformance Diagnosticsscreen within 30 days after you generate them. After 30 days, you might receive an error Message when you download a report from thePerformance Diagnosticsscreen. To get a report after 30 days, go to the storage account, and download the report from a binary large object (BLOB) container that's namedazdiagextnresults. You can view the storage account information by using theSettingsbutton on the toolbar.
View and manage storage account and stored data
Performance Diagnostics stores all insights and reports in a storage account that you canconfigure for short data retentionto minimize costs.
To ensure Performance Diagnostics functions correctly, you must enable theAllow storage account key accesssetting for the storage account. To enable this setting, follow these steps:
Navigate to your storage account.
In the storage account settings, locate theConfigurationsection.
Find theAllow storage account key accessoption and set it toEnabled.
Save your changes.
You can use the same storage account for multiple VMs that use Performance Diagnostics. When you change the storage account, the old reports and insights aren't deleted. However, they're no longer displayed in the list of diagnostics reports.
Note
Performance Diagnostics stores insights in Azure tables and stores reports in a binary large object (BLOB) container.
If your storage account usesprivate endpoints, to make sure that Performance Diagnostics can store insights and reports in the storage account:
Create separate private endpoints for Table and BLOB.
Add DNS configuration to each separate private endpoint.

Frequently asked questions
How do I share this data with Microsoft Support?
When you open a support ticket with Microsoft, it's important to share the Performance Diagnostics report from an on-demand Performance Diagnostics run. The Microsoft Support contact provides the option to upload the on-demand Performance Diagnostics report to a workspace. Use either of the following methods to download the on-demand Performance Diagnostics report:
Option 1:Download the report from the Performance Diagnostics blade, as described inView Performance Diagnostics reports.
Option 2:Download the report from the storage account, as described inView and manage storage account and stored data.
How do I capture diagnostics data at the correct time?
We recommend that you run Continuous Performance Diagnostics to capture VM diagnostics data on an ongoing basis.
The On-demand Performance Diagnostics run has the following stages:
Install or update the Performance Diagnostics VM extension
Run the diagnostics for the specified duration
Currently, there's no easy way to know exactly when the VM extension installation is completed. It takes about 45 seconds to 1 minute to install the VM extension. After the VM extension is installed, you can run your repro steps to have On-demand Performance Diagnostics capture the correct set of data for troubleshooting.
Will Performance Diagnostics continue to work if I move my Azure VM across regions?
Azure VMs, and related network and storage resources, can be moved across regions by using Azure Resource Mover. However, moving VM extensions, including the Azure Performance Diagnostics VM extension, across regions isn't supported. You have to manually install the extension on the VM in the target region after you move the VM. For more information, seeSupport matrix for moving Azure VMs between Azure regions.
What is the performance impact of enabling Continuous Performance Diagnostics?
We ran 12-hour tests of Continuous Performance Diagnostics on a range of Windows OS versions, Azure VMs of sizes, and CPU loads.
The test results that are presented in this table show that Continuous Performance Diagnostics provides valuable insights by having a minimal effect on system resources.
Continuous Performance Diagnostics stores insights in a table and a JSON file in a BLOB container. Given that each row is approximately 0.5 KB (kilobyte), and the report is approximately 9 KB before compression, two rows every five minutes plus the corresponding report upload equals 10 KB, or 0.00001 GB.
To calculate the storage cost:
Rows per month: 17,280
Size per row: 0.00001 GB
Total data size:17,280 x 0.000001 = 0.1728 GB
Data storage cost:$0.1728 x  $0.045 = $0.007776
Therefore, assuming steady stress on the VM, the storage cost is estimated to be less than one cent per month, assuming that you use locally redundant storage.
