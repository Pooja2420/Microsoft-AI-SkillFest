Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) supports several built-in allocation policies that determine how it assigns devices across one or more IoT hubs. DPS also includes support for custom allocation policies, which let you create and use your own allocation policies when your IoT scenario requires functionality not provided by the built-in policies.
This article helps you understand how to use and manage DPS allocation policies.
Understand allocation policies
Allocation policies determine how DPS assigns devices to an IoT hub. Each DPS instance has a default allocation policy, but this policy can be overridden by an allocation policy set on an enrollment. Only IoT hubs that have been linked to the DPS instance can participate in allocation. Whether a linked IoT hub will participate in allocation depends on settings on the enrollment that a device provisions through.
DPS supports four allocation policies:
Evenly weighted distribution: devices are provisioned to an IoT hub using a weighted hash. By default, linked IoT hubs have the same allocation weight setting, so they're equally likely to have devices provisioned to them. The allocation weight of an IoT hub may be adjusted to increase or decrease its likelihood of being assigned.Evenly weighted distributionis the default allocation policy for a DPS instance. If you're provisioning devices to only one IoT hub, we recommend using this policy.

If you're provisioning devices to only one IoT hub, we recommend using this policy.
Lowest latency: devices are provisioned to the IoT hub with the lowest latency to the device. If multiple IoT hubs would provide the lowest latency, DPS hashes devices across those hubs based on their configured allocation weight.
Lowest latency: devices are provisioned to the IoT hub with the lowest latency to the device. If multiple IoT hubs would provide the lowest latency, DPS hashes devices across those hubs based on their configured allocation weight.
Static configuration: devices are provisioned to a single IoT hub, which must be specified on the enrollment.

Custom (Use Azure Function): A custom allocation policy gives you more control over how devices are assigned to an IoT hub. This is accomplished by using a custom webhook hosted in Azure Functions to assign devices to an IoT hub. DPS calls your webhook providing all relevant information about the device and the enrollment. Your webhook returns the IoT hub and initial device twin (optional) used to provision the device. Custom payloads can also be passed to and from the device. To learn more, seeUnderstand custom allocation policies. Can't be set as the DPS instance default policy.

Note
The preceding list shows the names of the allocation policies as they appear in the Azure portal. When setting the allocation policy using the DPS REST API, Azure CLI, and DPS service SDKs, they are referred to as follows:hashed,geolatency,static, andcustom.
There are two settings on a linked IoT hub that control how it participates in allocation:
Allocation weight: sets the weight that the IoT hub will have when participating in allocation policies that involve multiple IoT hubs. It can be a value between one and 1000. The default is one (ornull).With theEvenly weighted distributionallocation policy, IoT hubs with higher allocation weight values have a greater likelihood of being selected compared to those with lower weight values.With theLowest latencyallocation policy, the allocation weight value will affect the probability of an IoT hub being selected when more than one IoT hub satisfies the lowest latency requirement.With aCustomallocation policy, whether and how the allocation weight value is used will depend on the webhook logic.

Apply allocation policy: specifies whether the IoT hub participates in allocation policy. The default isYes(true). If set toNo(false), devices won't be assigned to the IoT hub. The IoT hub can still be selected on an enrollment, but it won't participate in allocation. You can use this setting to temporarily or permanently remove an IoT hub from participating in allocation; for example, if it's approaching the allowed number of devices.

When a device provisions through DPS, the service assigns it to an IoT hub according to the following guidelines:
If the enrollment specifies an allocation policy, use that policy; otherwise, use the default allocation policy for the DPS instance.
If the enrollment specifies an allocation policy, use that policy; otherwise, use the default allocation policy for the DPS instance.
If the enrollment specifies one or more IoT hubs, apply the allocation policy across those IoT hubs; otherwise, apply the allocation policy across all of the IoT hubs linked to the DPS instance. Note that if the allocation policy isStatic configuration, the enrollmentmustspecify an IoT hub.
If the enrollment specifies one or more IoT hubs, apply the allocation policy across those IoT hubs; otherwise, apply the allocation policy across all of the IoT hubs linked to the DPS instance. Note that if the allocation policy isStatic configuration, the enrollmentmustspecify an IoT hub.
Important
When you change an allocation policy or the IoT hubs it applies to, the changes only affect subsequent device registrations. Devices already provisioned to an IoT hub won't be affected. If you want your changes to apply retroactively to these devices, you'll need to reprovision them. To learn more, seeHow to reprovision devices.
Set the default allocation policy for the DPS instance
The default allocation policy for the DPS instance is used when an allocation policy isn't specified on an enrollment. OnlyEvenly weighted distribution,Lowest latency, andStatic configurationare supported for the default allocation policy.Customallocation isn't supported. When a DPS instance is created, its default policy is automatically set toEvenly weighted distribution.
Note
If you setStatic configurationas the default allocation policy for a DPS instance, a linked IoT hubmustbe specified in enrollments that rely on the default policy.
Use the Azure portal to the set default allocation policy
To set the default allocation policy for the DPS instance in the Azure portal:
On the left menu of your DPS instance, selectManage allocation policy.
On the left menu of your DPS instance, selectManage allocation policy.
Select the button for the allocation policy you want to set:Lowest latency,Evenly weighted distribution, orStatic configuration. (Custom allocation isn't supported for the default allocation policy.)
Select the button for the allocation policy you want to set:Lowest latency,Evenly weighted distribution, orStatic configuration. (Custom allocation isn't supported for the default allocation policy.)
SelectSave.
SelectSave.
Use the Azure CLI to set the default allocation policy
Use theaz iot dps updateAzure CLI command to set the default allocation policy for the DPS instance. You use--set properties.allocationPolicyto specify the policy. For example, the following command sets the allocation policy toEvenly weighted distribution(the default):
--set properties.allocationPolicy
az iot dps update --name MyExampleDps --set properties.allocationPolicy=hashed
az iot dps update --name MyExampleDps --set properties.allocationPolicy=hashed
DPS also supports setting the default allocation policy using theCreate or Update DPS resourceREST API,Resource Manager templates, and theDPS Management SDKs.
Set allocation policy and IoT hubs for enrollments
Individual enrollments and enrollment groups can specify an allocation policy and the linked IoT hubs that it should apply to. If no allocation policy is specified by the enrollment, then the default allocation policy for the DPS instance is used.
In either case, the following conditions apply:
ForEvenly weighted distribution,Lowest latency, andCustomallocation policies, the enrollmentmayspecify which linked IoT hubs should be used. If no IoT hubs are selected in the enrollment, then all of the linked IoT hubs in the DPS instance will be used.

Use the Azure CLI to manage enrollment allocation policy and IoT hubs
Use theaz iot dps enrollment create,az iot dps enrollment update,az iot dps enrollment-group create,az iot dps enrollment-group updateAzure CLI commands to create or update individual enrollments or enrollment groups.
For example, the following command creates a symmetric key enrollment group that defaults to using the default allocation policy set on the DPS instance and all the IoT hubs linked to the DPS instance:
az iot dps enrollment-group create --dps-name MyExampleDps --enrollment-id MyEnrollmentGroup
az iot dps enrollment-group create --dps-name MyExampleDps --enrollment-id MyEnrollmentGroup
The following command updates the same enrollment group to use theLowest latencyallocation policy with IoT hubs namedMyExampleHubandMyExampleHub-2:
az iot dps enrollment-group update --dps-name MyExampleDps --enrollment-id MyEnrollmentGroup --allocation-policy geolatency --iot-hubs "MyExampleHub.azure-devices.net MyExampleHub-2.azure-devices.net"
az iot dps enrollment-group update --dps-name MyExampleDps --enrollment-id MyEnrollmentGroup --allocation-policy geolatency --iot-hubs "MyExampleHub.azure-devices.net MyExampleHub-2.azure-devices.net"
DPS also supports setting allocation policy and selected IoT hubs on the enrollment using theCreate or Update individual enrollmentandCreate or Update enrollment groupREST APIs, and theDPS service SDKs.
Allocation behavior
Note the following behavior when using allocation policies with IoT hub:
With the Azure CLI, the REST API, and the DPS service SDKs, you can create enrollments with no allocation policy. In this case, DPS uses the default policy for the DPS instance when a device provisions through the enrollment. Changing the default policy setting on the DPS instance will change how devices are provisioned through the enrollment.

In this case, DPS uses the default policy for the DPS instance when a device provisions through the enrollment. Changing the default policy setting on the DPS instance will change how devices are provisioned through the enrollment.
With the Azure portal, the allocation policy setting for the enrollment is pre-populated with the default allocation policy. You can keep this setting or change it to another policy, but, when you save the enrollment, the allocation policy is set on the enrollment. Subsequent changes to the service default allocation policy, won't change how devices are provisioned through the enrollment.
