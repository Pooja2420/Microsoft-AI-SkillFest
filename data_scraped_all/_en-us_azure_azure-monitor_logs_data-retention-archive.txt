Manage data retention in a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace retains data in two states:
Interactive retention: In this state, data is available for monitoring, troubleshooting, and near-real-time analytics.
Long-term retention: In this low-cost state, data isn't available for table plan features, but can be accessed throughsearch jobs.
This article explains how Log Analytics workspaces retain data and how to manage the data retention of tables in your workspace.
Interactive, long-term, and total retention
By default, all tables in a Log Analytics workspace retain data for 30 days, except forlog tables with 90-day default retention. During this period - the interactive retention period - you can retrieve the data from the table through queries, and the data is available for visualizations, alerts, and other features and services, based on the table plan.
You can extend the interactive retention period of tables with the Analytics plan to up to two years. The Basic and Auxiliary plans have a fixed interactive retention period of 30 days.
Note
You can reduce the interactive retention period of Analytics tables to as little as four days using the API or CLI. However, since 31 days of interactive retention are included in the ingestion price, lowering the retention period below 31 days doesn't reduce costs.
To retain data in the same table beyond the interactive retention period, extend the table's total retention to up to 12 years. At the end of the interactive retention period, the data stays in the table for the remainder of the total retention period you configure. During this period - the long-term retention period - run a search job to retrieve the specific data you need from the table and make it available for interactive queries in a search results table.

How retention modifications work
When you shorten a table's total retention, Azure Monitor Logs waits 30 days before removing the data, so you can revert the change and avoid data loss if you made an error in configuration.
When you increase total retention, the new retention period applies to all data that was already ingested into the table and wasn't yet removed.
When you change the long-term retention settings of a table with existing data, the change takes effect immediately.
Example:
You have an existing Analytics table with 180 days of interactive retention and no long-term retention.
You change the interactive retention to 90 days without changing the total retention period of 180 days.
Azure Monitor automatically treats the remaining 90 days of total retention as low-cost, long-term retention, so that data that's 90-180 days old isn't lost.

Configure the default interactive retention period of Analytics tables
The default interactive retention period of all tables in a Log Analytics workspace is 30 days. You can change the default interactive period of Analytics tables to up to two years by modifying the workspace-level data retention setting. Basic and Auxiliary tables have a fixed interactive retention period of 30 days.
Changing the default workspace-level data retention setting automatically affects all Analytics tables to which the default setting still applies in your workspace. If you've already changed the interactive retention of a particular table, that table isn't affected when you change the workspace default data retention setting.
Important
Workspaces with 30-day retention might keep data for 31 days. If you need to retain data for 30 days only to comply with a privacy policy, configure the default workspace retention to 30 days using the API and update theimmediatePurgeDataOn30Daysworkspace property totrue. This operation is currently only supported using theWorkspaces - Update API.

To set the default interactive retention period of Analytics tables within a Log Analytics workspace, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace updatecommand and pass the--retention-timeparameter.
--retention-time
This example sets the table's interactive retention to 30 days:
az monitor log-analytics workspace update --resource-group myresourcegroup --retention-time 30 --workspace-name myworkspace
az monitor log-analytics workspace update --resource-group myresourcegroup --retention-time 30 --workspace-name myworkspace
Use theSet-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspacecmdlet to set the default interactive retention period of Analytics tables within a Log Analytics workspace. This example sets the default interactive retention period to 30 days:
Set-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "MyWorkspace" -RetentionInDays 30
Set-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "MyWorkspace" -RetentionInDays 30
Configure table-level retention
By default, all tables with the Analytics data plan inherit theLog Analytics workspace's default interactive retention settingand have no long-term retention. You can increase the interactive retention period of Analytics tables to up to 730 days at anextra cost.
To add long-term retention to a table with any data plan, settotal retentionto up to 12 years (4,383 days).
Note
Currently, you can set total retention to up to 12 years through the Azure portal and API. CLI and PowerShell are limited to seven years; support for 12 years will follow.

To modify a table's retention settings, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace table updatecommand and pass the--retention-timeand--total-retention-timeparameters.
--retention-time
--total-retention-time
This example sets the table's interactive retention to 30 days, and the total retention to two years, which means that the long-term retention period is 23 months:
az monitor log-analytics workspace table update --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name AzureMetrics --retention-time 30 --total-retention-time 730
az monitor log-analytics workspace table update --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name AzureMetrics --retention-time 30 --total-retention-time 730
To reapply the workspace's default interactive retention value to the table and reset its total retention to 0, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace table updatecommand with the--retention-timeand--total-retention-timeparameters set to-1.
--retention-time
--total-retention-time
-1
For example:
az monitor log-analytics workspace table update --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name Syslog --retention-time -1 --total-retention-time -1
az monitor log-analytics workspace table update --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name Syslog --retention-time -1 --total-retention-time -1
Use theUpdate-AzOperationalInsightsTablecmdlet to modify a table's retention settings. This example sets the table's interactive retention to 30 days, and the total retention to two years, which means that the long-term retention period is 23 months:
Update-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -TableName AzureMetrics -RetentionInDays 30 -TotalRetentionInDays 730
Update-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -TableName AzureMetrics -RetentionInDays 30 -TotalRetentionInDays 730
To reapply the workspace's default interactive retention value to the table and reset its total retention to 0, run theUpdate-AzOperationalInsightsTablecmdlet with the-RetentionInDaysand-TotalRetentionInDaysparameters set to-1.
-RetentionInDays
-TotalRetentionInDays
-1
For example:
Update-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -TableName Syslog -RetentionInDays -1 -TotalRetentionInDays -1
Update-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -TableName Syslog -RetentionInDays -1 -TotalRetentionInDays -1

Portal
API
CLI
PowerShell
To view a table's retention settings in the Azure portal, from theLog Analytics workspacesmenu, selectTables.
TheTablesscreen shows the interactive retention and total retention periods for all the tables in the workspace.

To get the retention setting of a particular table (in this example,SecurityEvent), call theTables - GetAPI:
SecurityEvent
GET /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/MyWorkspaceName/Tables/SecurityEvent?api-version=2022-10-01
GET /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/MyWorkspaceName/Tables/SecurityEvent?api-version=2022-10-01
To get all table-level retention settings in your workspace, don't set a table name.
For example:
GET /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/MyWorkspaceName/Tables?api-version=2022-10-01
GET /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/MyWorkspaceName/Tables?api-version=2022-10-01
To get the retention setting of a particular table, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace table showcommand.
For example:
az monitor log-analytics workspace table show --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name SecurityEvent
az monitor log-analytics workspace table show --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name SecurityEvent
To get the retention setting of a particular table, run theGet-AzOperationalInsightsTablecmdlet.
For example:
Get-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -tableName SecurityEvent
Get-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -tableName SecurityEvent
What happens to data when you delete a table in a Log Analytics workspace?
A Log Analytics workspace can contain severaltypes of tables. What happens when you delete the table is different for each:
table_CL
table_SRCH
(table_RST
Log tables with 90-day default retention
By default, theUsageandAzureActivitytables keep data for at least 90 days at no charge. When you increase the workspace retention to more than 90 days, you also increase the retention of these tables. These tables are also free from data ingestion charges.
Usage
AzureActivity
Tables related to Application Insights resources also keep data for 90 days at no charge. You can adjust the retention of each of these tables individually:
