Microsoft Teams on Azure Virtual Desktop supports chat and collaboration. With media optimizations, it also supports calling and meeting functionality by redirecting it to the local device when using Windows App or the Remote Desktop client on a supported platform. You can still use Microsoft Teams on Azure Virtual Desktop on other platforms without optimized calling and meetings. Teams chat and collaboration features are supported on all platforms.
There are two versions of Teams,Classic TeamsandNew Teams, and you can use either with Azure Virtual Desktop. New Teams has with feature parity with Classic Teams, but improves performance, reliability, and security.
To redirect calling and meeting functionality to the local device, Azure Virtual Desktop uses an extra component. This component is eitherSlimCoreor theWebRTC Redirector Service. The option you use depends on the following:
New Teams can use either SlimCore or the WebRTC Redirector Service. If you use SlimCore, you should also install the WebRTC Redirector Service. This allows a user to fall back to WebRTC, such as if they roam between different devices that don't support the new optimization architecture. For more information about SlimCore, seeNew VDI solution for Teams.

Customize Remote Desktop Protocol properties for a host pool
Customizing a host pool's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) properties, such as multi-monitor experience or enabling microphone and audio redirection, lets you deliver an optimal experience for your users based on their needs.
Enabling device redirections isn't required when using Teams with media optimization. If you're using Teams without media optimization, set the following RDP properties to enable microphone and camera redirection:
audiocapturemode:i:1enables audio capture from the local device and redirects audio applications in the remote session.
audiocapturemode:i:1
audiomode:i:0plays audio on the local computer.
audiomode:i:0
camerastoredirect:s:*redirects all cameras.
camerastoredirect:s:*
