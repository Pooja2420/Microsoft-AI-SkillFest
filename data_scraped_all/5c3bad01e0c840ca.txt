While activity logs are available for each Azure resource from the Azure portal, Azure Health Data Services emits resource logs, which include two categories of logs: AuditLogs and DiagnosticLogs.
AuditLogs provide audit trails for healthcare services. For example, a caller's IP address and resource URL are logged when a user or application accesses the FHIR service. Each service emits required properties and optionally implements other properties.
DiagnosticLogs provide insight into the operation of the service, for example, log level (information, warning, or error), and log message.
Here's an example of the AuditLog:

    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/xxx/RESOURCEGROUPS/xxx/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.HEALTHCAREAPIS/SERVICES/xxx",
    "operationName": "Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services/fhir-R4/search-type",
    "category": "AuditLogs",
    "resultType": "Started",
    "resultSignature": 0,
    "durationMs": 0,
    "callerIpAddress": "::ffff:73.164.17.31",
    "correlationId": "5d04211aaf172d43b83d9eb500464ec5",
    "identity": {
        "claims": {
            "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/xxx/",
            "oid": "xxx"
        }
    },
    "level": "Informational",
    "location": "South Central US",
    "uri": "https://xxx.azurehealthcareapis.com:443/Patient",
    "properties": {
        "fhirResourceType": "Patient"
    }
}
