TheFlexibleservice level is currently in preview and supported in all Azure NetApp Files regions. You must submit a waitlist request to access the Flexible service level by usingthe request form. After you submit the waitlist request, it can take approximately one week to enable the feature.Check the status of feature registration with the command:Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFFlexibleServiceLevelYou can also useAzure CLI commandsaz feature showto register the feature and display the registration status.

Considerations
If you're using theFlexibleservice level:The Flexible service level is only available for manual QoS capacity pools.The Flexible service level is only available on newly created capacity pools. You can't convert an existing capacity pool to use the Flexible service level.Flexible service level capacity pools can't be converted to the Standard, Premium, or Ultra service level.The minimum throughput for Flexible service level capacity pools is 128 MiB/second. Maximum throughput is calculated based on the size of the capacity pool using the formula 5 x 128 x capacity pool size in TiB. If your capacity pool is 1 TiB, the maximum is 640 MiB/second (5 x 128 x 1). For more examples, seeService levels for Azure NetApp Files.You can increase the throughput of a Flexible service level pool at any time. Decreases to throughput on Flexible service level capacity pools can only occur following a 24-hour cool-down period. The 24-hour cool-down period initiates after any change to the throughput of the Flexible service level capacity pool.Cool access isn't currently supported with the Flexible service level.Only single encryption is currently supported for Flexible service level capacity pools.Volumes in Flexible service level capacity pools can't be moved to capacity pools of a different service level. Similarly, you can't move volumes from capacity pools with different service levels into a Flexible service level capacity pool.

You can change the size of a capacity pool in 1-TiB increments.NoteYou can only take advantage of the 1-TiB minimum if all the volumes in the capacity pool are using Standard network features. 1-TiB capacity pools are generally available. If any volume is using Basic network features, the minimum size is 4 TiB.ThroughputThis option is only available for Flexible service level capacity pools. The minimum value is 128 MiB/second. Maximum throughput depends on the size of the capacity pool.
