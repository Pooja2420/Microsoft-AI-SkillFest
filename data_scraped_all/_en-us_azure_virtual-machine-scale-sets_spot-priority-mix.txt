Applies to:âï¸ Flexible scale sets
Azure allows you to have the flexibility of running a mix of uninterruptible standard VMs and interruptible Spot VMs for Virtual Machine Scale Set deployments. You're able to deploy this Spot Priority Mix using Flexible orchestration to easily balance between high-capacity availability and lower infrastructure costs according to your workload requirements. This feature allows you to easily manage your scale set capability to achieve the following goals:
Reduce compute infrastructure costs by applying the deep discounts of Spot VMs
Maintain capacity availability through uninterruptible standard VMs in the scale set deployment
Provide reassurance that all your VMs won't be taken away simultaneously due to evictions before the infrastructure has time to react and recover the evicted capacity
Simplify the scale-out and scale-in of compute workloads that require both Spot and standard VMs by letting Azure orchestrate the creation and deletion of VMs
Limitations
Spot Priority Mix is not supported withsinglePlacementModeenabled on the scale set.
singlePlacementMode
Configure your mix
You can configure a custom percentage distribution across Spot and standard VMs. The platform automatically orchestrates each scale-out and scale-in operation to achieve the desired distribution by selecting an appropriate number of VMs to create or delete. You can also optionally configure the number of base standard VMs you would like to maintain in the Virtual Machine Scale Set during any scale operation.
The eviction policy of your Spot VMs follows what is set for the Spot VMs in your scale set.Deallocateis the default behavior, wherein evicted Spot VMs move to a stop-deallocated state. Alternatively, the Spot eviction policy can be set toDelete, wherein the VM and its underlying disks are deleted.
Scale-In Policy
When using Spot Priority Mix, your scale-in policy for the scale set will operate to try to maintain the percentage split of the Spot and Standard VMs in your scale set. Spot Priority Mix will determine if Spot or Standard VMs need to be removed during scale-in actions to maintain your percentage split, rather than deleting the oldest or newest VM.
ARM Template
You can set your Spot Priority Mix by using an ARM template to add the following properties to a scale set with Flexible orchestration using a Spot priority VM profile:
"priorityMixPolicy": {
    "baseRegularPriorityCount": 0,
    "regularPriorityPercentageAboveBase": 50
},
"priorityMixPolicy": {
    "baseRegularPriorityCount": 0,
    "regularPriorityPercentageAboveBase": 50
},
Parameters:
baseRegularPriorityCountâ Specifies a base number of VMs that are standard,Regularpriority; if the Scale Set capacity is at or below this number, all VMs areRegularpriority.
baseRegularPriorityCount
regularPriorityPercentageAboveBaseâ Specifies the percentage split ofRegularandSpotpriority VMs that are used when the Scale Set capacity is above thebaseRegularPriorityCount.

You can set your Spot Priority Mix in the Spot tab of the Virtual Machine Scale Sets creation process in the Azure portal. The following steps instruct you on how to access this feature during that process.
Log in to theAzure portal.
In the search bar, search for and selectVirtual Machine Scale Sets.
SelectCreateon theVirtual Machine Scale Setspage.
In theBasicstab, fill out the required fields, selectFlexibleas theOrchestrationmode, and select the checkbox forRun with Azure Spot discount.
In theSpottab, select the check-box next toScale with VMs and Spot VMsoption under theScale with VMs and discounted Spot VMssection.
Fill out theBase VM (uninterruptible) countandInstance distributionfields to configure your percentage split between Spot and Standard VMs.
Continue through the Virtual Machine Scale Set creation process.

Updating your Spot Priority Mix
Should your ideal percentage split of Spot and Standard VMs change, you can update your Spot Priority Mix after your scale set has been deployed. Updating your Spot Priority Mix will apply for all scale set actionsafterthe change is made, existing VMs will remain as is.
Portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
You can update your existing Spot Priority Mix in the Configuration tab of the Virtual Machine Scale Set resource page in the Azure portal. The following steps instruct you on how to access this feature during that process. Note: in Portal, you can only update the Spot Priority Mix for scale sets that already have Spot Priority Mix enabled.

Navigate to the specific virtual machine scale set that you're adjusting the Spot Priority Mix on.
In the left side bar, scroll down to and selectConfiguration.
Your current Spot Priority Mix should be visible. Here you can change theBase VM (uninterruptible) countandInstance distributionof Spot and Standard VMs.

Examples
The following examples have scenario assumptions, a table of actions, and walk-through of results to help you understand how Spot Priority Mix configuration works.
Some important terminology to notice before referring to these examples:
sku.capacityis the total number of VMs in the Virtual Machine Scale Set
Base (standard) VMsare the number of standard non-Spot VMs, akin to a minimum VM number
Scenario 1
The following scenario assumptions apply to this example:
sku.capacityis variable, as  Autoscale will add or remove VMs from the scale set
Base (standard) VMs:10
Extra standard VMs:0
Spot priority VMs:0
regularPriorityPercentageAboveBase:50%
Eviction policy:Delete
Example walk-through:
You start out with a Virtual Machine Scale Set with 10 VMs.Thesku.capacityis variable and doesn't set a starting number of VMs. The Base VMs are set at 10, thus your total starting VMs are just 10 Base (standard) VMs.
Thesku.capacityis variable and doesn't set a starting number of VMs. The Base VMs are set at 10, thus your total starting VMs are just 10 Base (standard) VMs.
sku.capacity
You then scale-out 5 times, with 50% standard VMs and 50% Spot VMs.Note, because there's a 50/50 split, in the fourth scale-out, there's one more Spot VM than standard VM. Once it's scaled out again (5th scale-out), the 50/50 balance is restored with another standard VM.
Note, because there's a 50/50 split, in the fourth scale-out, there's one more Spot VM than standard VM. Once it's scaled out again (5th scale-out), the 50/50 balance is restored with another standard VM.
You then scale in your scale set with the eviction policy beingevict-delete, which deletes all the Spot VMs.
With the scale-out operations mentioned in this scenario, you restore the 50/50 balance in your scale set by only creating Spot VMs.
By the last scale-out, your scale set is already balanced, so one of each type of VM is created.
Scenario 2
The following scenario assumptions apply to this example:
sku.capacityis variable, defined by autoscaler; starting with 20
Base (standard) VMs:10
Extra standard VMs:2
Spot priority VMs:8
regularPriorityPercentageAboveBase:25%
Eviction policy:Deallocate
Example walk-through:
With the initial creation of the Virtual Machine Scale Set and Spot Priority Mix, you have 20 VMs.10 of those VMs are the Base (standard) VMs, 2 extra standard VMs, and 8 Spot priority VMs for your 25%regularPriorityPercentageAboveBase.Another way to look at this ratio is you have 1 standard VM for every 4 Spot VMs in the scale set.
10 of those VMs are the Base (standard) VMs, 2 extra standard VMs, and 8 Spot priority VMs for your 25%regularPriorityPercentageAboveBase.
Another way to look at this ratio is you have 1 standard VM for every 4 Spot VMs in the scale set.
You then scale out twice to create 90 more VMs; 23 standard VMs and 67 Spot VMs.
When you scale in by 10 VMs, 10 Spot VMs arestop-deallocated, creating an imbalance in your scale set.
Your next scale out operation creates another 2 standard VMs and 8 Spot VMs, bringing you closer to your 25% above base ratio.
Troubleshooting
If Spot Priority Mix isn't available to you, be sure to configure thepriorityMixPolicyto specify aSpotpriority in thevirtualMachineProfile. Without enabling thepriorityMixPolicysetting, you won't be able to access this Spot feature.

FAQs
Q: I changed the Spot Priority Mix settings, why aren't my existing VMs changing?
Spot Priority Mix applies for scale actions on the scale set. Changing the percentage split of Spot and Standard VMs won't rebalance existing scale set. You'll see the actual percentage split change as you scale the scale set.
Q: Is Spot Priority Mix enabled for Uniform orchestration mode?
Spot Priority Mix is only available on Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Flexible orchestration mode.
Q: Which regions is Spot Priority Mix enabled in?
Spot VMs, and therefore Spot Priority Mix, are available in all global Azure regions.
