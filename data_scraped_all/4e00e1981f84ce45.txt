The ND A100 v4 series virtual machine(VM) is a new flagship addition to the Azure GPU family. These sizes are designed for high-end Deep Learning training and tightly coupled scale-up and scale-out HPC workloads.
The ND A100 v4 series starts with a single VM and eight NVIDIA Ampere A100 40GB Tensor Core GPUs. ND A100 v4-based deployments can scale up to thousands of GPUs with an 1.6 TB/s of interconnect bandwidth per VM. Each GPU within the VM is provided with its own dedicated, topology-agnostic 200 GB/s NVIDIA Mellanox HDR InfiniBand connection. These connections are automatically configured between VMs occupying the same Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set, and support GPU Direct RDMA.
Each GPU features NVLINK 3.0 connectivity for communication within the VM with 96 physical 2nd-generation AMD Epycâ¢ 7V12 (Rome) CPU cores behind them.
These instances provide excellent performance for many AI, ML, and analytics tools that support GPU acceleration 'out-of-the-box,' such as TensorFlow, Pytorch, Caffe, RAPIDS, and other frameworks. Additionally, the scale-out InfiniBand interconnect supports a large set of existing AI and HPC tools that are built on NVIDIA's NCCL2 communication libraries for seamless clustering of GPUs.

Introduction to Azure managed disks
Azure managed disk types

1Temp disk speed often differs between RR (Random Read) and RW (Random Write) operations. RR operations are typically faster than RW operations. The RW speed is usually slower than the RR speed on series where only the RR speed value is listed.
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
