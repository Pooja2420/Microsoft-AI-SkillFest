View protected files with Microsoft Purview Information Protection viewer
You can often view a protected file by simply opening it. For example, you might double-click an attachment in an email message, a document in File Explorer, or a link to a file and be able to open the protected file.
If you are trying to open a protected file that has a.pfilename extension, like a.ppng, you will need to use the Microsoft Purview Information Protection viewer or the Azure Information Protection mobile viewer (AIP mobile viewer). These viewers can open protected text files, protected image files, protected PDF files, and all files that have a.pfilefile name extension on Windows, Android, or iOS.
If you are trying to open a protected PDF, then you also have the option of using a supported PDF reader, such as Microsoft Edge, to open it. For more information, seeView protected PDFs using Microsoft Edge on Windows or Mac.
