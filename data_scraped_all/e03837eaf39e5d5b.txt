The Log Analytics tool in the Azure portal lets you run and edit log queries against data in the Azure Monitor Logs store. It offers two modes that make log data simpler to explore and analyze for both basic and advanced users:
Simple modeprovides the most commonly used Azure Monitor Logs functionality in an intuitive, spreadsheet-like experience. Just point and click to filter, sort, and aggregate data to get to the insights you need most of the time.

Whether you work with the results of your queries interactively or use them with other Azure Monitor features, such as log search alerts or workbooks. Log Analytics is the tool that you use to write and test them.
This article describes the Log Analytics user interface and its features. If you want to jump right into a tutorial, seeLog Analytics tutorial.

This video shows an earlier version of the user interface, but the screenshots throughout this article are up to date and reflect the current UI.
Open Log Analytics
To open Log Analytics in the Azure portal, selectLogseither inAzure Monitor, in aLog Analytics workspace, or from a specific resource. The tool is always the same, but where you start determines the data that's available.
When you openLogsfromAzure Monitoror aLog Analytics workspaces, you have access to all of the records in a workspace. When you selectLogsfrom another type of resource, your data is limited to log data for that resource. For more information, seeLog query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics.

When you start Log Analytics, a dialog appears that containsexample queries. The queries are categorized by solution. Browse or search for queries that match your requirements. You might find one that does exactly what you need. You can also load one to the editor and modify it as required. Browsing through example queries is a good way to learn how to write your own queries.
If you want to start with an empty script and write it yourself, close the example queries. If you want to access the example queries again, selectQueries hubat the top of the screen or through the left sidebar.

Simple mode
KQL mode
In simple mode, the top bar has controls for working with data and switching to KQL mode.

Note
In simple mode, the top action bar doesn't include aRunbutton. The results update automatically as the user refines the query.
In KQL mode, the top bar has controls for working with a query and switching to simple mode.

Left sidebar
The collapsible left pane gives you access to tables, example and saved queries, functions, and query history.
Pin the left pane to keep it open while you work, or maximize your query window by selecting an icon from the left pane only when you need it.

Note
TheTablesview doesn't show empty tables by default.
To change that for thecurrent session, open the context menu...next to the search bar, then selectShow tables with no data.

Query window
Note
The query window is only available in KQL mode.
The query window is where you edit your query. IntelliSense is used for KQL commands and color coding enhances readability. Select+at the top of the window to open another tab.
A single window can include multiple queries. A query can't include any blank lines, so you can separate multiple queries in a window with one or more blank lines. The current query is the one with the cursor positioned anywhere in it.
To run the current query, select theRunbutton or selectShift+Enter.
Results window
The results of a query appear in the results window. By default, the results are displayed as a table. To display the results as a chart, selectChartin the results window. You can also add arendercommand to your query.
The results view displays query results in a table organized by columns and rows.
Click to the left of a row to expand its values.
Select theColumnsdropdown to change the list of columns.
Sort the results by selecting a column name.
Filter the results by selecting the funnel next to a column name.
Clear the filters and reset the sorting by running the query again.
SelectGroup columnsto display the grouping bar above the query results.
Group the results by any column by dragging it to the bar.
Create nested groups in the results by adding more columns.
The chart view displays the results as one of multiple available chart types. You can specify the chart type in arendercommand in your query (KQL mode). You can also select it from the collapsibleChart formattingsection to the right.

More tools
This section describes more tools available above the query area of the screen, as shown in this screenshot, from left to right.

Note
Tabs represent the query history of your current session. In simple mode, you can only use one query per tab.

Relationship to Azure Data Explorer
If you've worked with the Azure Data Explorer web UI, Log Analytics should look familiar. It's built on top of Azure Data Explorer and uses the same Kusto Query Language.
Log Analytics adds features specific to Azure Monitor, such as filtering by time range and the ability to create an alert rule from a query. Both tools include an explorer that lets you scan through the structure of available tables. The Azure Data Explorer web UI primarily works with tables in Azure Data Explorer databases. Log Analytics works with tables in a Log Analytics workspace.
