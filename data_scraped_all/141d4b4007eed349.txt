To improve collaboration between development and IT teams, Azure Pipelines supports integration with ServiceNow. Teams can reduce the risks associated with changes and follow service management methodologies such as Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) by including change management gates in release pipelines.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Configure ServiceNow instances.
Include the ServiceNow change management process as a release gate.
Monitor the change management process from release pipelines.
Keep ServiceNow change requests updated with deployment results.
Prerequisites
Have a HI account in a nondeveloper instance ofServiceNow.
Have an Azure DevOpsorganizationandprojectwith organization-level permissions to install extensions.
Have either aClassic release pipeline, or aYAML pipelinethat deploys to an environment, in your Azure DevOps project.
Make sure you understand and can follow the procedures inUse gates and approvals to control your deploymentandDefine approvals and checks.
Configure the ServiceNow instance
Install theAzure Pipelines extensionon your ServiceNow instance. SeeBuying Overviewfor more details on installing apps from the ServiceNow store. You needHIcredentials to complete the installation.

In ServiceNow, create a new user for the Azure Pipelines Service Account and grant it thex_mioms_azpipeline.pipelinesExecutionrole.

Set up the Azure DevOps organization and project
In your Azure DevOps organization, install theServiceNow Change Management extension.
In your Azure DevOps organization, install theServiceNow Change Management extension.

In your Azure DevOps project, create a new ServiceNow service connection by using eitherBasic authenticationorOAuth2 authentication. For more information, seeCreate a service connection.

Configure the pipeline
You can add ServiceNow integration to a Classic release pipeline or to a YAML pipeline that deploys to an environment.

Add the ServiceNow Change Management pre-deployment gate
In your Azure Pipelines release pipeline, select thePre-deployment conditionsicon.
In your Azure Pipelines release pipeline, select thePre-deployment conditionsicon.
On thePre-deployment conditionsscreen, expand and enableGates, selectAddnext toDeployment gates, and select theServiceNow Change Managementpre-deployment gate.

Add the ServiceNow Change Management check
In your Azure DevOps project, selectPipelines>Environmentsin the left menu, and select the environment that your YAML pipeline deploys to.

Configure ServiceNow Change Management settings
On theServiceNow Change Managementsettings screen, underServiceNow connection, select the ServiceNow service connection you created earlier.

UnderPlanned start dateandPlanned end date, enter UTC date and time in formatyyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ.DescriptionOptionally, enter a detailed description of the change.CategoryOptionally select the category of the change, such asHardware,Network, orSoftware.PriorityOptionally select the priority of the change.RiskOptionally select the risk level for the change.ImpactOptionally select the effect that the change has on business.Configuration itemOptionally select the configuration item that the change applies to.Assignment groupOptionally select the group that the change is assigned to.Advanced>Additional change request parametersSelect the ellipsis next to the field and then selectAddto add more parameters. Names must be field names, not labels, prefixed withu_, such asu_backout_plan. Values must be valid in ServiceNow. Invalid entries are ignored.Success criteriaSelect eitherDesired state of change requestorAdvanced success criteria.Desired state of change requestSelect the change request status value necessary for the gate to succeed and the pipeline to continue.Advanced success criteriaEnter an expression that controls when the gate should succeed. The change request is defined asroot['result']in the response from ServiceNow. For example,and(eq(root['result'].state, 'New'),eq(root['result'].risk, 'Low')). For more information, seeExpressions.Output Variables>Reference nameTo be able to use output variables in your deployment workflow, specify a reference name. You can access gate variables by usingPREDEPLOYGATEas a prefix in an agentless job. For example, when the reference name is set togate1, you can get the change request number by using the variable$(PREDEPLOYGATE.gate1.CHANGE_REQUEST_NUMBER).Variables listCHANGE_REQUEST_NUMBERis the number of the change request.CHANGE_SYSTEM_IDis the System ID of the change request.

Update the pipeline
At the end of your release pipeline, add anAgentless jobwith the taskUpdate ServiceNow Change Request.

In the task settings form, underServiceNow connection, select your ServiceNow service connection.
In the task settings form, underServiceNow connection, select your ServiceNow service connection.
UnderChange request number, enter the ServiceNow change request number to update.
UnderChange request number, enter the ServiceNow change request number to update.
SelectUpdate status, and then underUpdated status of change request, choose or enter the status to set for the change request.
SelectUpdate status, and then underUpdated status of change request, choose or enter the status to set for the change request.

InWork NotesunderAdvanced, optionally enter any work notes to be added for the change request update.

Note
The Update ServiceNow Change Request task fails if none of the change request fields are updated during execution. ServiceNow ignores invalid fields and values passed to the task.
Create a release
SelectCreate releaseto start a new release.
Your pipeline should create a new change request in ServiceNow as part of the pre-deployment conditions you created earlier.

The pipeline waits for all the gates to succeed within the same sample interval. To check the change number, select the status icon to view your pipeline logs.

The change request is queued in ServiceNow, and the change owner can view it.

You can find the release pipeline that triggered the new change request under theAzure DevOps Pipeline metadatasection.

When the change is ready for implementation and moved toImplementstate, the pipeline resumes execution and the gate status should returnsucceeded.

The change request closes automatically after deployment.
Add the YAML task
To update the change request, add the followingserver jobandUpdateServiceNowChangeRequest@2task to your YAML pipeline.
UpdateServiceNowChangeRequest@2

- stage: Stage1
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployLatest
    environment: <environment-name>

For example:

Run the pipeline
Save and run your pipeline. A new change request is automatically created, and the pipeline pauses and waits for the checks to complete. When the checks complete, the pipeline resumes execution.

The change request closes automatically after deployment.

Can I update custom fields in the change request with more change request parameters?

How can I see dropdown values populated for Category, Status, and other fields?
Change Management Core and Change Management - State Model plugins must be active on your ServiceNow instance for the dropdowns to work. For more information, seeUpgrade change managementandUpdate change request states.
