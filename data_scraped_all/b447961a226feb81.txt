dependsOn
Useapproval checksto manually control when a stage should run.
These checks are commonly used to control deployments to production environments.
Checks are a mechanism available to theresource owner.
They control when a stage in a pipeline consumes a resource.
As an owner of a resource like an environment, you can define checks that are required before a stage that consumes the resource can start.
Currently, manual approval checks are supported onenvironments.

Examples
This example runs three stages, one after another.
The middle stage runs two jobs in parallel.
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - script: echo Building!
- stage: Test
  jobs:
  - job: TestOnWindows
    steps:
    - script: echo Testing on Windows!
  - job: TestOnLinux
    steps:
    - script: echo Testing on Linux!
- stage: Deploy
  jobs:
  - job: Deploy
    steps:
    - script: echo Deploying the code!
stages:
- stage: Build
