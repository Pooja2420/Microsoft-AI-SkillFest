This article describes how to allow, limit, or prevent public access to your Azure Data Explorer cluster.
Manage public access
To allow, limit, or prevent public access to your cluster, follow these steps:
In theAzure portal, go to your cluster.
In theAzure portal, go to your cluster.
From the left-hand menu, underSecurity + Networking, selectNetworking. If you select theEnabled from selected IP addressesoption, you must specify the IP address or CIDR using the IPv4 address format.

Within thePublic network accessarea, select one of the following three options:Enabled from all networks: This option allows access from public networks.Enabled from selected IP addresses: This option allows you to define a firewall allowlist of IP addresses, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, orservice tagsthat can connect to the public endpoint of your cluster. In CIDR notation, the IP address is followed by a slash and a number that represents the subnet mask. For more information, seeSpecify selected IP addresses.Disabled: This option prevents access to the cluster from public networks and instead requires connection through a private endpoint.

Specify selected IP addresses
TheEnabled from selected IP addressesoption provides flexibility in managing network access to your cluster by offering multiple ways to define the IP addresses that can connect. You can specify individual IP addresses, use CIDR notation to define a range of IP addresses, or utilizeservice tags, which represent a group of IP address prefixes from specific Azure services. The followingexamplesshow how each can be specified.
The following examples show how to specify IP addresses, CIDR notations, and service tags.
The following example specifies a single IP address in the formatxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.10
The following example specifies a range of IP addresses from192.168.1.0to192.168.1.255using CIDR notation. The/24indicates that the first 24 bits, or three octets, represent the network part of the address, while the last eight bits are used for the host addresses within the network from0to255.
192.168.1.0
192.168.1.255
/24
0
255
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.1.0/24
The following example uses a service tag to allow access to the Azure Storage IP address range from the Azure Data Center in the West US region.
Storage.WestUS
Storage.WestUS
For a full list of service tags, seeAvailable service tags.
You can configure the selected IP addresses either through the Azure portal or by modifying the ARM template. Choose the method that best aligns with your workflow, requirements, and network access management needs.
