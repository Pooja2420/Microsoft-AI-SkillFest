When you commit to a reserved instance ofAzure VMware Solution, you save money. The reservation discount automatically applies to the running Azure VMware Solution hosts that match the reservation scope and attributes. In addition, a reserved instance purchase covers only the compute part of your usage and includes software licensing costs.
Purchase restriction considerations
Reserved instances are available with some exceptions:
Clouds: Reservations are available only in the regions listed on theProducts available by regionpage.
Insufficient quota: A reservation scoped to a single or shared subscription must have hosts quota available in the subscription for the new reserved instance. You cancreate a quota increase requestto resolve this issue.
Offer eligibility: You need anAzure Enterprise Agreement (EA)with Microsoft.
Capacity restrictions: In rare circumstances, Azure limits the purchase of new reservations for Azure VMware Solution host SKUs because of low capacity in a region.

You can buy a reserved instance of an Azure VMware Solution host instance in theAzure portal.
You can pay for the reservationupfront or with monthly payments.
These requirements apply to buying a reserved dedicated host instance:

For EA subscriptions, you must enable theAdd Reserved Instancesoption in theEA portal. If disabled, you must be an EA Admin for the subscription to enable it.
