Import and export work items in bulk using CSV-formatted files in Azure Boards. While you can continue to use Excel for bulk imports and updates, the native import/export feature allows you to manage work items without requiring Excel. For more information, seeBulk add or modify work items with Excel.
Prerequisites
Permissions:
Export work items: Member of theProject Administratorsgroup orView project-level informationpermission set toAllow.
Import work items: Member of theProject AdministratorsorTeam Foundation Administratorssecurity group.
Import new work items
To import work items in bulk, your CSV file must include theWork Item TypeandTitlefields. You can include more fields as needed. Follow these guidelines to import a CSV file:
Exclude the ID field:Don't include theIDfield in your CSV file.
Remove project-specific fields:If the CSV file was exported from a different project, remove fields specific to the source project, such asArea PathandTags. For a list of default fields, seeWork Item Field Index.
Include the Test Steps field:When importing test cases, include theTest Stepsfield. For more information, seeBulk Import or Export Test Cases.
Don't includeAssigned To,Changed Date,Created By, orStatefields.
Validate required fields:Ensure theWork Item TypeandTitlefields are present in the CSV file.Confirm that theWork Item Typecorresponds to a valid type in the target project.Verify that all fields in the CSV file match the fields for the work item types in the target project.
Ensure theWork Item TypeandTitlefields are present in the CSV file.
Confirm that theWork Item Typecorresponds to a valid type in the target project.
Verify that all fields in the CSV file match the fields for the work item types in the target project.
Handle invalid values:If the imported CSV file contains work items with invalid values, you must edit and correct these work items after import before they can be saved.
Do the following steps to import new work items.
Note
You can import up to 1,000 work items at a time. If you have more than 1,000 work items to import, break them into multiple files and import them separately.
Create a localimport.csvfile and open it in Visual Studio Code or Excel.

Tip
Don't assign IDs to new work items that you add. Assigning IDs results in an error message.
The system highlights those work items with data issues. Resolve the data issues before you save the work items. In this example, an invalid value is in the Priority field. Fix the data by opening the work item directly. Instead, usebulk editto fix several work items with the same issue.

Tips
Parent-child links:You can add parent-child links between work items you import by indenting the title columns, as shown inCan I import a CSV file that have parent-child links?. However, you can't specify any other link types when you import or update work items.

Default State field:When you import new work items, theStatefield is set toNewby default. You can't specify a different state during the import process. If you need to change the state of imported work items, use the following workaround:Import the work items with the defaultNewstate.Export the imported work items to a CSV file.Update theStatefield values in the exported CSV file.Reimport the updated CSV file to set the desired states.

Reimport the updated CSV file to set the desired states.
Default Area and Iteration fields:TheAreaandIterationfields default to the top-level node. This behavior occurs because the import process doesn't have the context for these fields unless explicitly specified in the CSV file. To set specificAreaandIterationpaths during import, ensure these fields are included in your CSV file with the correct values. For example:Title,Description,Area Path,Iteration Path
"Sample Work Item","This is a sample description.","Project\Team","Project\Sprint 1"

Update existing work items
To update work items, create a query that contains all the columns you want to export and possibly edit. Save your query and selectExport to CSVto save thedata.csvfile to your local machine.The exported file should look similar to the following example:ID,Work Item Type,Title,Assigned To,State,Tags
"272","Issue","Fix issues with code","Active","",
"273","Issue","Merge testing modules","Active","",
"274","Issue","Open private preview for select customers","Active","",
"275","Issue","Enable feature for customer champs","Active","",
"276","Issue","Remove old test code","Active","",

Make the edits to your work items. Your CSV file must contain theID,Work Item Type, andTitlefields. Any other fields you want to include are optional.NoteWhen you import identity fields, enter the name and email in the following format"Display Name <email>". For example, to assign work to Jamal Hartnett, specify"Jamal Hartnett <fabrikamfiber4@hotmail.com>". If you specify a value that isn't recognized as a valid user to the system, you may encounter problems with the import.In the following example, we change values on existing working items.ID,Work Item Type,Title,Assigned To,State,Tags

Export list as a CSV file
From any query, you can export a list of work items as a comma-delimited list.Open the query, select theactions icon, and then selectExport to CSV.

Export and import work items to a different project
You can use this feature to export work items from one project and import them to another project. But, before you import them to another project, you must remove the work item ID. You get an error if you attempt to import new work items to a project with an ID specified.
Import HTML fields
HTML fields, such as descriptions and acceptance criteria, include rich text formatting. To ensure this formatting is preserved, do the following tasks:
Ensure your CSV file includes HTML tags within the relevant fields.
Import the CSV file into Excel.
Excel might handle multi-line text fields differently, so it's important to check the formatting after import. Replace lines ending inCRLFby surrounding sentences with<p>... </p>.
CRLF
<p>... </p>
For example, you can import the following work item, which includes three lines of text in theDescriptionfield.
Work Item Type,Title,Description
"Product Backlog Item","Hello World Web Site - 8","<p><strong>&nbsp;You can include bold text</strong></p><p><em>&nbsp;And italic text</em></p><p><u>&nbsp;Underline text</u></p>"
Work Item Type,Title,Description
"Product Backlog Item","Hello World Web Site - 8","<p><strong>&nbsp;You can include bold text</strong></p><p><em>&nbsp;And italic text</em></p><p><u>&nbsp;Underline text</u></p>"
Convert multi-line fields to plaintext
To disable HTML in multi-line fields to ensure that they're plaintext, use thewitadmin changefieldcommand. For more information, seeManage Work Item Fields.
witadmin changefield
Example command:
witadmin changefield /collection:CollectionURL /n:FieldName /type:PlainText
witadmin changefield /collection:CollectionURL /n:FieldName /type:PlainText
Handle formatting inconsistencies
When you work with HTML fields across different Microsoft products, you might encounter formatting inconsistencies. Here are some tips to handle these issues:
Review the formatting after importing to ensure it meets your requirements.
Use appropriate HTML tags and structures to minimize discrepancies. You can add multiple tags separated by a semicolon. For more information, seeTasks you can and can't do with Excel.
For more information on managing HTML content and ensuring compatibility, seeProvide help text, hyperlinks, or web content on a work item form.

FAQs
Q: Can I import new items and update existing items in the same CSV file?
A: Absolutely! Leave the ID field empty for any new work items. In the following example, the last entry for an Epic doesn't specify an ID.
ID,Work Item Type,Title,Assigned To,State,Priority,Tags
"16504","Issue","Fix issues with code",,"To Do","1",
"16505","Issue","Merge testing modules",,"To Do","3",
"16506","Issue","Open private preview for select customers",,"To Do","2",
"16507","Issue","Enable feature for customer champs",,"To Do","2",

"16508","Issue","Remove old test code",,"To Do","2",
,"Epic","Track Telemetry for data imports",,"To Do","2",

Q: Can I import a CSV file that has parent-child links?
A: Yes, you can add child work items by indenting title columns. The following example adds three child issues under the already defined Epic.
ID,Work Item Type,Title 1,Title 2,Assigned To,State,Priority,Tags
"165","Epic","Track Telemetry for data imports",,,"To Do","2",
,"Issue",,"Fix issues with code",,"To Do","1",
,"Issue",,"Open private preview for select customers",,"To Do","2",
,"Issue",,"Enable feature for customer champs",,"To Do","2",

,"Issue",,"Fix issues with code",,"To Do","1",
,"Issue",,"Open private preview for select customers",,"To Do","2",
,"Issue",,"Enable feature for customer champs",,"To Do","2",

Q: How do I know if my imported file has errors?
A: You can test by adding tags with spaces and hyphens, for example, and include it in the export. The import should match the same format. Any problems with the formatting of your CSV file appear in the Results page of the import view. You can't import the work items until the formatting and syntax is correct.

The work item results always list the data errors found for individual work items. Fix each error either from the web portal, or in the CSV file and import again.
Q: Why am I getting errors for some identity values?
A: When you use the Web UI, the identity picker goes through extra steps to validate the user. First it checks to see if the person is a valid user in the org. If not, it searches on the identity in Microsoft Entra ID. If the user's in Microsoft Entra ID but not in the org, that user gets added to the valid identities.
When you import from CSV, for performance reasons, the identity picker doesn't go through these extra steps. It only checks to see if there's a matching User Principal Name (UPN) already in the org. If it doesn't find a matching UPN, it reports that the identity is unknown.
