This article summarizes support and prerequisites for disaster recovery of Azure VMs from one Azure region to another, using theAzure Site Recoveryservice.
Deployment method support
Resource move/migrate support
Region support
Azure Site Recovery allows you to perform global disaster recovery. You can replicate and recover VMs between any two Azure regions in the world. If you have concerns around data sovereignty, you may choose to limit replication within your specific geographic cluster.
See hereto find details on the various geographic clusters supported.
Note
Support for restricted Regions reserved for in-country/region disaster recovery:Switzerland West reserved for Switzerland North, France South reserved for France Central, Norway West for Norway East customers, JIO India Central for JIO India West customers, Brazil Southeast for Brazil South customers, South Africa West for South Africa North customers, Germany North for Germany West Central customers, UAE Central for UAE North customers.To use restricted regions as your primary or recovery region, get yourselves allowlisted by raising a requestherefor both source and target subscriptions.

ForBrazil South, you can replicate and fail over to these regions: Brazil Southeast, South Central US, West Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, and North Central US.

Brazil South can only be used as a source region from which VMs can replicate using Site Recovery. It can't act as a target region. Note that if you fail over from Brazil South as a source region to a target, failback to Brazil South from the target region is supported. Brazil Southeast can only be used as a target region.

If the region in which you want to create a vault doesn't show, make sure your subscription has access to create resources in that region.
If the region in which you want to create a vault doesn't show, make sure your subscription has access to create resources in that region.
If you can't see a region within a geographic cluster when you enable replication, make sure your subscription has permissions to create VMs in that region.

New Zealand is only supported as a source or target region for Site Recovery Azure to Azure. However, creating recovery services vault is not supported in New Zealand.

Cache storage
This table summarizes support for the cache storage account used by Site Recovery during replication.
The following table lists the limits in terms of number of disks that can replicate to a single storage account.
As average churn on the disks increases, the number of disks that a storage account can support decreases. The above table may be used as a guide for making decisions on number of storage accounts that need to be provisioned.
Note
The cache limits are specific to Azure-to-Azure and Zone-to-Zone DR scenarios.
When you enable replication via the virtual machine workflow for cross subscription, the portal only lists the cache storage account from the source subscription, but doesn't list any storage account created in the target subscription. To set up this scenario, usePowerShell.
Azure Site Recovery isn't supported for VMs with Premium SSD v2 disks.
Replicated machine operating systems
Site Recovery supports replication of Azure VMs running the operating systems listed in this section. Note that if an already-replicating machine's operating system is later upgraded (or downgraded) to a different major version of the operating system (for example RHEL 8 to RHEL 9), you must disable replication, uninstall Mobility Agent and re-enable replication after the upgrade.

Note
For Linux versions, Azure Site Recovery doesn't support custom OS kernels. Only the stock kernels that are part of the distribution minor version release/update are supported.
Note
To support latest Linux kernels within 15 days of release, Azure Site Recovery rolls out hot fix patch on top of latest mobility agent version. This fix is rolled out in between two major version releases. To update to latest version of mobility agent (including hot fix patch), follow steps mentioned inthis article. This patch is currently rolled out for mobility agents used in Azure to Azure DR scenario.
Note
Enable replication through create virtual machine deployment workflow isn't supported for virtual machines with OS RHEL 9* and above.

Replicated machines - Linux file system/guest storage
File systems: ext3, ext4, XFS, BTRFS
Volume manager: LVM2
Note
Multipath software isn't supported.

Replicated machines - storage
Note
Azure Site Recovery supports storage accounts with page blob for unmanaged disk replication.
Unmanaged disks were deprecated on September 30, 2022, and are slated to retire by September 30, 2025. Managed disks now offers the full capabilities of unmanaged disks, along with additional advancements.
This table summarized support for the Azure VM OS disk, data disk, and temporary disk.
It's important to observe the VM disk limits and targets formanaged disksto avoid any performance issues.
If you deploy with the default settings, Site Recovery automatically creates disks and storage accounts based on the source settings.
If you customize, ensure you follow the guidelines.
Important
To avoid performance issues, make sure that you follow VM disk scalability and performance targets formanaged disks. If you use default settings, Site Recovery creates the required disks and storage accounts, based on the source configuration. If you customize and select your own settings, follow the disk scalability and performance targets for your source VMs.
Limits and data change rates
The following table summarizes Site Recovery limits.
These limits are based on our tests, but obviously don't cover all possible application I/O combinations.
Actual results can vary based on your app I/O mix.
There are two limits to consider, per disk data churn and per virtual machine data churn.
The current limit for per virtual machine data churn is 54 MB/s, regardless of size.
Note
High churn support is now available in Azure Site Recovery where churn limit per virtual machine has increased up to 100 MB/s. For more information, seeAzure VM Disaster Recovery - High Churn Support.
