You can now monitor your stateful workloads running on Azure Container Storage service using managed Prometheus. Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting solution that's widely used in Kubernetes environments to monitor and alert on infrastructure and workload performance.
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheusis a component ofAzure Monitor Metricsthat provides a fully managed and scalable environment for running Prometheus. It enables collecting Prometheus metrics from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to monitor your workloads.
Prometheus metrics are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace, where you can analyze and visualize the data usingAzure Monitor Metrics Explorer with PromQL (preview)andAzure Managed Grafana.
Prerequisites and limitations
This preview feature only supports Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. If you have your own Prometheus instance deployed, then you must disable Azure Container Storage's Prometheus instance by running the following Azure CLI command. Replace<cluster_name>and<resource_group_name>with your own values.
<cluster_name>
<resource_group_name>
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters --cluster-name <cluster_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name azurecontainerstorage --config base.metrics.enablePrometheusStack=false
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters --cluster-name <cluster_name> --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name azurecontainerstorage --config base.metrics.enablePrometheusStack=false
Azure Managed Grafana default dashboard support isn't currently enabled for Azure Container Storage.
Collect Azure Container Storage Prometheus metrics
You can use Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus to collect Azure Container Storage metrics along with other Prometheus metrics from your AKS cluster. To start collecting Azure Container Storage metrics,enable Managed Prometheus on the AKS cluster. If your AKS cluster already has Prometheus enabled, then installing Azure Container Storage on that cluster will automatically start collecting Azure Container Storage metrics.
Scrape frequency
The default scrape frequency for all default targets and scrapes is 30 seconds.
Metrics collected for default targets
The following Azure Container Storage targets are enabled by default, which means you don't have to provide any scrape job configuration for these targets:
acstor-capacity-provisioner(storage pool metrics)
acstor-capacity-provisioner
acstor-metrics-exporter(disk metrics)
acstor-metrics-exporter
You can customize data collection for the default targets using the Managed Prometheus ConfigMap. SeeCustomize scraping of Prometheus metrics in Azure Monitor.
Azure Container Storage provides the following storage pool metrics collected from theacstor-capacity-provisionertarget (job=acstor-capacity-provisioner):
acstor-capacity-provisioner
storage_pool_ready_state
storage_pool_capacity_provisioned_bytes
storage_pool_capacity_used_bytes
storage_pool_snapshot_capacity_reserved_bytes
Azure Container Storage provides the following disk metrics collected from theacstor-metrics-exportertarget (job=acstor-metrics-exporter):
acstor-metrics-exporter
disk_pool_ready_state
disk_read_operations_completed_total
disk_write_operations_completed_total
disk_read_operations_time_seconds_total
disk_write_operations_time_seconds_total
disk_errors_total
disk_read_bytes_total
disk_written_bytes_total
disk_readonly_errors_gauge
Query Azure Container Storage metrics
Azure Container Storage metrics are stored in the Azure Monitor workspace that's associated with managed Prometheus. You can query metrics directly from the workspace or through the Azure Managed Grafana instance that's connected to the workspace.
To view Azure Container Storage metrics, follow these steps:
Sign in to theAzure portaland navigate to your AKS cluster.
Sign in to theAzure portaland navigate to your AKS cluster.
From the service menu, underMonitoring, selectInsights, and then selectMonitor Settings.
From the service menu, underMonitoring, selectInsights, and then selectMonitor Settings.

UnderManaged Prometheus, select the appropriate Azure Monitor workspace instance. On the instance overview page, select theMetricssection, and query the desired metrics.

Alternatively, you can select the Managed Grafana instance, and on the instance overview page, click on the endpoint URL. This will navigate to the Grafana portal where you can query the metrics. The data source will be automatically configured for you to query metrics from the associated Azure Monitor workspace.
