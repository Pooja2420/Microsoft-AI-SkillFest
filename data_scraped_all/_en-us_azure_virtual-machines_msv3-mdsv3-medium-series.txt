The Msv3 and Mdsv3 Medium Memory(MM) Virtual Machine (VM) series, powered by 4thgeneration IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Scalable processors, are the next generation of memory-optimized VM sizes delivering faster performance, lower total cost of ownership (TCO) and improved resilience to failures compared to previous generation Mv2 VMs. The Mv3 MM offers VM sizes of up to 4TB of memory and 4,000 MBps throughput to remote storage and provides up to 25% networking performance improvements over previous generations.

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toReadOnlyorReadWrite.  For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toNone.

Expected network bandwidthis the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth.Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines. To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
