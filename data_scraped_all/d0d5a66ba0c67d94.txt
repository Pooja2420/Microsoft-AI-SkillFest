This article describes how to migrate Azure VM backups from standard to enhanced policy using Azure Backup.
Azure Backup now supports migration to the enhanced policy for Azure VM backups using standard policy. The migration of VM backups to enhanced policy enables you to schedule multiple backups per day (up to every 4 hours), retain snapshots for longer duration, and use multi-disk crash consistency for VM backups. Snapshot-tier recovery points (created using enhanced policy) are zonally resilient. The migration of VM backups to enhanced policy also allows you to migrate your VMs to Trusted Launch and use Premium SSD v2 and Ultra-disks for the VMs without disrupting the existing backups.
Considerations
Before you start the migration, ensure that there are no ongoing backup jobs for the VM that you plan to migrate.
Migration is supported for Managed VMs only and isnât supported for Classic or unmanaged VMs.
Once the migration is complete, you canât change the backup policy back to standard policy.
Migration operations trigger a backup job as part of the migration process and might take up to several hours to complete for large VMs.
The change from standard policy to enhanced policy can result in additional costs.Learn More.
Note
If the VM already has a shared disk attached to it, then perform migration by following these steps:
Detach the shared disk from the VM.
Perform the Policy change.
Reattach the shared disk to implement the exclusion.
