TheauditIfNotExistseffect enables auditing of resourcesrelatedto the resource that matches theifcondition, but don't have the properties specified in thedetailsof thethencondition.

AuditIfNotExists evaluation
auditIfNotExistsruns after a Resource Provider processed a create or update resource request and returned a success status code. The audit occurs if there are no related resources or if the resources defined byExistenceConditiondon't evaluate to true. For new and updated resources, Azure Policy adds aMicrosoft.Authorization/policies/audit/actionoperation to the activity log and marks the resource as non-compliant. When triggered, the resource that satisfied theifcondition is the resource that is marked as non-compliant.

AuditIfNotExists properties
Thedetailsproperty of the AuditIfNotExists effects has all the subproperties that define the related resources to match.
details
type(required)Specifies the type of the related resource to match.Iftypeis a resource type underneath theifcondition resource, the policy queries for resources of thistypewithin the scope of the evaluated resource. Otherwise, policy queries within the same resource group or subscription as the evaluated resource depending on theexistenceScope.
type
Specifies the type of the related resource to match.

name(optional)Specifies the exact name of the resource to match and causes the policy to fetch one specific resource instead of all resources of the specified type.When the condition values forif.field.typeandthen.details.typematch, thennamebecomesrequiredand must be[field('name')], or[field('fullName')]for a child resource. However, anauditeffect should be considered instead.

Note
typeandnamesegments can be combined to generically retrieve nested resources.
type
name
To retrieve a specific resource, you can use"type": "Microsoft.ExampleProvider/exampleParentType/exampleNestedType"and"name": "parentResourceName/nestedResourceName".
"type": "Microsoft.ExampleProvider/exampleParentType/exampleNestedType"
"name": "parentResourceName/nestedResourceName"
To retrieve a collection of nested resources, a wildcard character?can be provided in place of the last name segment. For example,"type": "Microsoft.ExampleProvider/exampleParentType/exampleNestedType"and"name": "parentResourceName/?". This can be combined with field functions to access resources related to the evaluated resource, such as"name": "[concat(field('name'), '/?')]"."
?
"type": "Microsoft.ExampleProvider/exampleParentType/exampleNestedType"
"name": "parentResourceName/?"
"name": "[concat(field('name'), '/?')]"
resourceGroupName(optional)Allows the matching of the related resource to come from a different resource group.Doesn't apply iftypeis a resource that would be underneath theifcondition resource.Default is theifcondition resource's resource group.

existenceScope(optional)Allowed values areSubscriptionandResourceGroup.Sets the scope of where to fetch the related resource to match from.Doesn't apply iftypeis a resource that would be underneath theifcondition resource.ForResourceGroup, would limit to the resource group inresourceGroupNameif specified. IfresourceGroupNameisn't specified, would limit to theifcondition resource's resource group, which is the default behavior.ForSubscription, queries the entire subscription for the related resource. Assignment scope should be set at subscription or higher for proper evaluation.Default isResourceGroup.

evaluationDelay(optional)Specifies when the existence of the related resources should be evaluated. The delay is only
used for evaluations that are a result of a create or update resource request.Allowed values areAfterProvisioning,AfterProvisioningSuccess,AfterProvisioningFailure,
or an ISO 8601 duration between 0 and 360 minutes.TheAfterProvisioningvalues inspect the provisioning result of the resource that was
evaluated in the policy rule'sifcondition.AfterProvisioningruns after provisioning is
complete, regardless of outcome. Provisioning that takes more than six hours, is treated as a
failure when determiningAfterProvisioningevaluation delays.Default isPT10M(10 minutes).Specifying a long evaluation delay might cause the recorded compliance state of the resource to
not update until the nextevaluation trigger.

existenceCondition(optional)If not specified, any related resource oftypesatisfies the effect and doesn't trigger the
audit.Uses the same language as the policy rule for theifcondition, but is evaluated against
each related resource individually.If any matching related resource evaluates to true, the effect is satisfied and doesn't trigger
the audit.Can use [field()] to check equivalence with values in theifcondition.For example, could be used to validate that the parent resource (in theifcondition) is in
the same resource location as the matching related resource.
