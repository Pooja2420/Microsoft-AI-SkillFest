Topology provides an interactive interface to view resources and their relationships in Azure across multiple subscriptions, regions, and resource groups. It helps you manage and monitor your cloud network infrastructure with interactive graphical interface that provides you with insights from Azure Network Watcherconnection monitorandtraffic analytics. Topology helps you diagnose and troubleshoot network issues by providing contextual access to Network Watcher diagnostic tools such asconnection troubleshoot,packet capture, andnext hop.
In this article, you learn how to use topology to visualize virtual networks and connected resources.
Note
Azure Resource Graph is used to draw resources topology. In case of any configuration changes, it might take up to 30 hours for the changes to reflect in Azure Resource Graph and then in topology.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
The necessaryrole-based access control (RBAC) permissionsto use Azure Network Watcher capabilities.
Supported resource types
Topology supports the following resource types:
Application Gateways
Azure Bastion hosts

Drilldown resources
In this section, you learn how to navigate the topology view from regions to the individual Azure resource such as a virtual machine (VM). Once you drill down to the VM, you can see its traffic and connectivity insights. From the VM view, you have access to Network Watcher diagnostic tools such as connection troubleshoot, packet capture and next hop to help in troubleshooting any issues you have with the VM.
SelectScopeto choose the subscriptions and regions of the resources that you want to navigate to. The following example shows one subscription and region selected.

Select the plus sign of the region that has the resource that you want to see to navigate to the region view.In the region view, you see virtual networks and other Azure resources in the region. You see any virtual network peerings in the region so you can understand the traffic flow from and to resources within the region. You can navigate to the virtual network view to see its subnets.
