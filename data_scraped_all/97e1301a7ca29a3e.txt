Every security program includes multiple workflows for incident response. These processes might include notifying relevant stakeholders, launching a change management process, and applying specific remediation steps. Security experts recommend that you automate as many steps of those procedures as you can. Automation reduces overhead. It can also improve your security by ensuring the process steps are done quickly, consistently, and according to your predefined requirements.
This article describes the workflow automation feature of Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This feature can trigger consumption logic apps on security alerts, recommendations, and changes to regulatory compliance. For example, you might want Defender for Cloud to email a specific user when an alert occurs. You'll also learn how to create logic apps usingAzure Logic Apps.

Create a logic app and define when it should automatically run
Follow these steps:
From Defender for Cloud's sidebar, selectWorkflow automation.

Supported triggers
The logic app designer supports the following Defender for Cloud triggers:
When a Microsoft Defender for Cloud Recommendation is created or triggered- If your logic app relies on a recommendation that gets deprecated or replaced, your automation stops working and you need to update the trigger. To track changes to recommendations, use therelease notes.

When a Defender for Cloud Alert is created or triggered- You can customize the trigger so that it relates only to alerts with the severity levels that interest you.

When a Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance assessment is created or triggered- Trigger automations based on updates to regulatory compliance assessments.

Note
If you're using the legacy triggerWhen a response to a Microsoft Defender for Cloud alert is triggered, your logic apps won't be launched by the Workflow Automation feature. Instead, use either of the triggers mentioned above.
After you've defined your logic app, return to the workflow automation definition pane ("Add workflow automation").

Manually trigger a logic app
You can also run logic apps manually when viewing any security alert or recommendation.

Configure workflow automation at scale
Automating your organization's monitoring and incident response processes can greatly improve the time it takes to investigate and mitigate security incidents.
To deploy your automation configurations across your organization, use the supplied Azure Policy 'DeployIfNotExist' policies described below to create and configure workflow automation procedures.
Get started withworkflow automation templates.
To implement these policies:
From the table below, select the policy you want to apply:GoalPolicyPolicy IDWorkflow automation for security alertsDeploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alertsf1525828-9a90-4fcf-be48-268cdd02361eWorkflow automation for security recommendationsDeploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations73d6ab6c-2475-4850-afd6-43795f3492efWorkflow automation for regulatory compliance changesDeploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance509122b9-ddd9-47ba-a5f1-d0dac20be63cYou can also find these by searching Azure Policy.

Review the summary page and selectCreate.Data types schemasTo view the raw event schemas of the security alerts or recommendations events passed to the logic app, visit theWorkflow automation data types schemas. This can be useful in cases where you aren't using Defender for Cloud's built-in Logic Apps connectors mentioned above, but instead are using the generic HTTP connector - you could use the event JSON schema to manually parse it as you see fit.
