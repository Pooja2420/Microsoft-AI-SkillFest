This article explains how to back upAzure Managed Diskfrom the Azure portal. You can also use REST API tocreate a Backup policyandconfigure backupfor Azure Managed Disk.
Learn about theAzure Disk backup region availability, supported scenarios and limitations.
Create a Backup vault
A Backup vault is a storage entity in Azure that holds backup data for various newer workloads that Azure Backup supports, such as Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers and Azure Disks. Backup vaults make it easy to organize your backup data, while minimizing management overhead. Backup vaults are based on the Azure Resource Manager model of Azure, which provides enhanced capabilities to help secure backup data.

In theBasicstab, provide policy name, selectDatasource typeasAzure Disk. The vault is already prepopulated and the selected vault properties are presented.NoteAlthough the selected vault may have the global-redundancy setting, currently Azure Disk Backup supports snapshot datastore only. All backups are stored in a resource group in your subscription and aren't copied to backup vault storage.

In theBackup policytab, select the backup schedule frequency.Azure Disk Backup offers multiple backups per day. If you require more frequent backups, choose theHourlybackup frequency with the ability to take backups with intervals of every1,2,4,6,8, or12hours. The backups are scheduled based on theTimeinterval selected. For example, if you selectEvery 4 hours, then the backups are taken at approximately in the interval of every 4 hours so the backups are distributed equally across the day. If a once a day backup is sufficient, then choose theDailybackup frequency. In the daily backup frequency, you can specify the time of the day when your backups are taken. It's important to note that the time of the day indicates the backup start time and not the time when the backup completes. The time required for completing the backup operation is dependent on various factors including size of the disk, and churn rate between consecutive backups. However, Azure Disk backup is an agentless backup that usesincremental snapshots, which doesn't impact the production application performance.

In theBackup policytab, select retention settings that meet the recovery point objective (RPO) requirement.The default retention rule applies if no other retention rule is specified. The default retention rule can be modified to change the retention duration, but it cannot be deleted. You can add a new retention rule by selectingAdd retention rule.You can pickfirst successful backuptaken daily or weekly, and provide the retention duration that the specific backups are to be retained before they're deleted. This option is useful to retain specific backups of the day or week for a longer duration of time. All other frequent backups can be retained for a shorter duration.NoteAzure Backup for Managed Disks uses incremental snapshots which are limited to 500 snapshots per disk. At a point in time you can have 500 snapshots for a disk. Thus, to prevent backup failure the retention duration is limited by the snapshot limit. To allow you to take on-demand backups aside from scheduled backups, backup policy limits the total backups to 450. Learn more aboutincremental snapshotsfor managed disk.You can either set a maximum retention limit of 1 year or 450 disk snapshots, whichever reaches first. For example, if you have opted for a backup frequency of 12 hours, then you can retain each recovery point for maximum 225 days as the snapshot limit will be breached beyond that.

For Azure Disks belonging to Standard HDD, Standard SSD, and Premium SSD SKUs, you can define the backup schedule withHourlyfrequency (of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 hours) andDailyfrequency.
For Azure Disks belonging to Premium V2 and Ultra Disk SKUs, you can define the backup schedule withHourlyfrequency of only 12 hours andDailyfrequency.
Configure backup
Azure Disk backup supports only the operational tier backup. Copying of backups to the vault storage tier is currently not supported. The Backup vault storage redundancy setting (LRS/GRS) doesnât apply to the backups stored in the operational tier.Incremental snapshots are stored in a Standard HDD storage, irrespective of the selected storage type of the parent disk. For additional reliability, incremental snapshots are stored onZone Redundant Storage (ZRS)by default in ZRS supported regions.

For additional reliability, incremental snapshots are stored onZone Redundant Storage (ZRS)by default in ZRS supported regions.
Azure Disk backup supports cross-subscription (backup vault in one subscription and the source disk in another) backup and restore. Currently, cross-region backup and restore aren't supported by Azure Disk backup, that is, the backup vault and disk to back up are in different regions.So, to use Azure Disk backup, ensure that the backup vault and disk to back up are in the same region.

Currently, Azure Disk Backup supports operational backup of managed disks that doesn't copy backups to the Backup vault storage.

Currently, Azure Disk Backup only supports backup of individual disks. Point-in-time backup of multiple disks attached to a virtual machine isn't supported.In the Azure portal, you can only select disks within the same subscription. If you have several disks to be backed up or if the disks reside in different subscriptions, you can use scripts (PowerShell/CLI) to automate.See thesupport matrixfor more information on the Azure Disk backup region availability, supported scenarios, and limitations.
