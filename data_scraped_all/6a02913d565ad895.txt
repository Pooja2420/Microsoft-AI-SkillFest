Azure Front Door can be used to deliver high-bandwidth content by caching blobs from Azure Storage. In this article, you create an Azure Storage account and enable Front Door to cache and accelerate content from Azure Storage.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Sign in to the Azure portal
Sign in to theAzure portalwith your Azure account.
Create a storage account
A storage account provides access to Azure Storage services. It represents the highest level of the namespace for accessing each Azure Storage service component: Azure Blob, Queue, and Table storage. For more information, seeIntroduction to Microsoft Azure Storage.
In the Azure portal, select+ Create a resourcein the upper left corner. TheCreate a resourcepane appears.

On theCreate a resourcepage, search forStorage accountand selectStorage accountfrom the list. Then selectCreate.

On theCreate a storage accountpage, enter or select the following information for the new storage account:SettingValueResource groupSelectCreate newand enter the nameAFDResourceGroup. You can also select an existing resource group.Storage account nameEnter a name for the account using 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers only. The name must be unique across Azure and becomes the host name in the URL used to address blob, queue, or table resources for the subscription. To address a container resource in Blob storage, use a URI in the following format: http://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>.RegionSelect an Azure region closest to you from the drop-down list.Leave all other settings as default. Select theReviewtab, selectCreate, and then selectReview + Create.
On theCreate a storage accountpage, enter or select the following information for the new storage account:

The creation of the storage account can take a few minutes to complete. Once creation is complete, selectGo to resourceto go to the new storage account resource.

Enable Azure Front Door CDN for the storage account

In theNew endpointsection, enter the following information:SettingValueService typeSelectAzure Front Door.Create new/use existing profileChoose to create a new Front Door profile or select an existing one.Profile nameEnter a name for the Front Door profile. If you selectedUse existing, choose from the available profiles.Endpoint nameEnter your endpoint hostname, such ascontoso1234. This name is used to access your cached resources at the URL<endpoint-name + hash value>.z01.azurefd.net.Origin hostnameBy default, a new Front Door endpoint uses the hostname of your storage account as the origin server.Pricing tierSelectStandardfor content delivery orPremiumfor content delivery with security features.CachingOptional- Toggle on toenable cachingfor your static content. Choose an appropriate query string behavior and enable compression if needed.WAFOptional- Toggle on to protect your endpoint from vulnerabilities, malicious actors, and bots withWeb Application Firewall. Use an existing policy from the WAF policy dropdown or create a new one.Private linkOptional- Toggle on to keep your storage account private, not exposed to the public internet. Select the region that matches your storage account or is closest to your origin. Chooseblobas the target subresource.NoteWith the Standard tier, you can only use custom rules with WAF. To deploy managed rules and bot protection, choose the Premium tier. For a detailed comparison, seeAzure Front Door tier comparison.The Private Link feature isonlyavailable with the Premium tier.

Note
The endpoint list will only show Front Door and CDN profiles within the same subscription.
Extra features
From the storage accountFront Door and CDNpage, select the endpoint from the list to open the Front Door endpoint configuration page. Here, you can enable other Azure Front Door features such as therules engineand configure trafficload balancing.
For best practices, refer toUse Azure Front Door with Azure Storage blobs.
Enable SAS
To grant limited access to private storage containers, use the Shared Access Signature (SAS) feature of your Azure Storage account. A SAS is a URI that grants restricted access rights to your Azure Storage resources without exposing your account key.
Access CDN content
To access cached content with Azure Front Door, use the Front Door URL provided in the portal. The address for a cached blob follows this format:
http://<endpoint-name-with-hash-value>.z01.azurefd.net/<myPublicContainer>/<BlobName>
Note
After enabling Azure Front Door access to a storage account, all publicly available objects are eligible for Front Door POP (Point-of-presence) caching. If you modify an object that is currently cached in Front Door, the new content won't be available until Front Door refreshes its content after the time-to-live period expires.
Add a custom domain
Using a custom domain with Azure Front Door allows your own domain name to be visible in end-user requests, which can enhance customer convenience and support branding efforts.
To add a custom domain:
Navigate to the storage accountFront Door and CDN* page.
Navigate to the storage accountFront Door and CDN* page.
SelectView custom domainsfor the Azure Front Door endpoint.
SelectView custom domainsfor the Azure Front Door endpoint.
On the domains page, add a new custom domain to access your storage account.
On the domains page, add a new custom domain to access your storage account.
For detailed instructions, seeConfigure a custom domain with Azure Front Door.
Purge cached content from Azure Front Door
If you no longer want to cache an object in Azure Front Door, you can purge the cached content.
Navigate to the storage accountFront Door and CDNpage.
Navigate to the storage accountFront Door and CDNpage.
Select the Azure Front Door endpoint from the list to open the Azure Front Door endpoint configuration page.
Select the Azure Front Door endpoint from the list to open the Azure Front Door endpoint configuration page.

Select the endpoint, domain, and path you want to purge.
Select the endpoint, domain, and path you want to purge.
Note
An object already cached in Azure Front Door will remain cached until the time-to-live period expires or until you purge the endpoint.
Clean up resources
In the preceding steps, you created an Azure Front Door profile and an endpoint in a resource group. If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them to avoid incurring charges.
In the Azure portal, selectResource groupsfrom the left-hand menu, then selectAFDResourceGroup.

On theResource grouppage, selectDelete resource group. EnterAFDResourceGroupin the text box, then selectDelete. This action deletes the resource group, profile, and endpoint created in this guide.
On theResource grouppage, selectDelete resource group. EnterAFDResourceGroupin the text box, then selectDelete. This action deletes the resource group, profile, and endpoint created in this guide.
To delete your storage account, select the storage account from the dashboard, then selectDeletefrom the top menu.
