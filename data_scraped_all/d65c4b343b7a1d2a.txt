Registration
Resource providers marked with- registered by defaultin the previous section are automatically registered for your subscription. For other resource providers, you need toregister them. However, many resource providers are registered automatically when you perform specific actions. For example, when you create resources through the portal or by deploying anAzure Resource Manager template, Azure Resource Manager automatically registers any required unregistered resource providers.
Important
Register a resource provider only when you're ready to use it. This registration step helps maintain least privileges within your subscription. A malicious user can't use unregistered resource providers.
Registering unnecessary resource providers may result in unrecognized apps appearing in your Microsoft Entra tenant. Microsoft adds the app for a resource provider when you register it. These apps are typically added by the Windows Azure Service Management API. To prevent unnecessary apps in your tenant, only register needed resource providers.
Find resource provider
To identify resource providers used for your existing Azure infrastructure, list the deployed resources. Specify the resource group containing the resources.
The following example uses Azure CLI:
az resource list --resource-group examplegroup
az resource list --resource-group examplegroup
The results include the resource type. The resource provider namespace is the first part of the resource type. The following example shows theMicrosoft.KeyVaultresource provider.
[
  {
    ...
    "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults"
  }
]
[
  {
    ...
    "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults"
  }
]
The following example uses PowerShell:
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName examplegroup
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName examplegroup
The results include the resource type. The resource provider namespace is the first part of the resource type. The following example shows theMicrosoft.KeyVaultresource provider.
Name              : examplekey
ResourceGroupName : examplegroup
ResourceType      : Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults
...
Name              : examplekey
ResourceGroupName : examplegroup
ResourceType      : Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults
...
The following example uses Python:
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

subscription_id = os.environ["AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"]
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

resource_group_name = "examplegroup"
resources = resource_client.resources.list_by_resource_group(resource_group_name)

for resource in resources:
    print(resource.type)
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

subscription_id = os.environ["AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"]
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

resource_group_name = "examplegroup"
resources = resource_client.resources.list_by_resource_group(resource_group_name)

for resource in resources:
    print(resource.type)
The results list the resource type. The resource provider namespace is the first part of the resource type. The following example shows theMicrosoft.KeyVaultresource provider.
Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults
Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults
