Minimal ingestion profile for control plane Metrics in Managed Prometheus
Azure Monitor metrics addon collects many Prometheus metrics by default.Minimal ingestion profileis a setting that helps reduce ingestion volume of metrics, as only metrics used by default dashboards, default recording rules and default alerts are collected. This section describes how this setting is configured specifically for control plane metrics. This section also lists metrics collected by default whenminimal ingestion profileis enabled.
Minimal ingestion profile
minimal ingestion profile
Note
For addon based collection,Minimal ingestion profilesetting is enabled by default. The discussion here is focused on control plane metrics. The current set of default targets and metrics is listedhere.
Minimal ingestion profile
Following targets areenabled/ONby default - meaning you don't have to provide any scrape job configuration for scraping these targets, as metrics addon scrapes these targets automatically by default:
controlplane-apiserver(job=controlplane-apiserver)
controlplane-apiserver
controlplane-apiserver
controlplane-etcd(job=controlplane-etcd)
controlplane-etcd
controlplane-etcd
Following targets are available to scrape, but scraping isn't enabled (disabled/OFF) by default. Meaning you don't have to provide any scrape job configuration for scraping these targets, and you need to turnON/enablescraping for these targets using theama-metrics-settings-configmapunder thedefault-scrape-settings-enabledsection.

The default scrape frequency for all default targets and scrapes is30 seconds. You can override it for each target using theama-metrics-settings-configmapunderdefault-targets-scrape-interval-settingssection.

These are high cardinality metrics which may increase the number of metrics stored based on the number of custom resources in the cluster. If you would like to collect these bucket metrics, you can add it to the keep list. We highly recommend not turning off the minimal ingestion profile for the control plane components

kube-apiserver
Contains diagnostic logs for the Kubernetes API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, Cluster Autoscaler, Cloud Controller Manager, Guard, and the Azure CSI storage drivers. These diagnostic logs have distinct Category entries corresponding their diagnostic log setting (e.g. kube-apiserver, kube-audit-admin). Requires Diagnostic Settings to use the Resource Specific destination table.
kube-audit
Contains all Kubernetes API Server audit logs including events with the get and list verbs. These events are useful for monitoring all of the interactions with the Kubernetes API. To limit the scope to modifying operations see the ArcK8sAuditAdmin table. Requires Diagnostic Settings to use the Resource Specific destination table.
kube-audit-admin
Contains Kubernetes API Server audit logs excluding events with the get and list verbs. These events are useful for monitoring resource modification requests made to the Kubernetes API. To see all modifying and non-modifying operations see the ArcK8sAudit table. Requires Diagnostic Settings to use the Resource Specific destination table.

Microsoft.ContainerService resource provider operations
The following table lists a few example operations related to AKS that might be created in the Activity log. Use the Activity log to track information such as when a cluster is created or had its configuration change. You can view this information in the portal or by usingother methods. You can also use it to create an Activity log alert to be proactively notified when an event occurs.
