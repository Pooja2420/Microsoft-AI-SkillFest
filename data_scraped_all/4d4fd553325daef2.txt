1. Create a Microsoft Entra OIDC App
On thePermissions Management Onboarding - Microsoft Entra OIDC App Creationpage, enter theOIDC Azure app name.This app is used to set up an OpenID Connect (OIDC) connection to your AWS account. OIDC is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications. The scripts generated on this page create the app of this specified name in your Microsoft Entra tenant with the right configuration.

5. Set up an AWS member account
SelectEnable AWS SSO checkbox, if the AWS account access is configured through AWS SSO.
Choose from three options to manage AWS accounts.
Choose this option to automatically detect and add to the monitored account list, without extra configuration. Steps to detect list of accounts and onboard for collection:
Deploy Management account CFT (Cloudformation template) which creates organization account role that grants permission to OIDC role created earlier to list accounts, OUs and SCPs.
If AWS SSO is enabled, organization account CFT also adds policy needed to collect AWS SSO configuration details.
Deploy Member account CFT in all the accounts that need to be monitored by Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. These actions create a cross account role that trusts the OIDC role created earlier. The SecurityAudit policy is attached to the role created for data collection.
Any current or future accounts found get onboarded automatically.
To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration:
Go toData Collectorstab.
Click on the status of the data collector.
