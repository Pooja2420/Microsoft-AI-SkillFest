This article describes how to tag a VM in Azure using a Resource Manager template. Tags are user-defined key/value pairs which can be placed directly on a resource or a resource group. Azure currently supports up to 50 tags per resource and resource group. Tags may be placed on a resource at the time of creation or added to an existing resource.
This templateplaces tags on the following resources: Compute (Virtual Machine), Storage (Storage Account), and Network (Public IP Address, Virtual Network, and Network Interface). This template is for a Windows VM but can be adapted for Linux VMs.
Click theDeploy to Azurebutton from thetemplate link. This will navigate to theAzure portalwhere you can deploy this template.

This template includes the following tags:Department,Application, andCreated By. You can add/edit these tags directly in the template if you would like different tag names.

As you can see, the tags are defined as key/value pairs, separated by a colon (:). The tags must be defined in this format:
"tags": {
    "Key1" : "Value1",
    "Key2" : "Value2"
}
"tags": {
    "Key1" : "Value1",
    "Key2" : "Value2"
}
Save the template file after you finish editing it with the tags of your choice.
Next, in theEdit Parameterssection, you can fill out the values for your tags.

ClickCreateto deploy this template with your tag values.
