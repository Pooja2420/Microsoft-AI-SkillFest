This article describes how to investigate API security findings, alerts, and security posture recommendations for APIs protected byMicrosoft Defender for APIs.
Before you start
Onboard your API resourcesto Defender for APIs.
To explore security risks within your organization using Cloud Security Explorer, the Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) plan must be enabled.Learn more.
View recommendations and runtime alerts
In the Defender for Cloud portal, selectWorkload protections.

Remediate recommendations using Workflow Automation
You can remediate recommendations generated by Defender for APIs using workflow automations.
In an eligible recommendation, select one or more unhealthy resources.
SelectTrigger logic app.
Confirm theSelected subscription.
Select a relevant logic app from the list.
SelectTrigger.
You can browse theMicrosoft Defender for Cloud GitHubrepository for available workflow automation.
Create sample security alerts
In Defender for Cloud you can use sample alerts to evaluate your Defender for Cloud plans, and validate your security configuration.Follow these instructionsto set up sample alerts, and select the relevant APIs within your subscriptions.
Simulate alerts
To see the alert process in action, you can simulate an action that triggers a Defender for APIs alert.Follow the instructions in our Tech Community blogto do that.
Build queries in Cloud Security Explorer
In Defender CSPM,Cloud Security Graphcollects data to provide a map of assets and connections across organization, to expose security risks, vulnerabilities, and possible lateral movement paths.
When the Defender CSPM plan is enabled together with Defender for APIs, you can use Cloud Security Explorer to identify, review and analyze API security risks across your organization.
In the Defender for Cloud portal, selectCloud Security Explorer.
InWhat would you like to search?select theAPIscategory.
Review the search results so that you can review, prioritize, and fix any API issues.
Alternatively, you can select one of the templated API queries to see high risk issues likeInternet exposed API endpoints with sensitive dataorAPIs communicating over unencrypted protocols with unauthenticated API endpoints
