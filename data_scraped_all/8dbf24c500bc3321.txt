Configure ExpressRoute and site-to-site coexisting connections using PowerShell

PowerShell - Resource Manager
PowerShell - Classic
This article helps you configure ExpressRoute and site-to-site VPN connections that coexist. Configuring both connections has several advantages:
You can set up a site-to-site VPN as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute.
Alternatively, you can use site-to-site VPNs to connect to sites that aren't connected through ExpressRoute.
The steps to configure both scenarios are covered in this article. This article applies to the Resource Manager deployment model and uses PowerShell. You can also configure these scenarios using the Azure portal, although documentation isn't yet available. You can configure either gateway first. Typically, you don't experience any downtime when adding a new gateway or gateway connection.
Note
If you want to create a site-to-site VPN over an ExpressRoute circuit, seesite-to-site VPN over Microsoft peering.
Limits and limitations
Only route-based VPN gateway is supported.You must use a route-basedVPN gateway. You can also use a route-based VPN gateway with a VPN connection configured for 'policy-based traffic selectors' as described inConnect to multiple policy-based VPN devices.
ExpressRoute-VPN Gateway coexist configurations arenot supported with Basic SKU VPN Gateway.
If you want to use transit routing between ExpressRoute and VPN,the ASN of Azure VPN Gateway must be set to 65515, and Azure Route Server should be used.Azure VPN Gateway supports the BGP routing protocol. For ExpressRoute and Azure VPN to work together, you must keep the Autonomous System Number of your Azure VPN gateway at its default value, 65515. If you previously selected an ASN other than 65515 and you change the setting to 65515, you must reset the VPN gateway for the setting to take effect.
The gateway subnet must be /27 or a shorter prefix, such as /26 or /25, or you receive an error message when you add the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.
Configuration designs
Configure a site-to-site VPN as a failover path for ExpressRoute
You can configure a site-to-site VPN connection as a backup for your ExpressRoute connection. This setup applies only to virtual networks linked to the Azure private peering path. There's no VPN-based failover solution for services accessible through Azure Microsoft peering. The ExpressRoute circuit is always the primary link, and data flows through the site-to-site VPN path only if the ExpressRoute circuit fails. To avoid asymmetrical routing, configure your local network to prefer the ExpressRoute circuit over the site-to-site VPN by setting a higher local preference for the routes received via ExpressRoute.
Note
If you have ExpressRoute Microsoft peering enabled, you can receive the public IP address of your Azure VPN gateway on the ExpressRoute connection. To set up your site-to-site VPN connection as a backup, configure your on-premises network so that the VPN connection is routed to the Internet.
While the ExpressRoute circuit path is preferred over the site-to-site VPN when both routes are the same, Azure uses the longest prefix match to choose the route towards the packet's destination.

Configure a site-to-site VPN to connect to sites not connected through ExpressRoute
You can configure your network so that some sites connect directly to Azure over a site-to-site VPN, while others connect through ExpressRoute.

Selecting the steps to use
There are two different sets of procedures to choose from. The configuration procedure you select depends on whether you have an existing virtual network or need to create a new one.
I don't have a virtual network and need to create one.If you donât already have a virtual network, this procedure walks you through creating a new virtual network using the Resource Manager deployment model and creating new ExpressRoute and site-to-site VPN connections.

If you donât already have a virtual network, this procedure walks you through creating a new virtual network using the Resource Manager deployment model and creating new ExpressRoute and site-to-site VPN connections.
I already have a Resource Manager deployment model virtual network.If you already have a virtual network with an existing site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute connection, and the gateway subnet prefix is /28 or longer (/29, /30, etc.), you need to delete the existing gateway. The steps to configure coexisting connections for an existing virtual network section guide you through deleting the gateway and then creating new ExpressRoute and site-to-site VPN connections.Deleting and recreating your gateway causes downtime for your cross-premises connections. However, your VMs and services can connect through the internet while you configure your gateway if they're set up to do so.

Before you begin
The steps and examples in this article use Azure PowerShell Az modules. To install the Az modules locally on your computer, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn more about the new Az module, seeIntroducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module. PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. If you are not running the latest version, the values specified in the instructions may fail. To find the installed versions of PowerShell on your system, use theGet-Module -ListAvailable Azcmdlet.

You can use Azure Cloud Shell to run most PowerShell cmdlets and CLI commands, instead of installing Azure PowerShell or CLI locally. Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that has common Azure tools preinstalled and is configured to use with your account. To run any code contained in this article on Azure Cloud Shell, open a Cloud Shell session, use theCopybutton on a code block to copy the code, and paste it into the Cloud Shell session withCtrl+Shift+Von Windows and Linux, orCmd+Shift+Von macOS. Pasted text is not automatically executed, pressEnterto run code.
There are a few ways to launch the Cloud Shell:
