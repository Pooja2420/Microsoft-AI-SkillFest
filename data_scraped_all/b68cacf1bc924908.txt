Creating configuration content for the first time can be challenging. In many cases, the goal is to
automate configuration of servers following a "baseline" that hopefully aligns to an industry
recommendation.
Note
This article refers to a solution that's maintained by the Open Source community. Support is only
available in the form of GitHub collaboration, not from Microsoft.
Community project: PowerSTIG
A community project namedPowerSTIGaims to resolve this issue by generating DSC content based
onpublic informationprovided about STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide),
Dealing with baselines is more complicated than it sounds. Many organizations need todocument exceptionsto rules and manage that data at scale. PowerSTIG addresses the problem by
providingComposite Resourcesto address each area of the configuration rather than trying to
address the entire range of settings in one large file.
After you create the configurations, you can use theDSC Configuration scriptsto generate MOF
files andupload the MOF files to Azure Automation. To pull configurations, register your
servers from eitheron-premisesorin Azure.
To try out PowerSTIG, visit thePowerShell Galleryand download the solution or selectProject Siteto view thedocumentation.
