APPLIES TO:Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server
This article describes how you can enable or disable high availability configuration in your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server in same zone, or zone redundant deployment models.
High availability feature deploys physically separate primary and standby replicas. Both replicas can be provisioned within the same availability zone or each on a different zone, depending on the deployment model you choose. For more information, seehigh availability concepts. You can enable high availability at creation time of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, or you can do it after the server is created.
Important
Billing Model Update for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (v5 HA):In April, we implemented a billing model update for v5 SKU with High Availability (HA) enabled servers. This change aims to correctly reflect the charges, by accounting for both the primary and standby servers. Before this change, we were incorrectly charging customers for the primary server only. Customers using v5 SKU with HA enabled servers would now see billing quantities multiplied by 2. This update doesn't impact v4 and v3 SKUs.

You can enable high availability in an existing server via theaz postgres flexible-server updatecommand.
To enable high availability so that standby server is deployed in the same zone as the primary server, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server update \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability SameZone
az postgres flexible-server update \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability SameZone
To enable high availability with standby server deployed in a different zone than the primary server, and if you want the zone to be automatically selected, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server update \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant
az postgres flexible-server update \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant
Also, optionally, you can select the availability zone in which the standby server should be deployed. To do so, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server update \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant \
  --standby-zone <standby_zone>
az postgres flexible-server update \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant \
  --standby-zone <standby_zone>
If you're enabling high availability with zone redundancy, and the zone specified for standby matches the zone of the primary, you get this error:
Your server is in availability zone <server>. The zone of the server cannot be same as the standby zone.
Your server is in availability zone <server>. The zone of the server cannot be same as the standby zone.
If you're enabling high availability with zone redundancy, and the zone specified for standby isn't available in that region, you get this error:

You can enable high availability while provisioning a new server via theaz postgres flexible-server createcommand.
Note
The following commands need to be completed with other parameters, whose presence and values would vary depending on how you want to configure other features of the provisioned server.
To deploy the primary server with a standby server in the same zone, and let the service choose for you the zone, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability SameZone ...
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability SameZone ...
To deploy the primary server with a standby server in the same zone, and explicitly choose the zone, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability SameZone \
  --zone <zone> ...
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability SameZone \
  --zone <zone> ...
If the availability zone specified isn't supported in the selected region, you get this error:
Code: AvailabilityZoneNotAvailable
Message: Specified availability zone is not supported in this region. Please choose a different availability zone.
Code: AvailabilityZoneNotAvailable
Message: Specified availability zone is not supported in this region. Please choose a different availability zone.
To deploy the primary server with a standby server in a different zone, and let the service choose for you both zones, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant ...
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant ...
To deploy the primary server with a standby server in a different zone, explicitly specify the zone for the primary but let the service choose the zone for the standby, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant \
  --zone <zone> ...
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant \
  --zone <zone> ...
To deploy the primary server with a standby server in a different zone, and explicitly specify the zone for the primary and the standby, use this command:
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant \
  --zone <zone> \
  --standby-zone <standby_zone>...
az postgres flexible-server create \
  --resource-group <resource_group> \
  --name <server> \
  --high-availability ZoneRedundant \
  --zone <zone> \
  --standby-zone <standby_zone>...
If you choose zone redundant high availability, and the same value is specified for the zones of the primary and standby servers, you get this error:
Your server is in availability zone <zone>. The zone of the server cannot be same as the standby zone.
Your server is in availability zone <zone>. The zone of the server cannot be same as the standby zone.
If the high availability mode selected is zone redundant, and the region doesn't have multiple availability zones, you get this error:
This region is single availability zone. Zone redundant high availability is not supported in a single availability zone region.
This region is single availability zone. Zone redundant high availability is not supported in a single availability zone region.
Steps to initiate a forced failover
Follow these steps to force a failover of your primary server to the standby server in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. Initiating a forced failover immediately brings the primary server down, and triggers a failover to the standby server. Initiating a forced failover is useful for cases in which you want to test how a failover caused by an unplanned outage would affect your workload.
Important
Don't perform immediate, back-to-back failovers. Wait for at least 15-20 minutes between failovers. Such wait allows the new standby server to be fully established.

Message: Operation HandleWalServiceFailureManagementOperation failed, because server <server> not in active state.
Steps to initiate a planned failover
Follow these steps to perform a planned failover from your primary server to the standby server in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. Initiating this operation first prepares the standby server, and then performs the failover. This failover operation provides the least downtime, as it performs a graceful failover to the standby server. It's useful for situations like after an unexpected failover occurs, and you want to bring the primary server back to your preferred availability zone.
Important
Don't perform immediate, back-to-back failovers. Wait for at least 15-20 minutes between failovers. Such wait allows the new standby server to be fully established.

If you deploy a server in a region that consists of a single availability zone, you can enable high availability in same zone mode only. If the region is enhanced in the future with multiple availability zones, you can deploy new Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server with high availability configured as same zone or zone redundant. However, for any instances that were deployed in the region when the region consisted of a single availability zone, you can't directly enable high availability in zone redundant mode for them. As a workaround, you can restore those instances onto new instances, and then enable zone redundant high availability on the restored servers.Follow the instructions provided inRestore to latest restore point, to restore the existing instance on a new one, using the latest restore point.Once the new server is created,enable high availability with zone redundancy.After data verification, you can optionallydeletethe old server.Make sure that the connection strings of your clients are modified to point to your newly restored instance.
