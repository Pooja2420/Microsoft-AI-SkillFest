This article shows you how to create or edit an activity log, service health, or resource health alert rule in Azure Monitor. To learn more about alerts, see thealerts overview.
You create an alert rule by combining the resources to be monitored, the monitoring data from the resource, and the conditions that you want to trigger the alert. You can then defineaction groupsandalert processing rulesto determine what happens when an alert is triggered.
Alerts triggered by these alert rules contain a payload that uses thecommon alert schema.
Prerequisites
To create or edit an alert rule, you must have the following permissions:
Read permission on the target resource of the alert rule.
Write permission on the resource group in which the alert rule is created. If you're creating the alert rule from the Azure portal, the alert rule is created by default in the same resource group in which the target resource resides.
Read permission on any action group associated to the alert rule, if applicable.
Access the alert rule wizard in the Azure portal
There are multiple ways to create or edit an alert rule.
Create or edit an alert rule from the portal home page
In theAzure portal, selectMonitor.
On the left pane, selectAlerts.
Select+ Create>Alert rule.

Create or edit an alert rule from a specific resource
In theAzure portal, go to the resource.
On the left pane, selectAlerts.
Select+ Create>Alert rule.
The scope of the alert rule is set to the resource you selected. Continue with setting the conditions for the alert rule.

Edit an existing alert rule
In theAzure portal, either from the home page or from a specific resource, selectAlertson the left pane.

Configure alert rule actions
On theActionstab, you can optionally select or createaction groupsfor your alert rule.

Configure alert rule details
On theDetailstab, enter values forAlert rule nameandAlert rule description.

(Optional) ForRegion, select a region in which your alert rule will be processed. If you need to make sure the rule is processed within theEU Data Boundary, select the North Europe or West Europe region. In all other cases, you can select the Global region (which is the default).NoteService Health alert rules can only be located in the Global region.

Note
Service Health alert rules can only be located in the Global region.

(Optional) In theCustom propertiessection, if this alert rule contains action groups, you can add your own properties to include in the alert notification payload. You can use these properties in the actions that the action group calls, such as by a webhook, Azure function, or logic app action.The custom properties are specified as key/value pairs by using static text, a dynamic value extracted from the alert payload, or a combination of both.The format for extracting a dynamic value from the alert payload is:${<path to schema field>}. For example:${data.essentials.monitorCondition}.Use the format of thecommon alert schemato specify the field in the payload, whether or not the action groups configured for the alert rule use the common schema.NoteCustom properties are added to the payload of the alert, but they don't appear in the email template or in the alert details in the Azure portal.The following examples use values inCustom propertiesto utilize data from a payload that uses the common alert schema.This example creates anAdditional Detailstag with data regarding the window start time and window end time:Name:Additional DetailsValue:Evaluation windowStartTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowStartTime}. windowEndTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowEndTime}Result:AdditionalDetails:Evaluation windowStartTime: 2023-04-04T14:39:24.492Z. windowEndTime: 2023-04-04T14:44:24.492ZThis example adds data regarding the reason for resolving or firing the alert:Name:Alert ${data.essentials.monitorCondition} reasonValue:${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricName} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].operator} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].threshold} ${data.essentials.monitorCondition}.

Note
Custom properties are added to the payload of the alert, but they don't appear in the email template or in the alert details in the Azure portal.

The following examples use values inCustom propertiesto utilize data from a payload that uses the common alert schema.
This example creates anAdditional Detailstag with data regarding the window start time and window end time:
Name:Additional Details
Additional Details
Value:Evaluation windowStartTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowStartTime}. windowEndTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowEndTime}
Evaluation windowStartTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowStartTime}. windowEndTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowEndTime}
Result:AdditionalDetails:Evaluation windowStartTime: 2023-04-04T14:39:24.492Z. windowEndTime: 2023-04-04T14:44:24.492Z
AdditionalDetails:Evaluation windowStartTime: 2023-04-04T14:39:24.492Z. windowEndTime: 2023-04-04T14:44:24.492Z
This example adds data regarding the reason for resolving or firing the alert:
Name:Alert ${data.essentials.monitorCondition} reason
Alert ${data.essentials.monitorCondition} reason
Value:${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricName} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].operator} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].threshold} ${data.essentials.monitorCondition}. The value is ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricValue}
${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricName} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].operator} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].threshold} ${data.essentials.monitorCondition}. The value is ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricValue}
Potential results:Alert Resolved reason: Percentage CPU GreaterThan5 Resolved. The value is 3.585Alert Fired reason": "Percentage CPU GreaterThan5 Fired. The value is 10.585
Alert Resolved reason: Percentage CPU GreaterThan5 Resolved. The value is 3.585
Alert Resolved reason: Percentage CPU GreaterThan5 Resolved. The value is 3.585
Alert Fired reason": "Percentage CPU GreaterThan5 Fired. The value is 10.585
Alert Fired reason": "Percentage CPU GreaterThan5 Fired. The value is 10.585
Configure alert rule tags
On theTagstab, you can optionally set any required tags on the alert rule resource.

Review and create the alert rule
On theReview + createtab, the rule is validated. If there's a problem, go back and fix it.
