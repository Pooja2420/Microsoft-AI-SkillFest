Custom rules allow you to create tailored rules to suit the exact needs of your applications and security policies. Now, you can restrict access to your web applications by country/region. As with all custom rules, this logic can be compounded with other rules to suit the needs of your application.
To create a geo-filtering custom rule in the Azure portal, selectGeo locationas the Match Type, and then select the country/region or countries/regions you want to allow/block from your application. When creating geomatch rules with Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager, use the match variableRemoteAddrand the operatorGeomatch. For more information, seehow to create custom rules in PowerShelland morecustom rule examples.
RemoteAddr
Geomatch
Note
Geo-filtering works based on mapping each request's IP address to a country or region. There might be some IP addresses in the data set that are not yet mapped to a country or region. To avoid accidentally blocking legitimate users, Application Gateway's WAF allows requests from unknown IP addresses.
Important
Include the country codeZZwhenever you use geo-filtering. TheZZcountry code (orUnknowncountry/region) captures IP addresses that are not yet mapped to a country or region in our dataset. This avoids false positives.
Country/Region codes
If you're using the Geomatch operator, the selectors can be any of the following two-digit country/region codes.
