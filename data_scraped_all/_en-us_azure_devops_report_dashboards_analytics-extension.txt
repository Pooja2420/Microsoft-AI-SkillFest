What happens if I pause or disable Analytics?
When you pause or disable the Analytics extension (2019), the following features get disabled:
Analytics widgets
Analytics in-context reports, such as pipeline and test reports
Power BI integration using Analytics views
OData endpoint queries
Pausing Analytics preserves your data but stops staging jobs from updating your data. You can resume the service later and then your data updates.
When you disable or remove the Analytics extension (2019), it turns off all Analytics staging jobs and deletes the Analytics data that is stored in the Analytics tables. All Analytics data that captures historical trends is lost. It doesn't delete any other data stored in your collection. You can't undo this action. Once historical data and trending data is deleted, you can't restore it. Re-enabling Analytics doesn't restore the historical data.
With Analytics disabled or removed, the following actions occur:
No staging jobs run, and the Analytics tables information doesn't get updated.
Table data is deleted, and if Analytics is re-enabled, all data must get repopulated from scratch.
For more information about the data tables, seeAnalytics data model.
