Users can sign into Azure Virtual Desktop from anywhere using different devices and clients. However, there are certain measures you should take to help keep your environment and your users safe. Using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) with Azure Virtual Desktop prompts users during the sign-in process for another form of identification in addition to their username and password. You can enforce MFA for Azure Virtual Desktop using Conditional Access, and can also configure whether it applies to the web client, mobile apps, desktop clients, or all clients.
When a user connects to a remote session, they need to authenticate to the Azure Virtual Desktop service and the session host. If MFA is enabled, it's used when connecting to the Azure Virtual Desktop service and the user is prompted for their user account and a second form of authentication, in the same way as accessing other services. When a user starts a remote session, a username and password is required for the session host, but this is seamless to the user if single sign-on (SSO) is enabled. For more information, seeAuthentication methods.
How often a user is prompted to reauthenticate depends onMicrosoft Entra Conditional Access adaptive session lifetime policies. While remembering credentials is convenient, it can also make deployments using personal devices less secure. To protect your users, you can make sure the client asks for Microsoft Entra multi-factor authentication credentials more frequently. You can use Conditional Access sign-in frequency to configure this behavior.
Learn how to enforce MFA for Azure Virtual Desktop and optionally configure sign-in frequency in the following sections.
Prerequisites
Here's what you need to get started:
Assign users a license that includesMicrosoft Entra ID P1 or P2.
AMicrosoft Entra groupwith your Azure Virtual Desktop users assigned as group members.
Enable Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.
Create a Conditional Access policy
Here's how to create a Conditional Access policy that requires multifactor authentication when connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop:
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aConditional Access Administrator.

Note
When you use the web client to sign in to Azure Virtual Desktop through your browser, the log will list the client app ID as a85cf173-4192-42f8-81fa-777a763e6e2c (Azure Virtual Desktop client). This is because the client app is internally linked to the server app ID where the conditional access policy was set.
Tip
Some users may see a prompt titledStay signed in to all your appsif the Windows device they're using is not already registered with Microsoft Entra ID. If they deselectAllow my organization to manage my deviceand selectNo, sign in to this app only, they may be prompted for authentication more frequently.
Configure sign-in frequency
Sign-in frequency policieslet you configure how often users are required to sign-in when accessing Microsoft Entra-based resources. This can help secure your environment and is especially important for personal devices, where the local OS may not require MFA or may not lock automatically after inactivity. Users are prompted to authenticate only when a new access token is requested from Microsoft Entra ID when accessing a resource.
Sign-in frequency policies result in different behavior based on the Microsoft Entra app selected:
To configure the time period after which a user is asked to sign-in again:
Open the policy you created previously.
UnderAccess controls>Session, select0 controls selected.
In theSessionpane, selectSign-in frequency.
SelectPeriodic reauthenticationorEvery time.If you selectPeriodic reauthentication, set the value for the time period after which a user is asked to sign-in again when performing an action that requires a new access token, and then selectSelect. For example, setting the value to1and the unit toHours, requires multifactor authentication if a connection is launched more than an hour after the last user authentication.TheEvery timeoption is only supported when applied to theMicrosoft Remote DesktopandWindows Cloud Loginapps when single sign-on is enabled for your host pool. If you selectEvery time, users are prompted to reauthenticate when launching a new connection after a period of 5 to 10 minutes since their last authentication.

Note
Reauthentication only happens when a user must authenticate to a resource and a new access token is needed. After a connection is established, users aren't prompted even if the connection lasts longer than the sign-in frequency you've configured.
Users must reauthenticate if there is a network disruption that forces the session to be re-established after the sign-in frequency you've configured. This can lead to more frequent authentication requests on unstable networks.

Microsoft Entra joined session host VMs
For connections to succeed, you mustdisable the legacy per-user multifactor authentication sign-in method. If you don't want to restrict signing in to strong authentication methods like Windows Hello for Business, you need toexclude the Azure Windows VM Sign-In appfrom your Conditional Access policy.
