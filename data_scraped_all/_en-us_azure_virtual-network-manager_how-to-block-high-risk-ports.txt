In this article, you learn to block high risk network ports usingAzure Virtual Network Managerand Security Admin Rules. You walk through the creation of an Azure Virtual Network Manager instance, group your virtual networks (VNets) withnetwork groups, and create & deploy security admin configurations for your organization. You deploy a general block rule for high risk ports. Then you create an exception rule for managing a specific application's VNet using network security groups.
While this article focuses on a single port, SSH, you can protect any high-risk ports in your environment with the same steps. To learn more, review this list ofhigh risk ports
Prerequisites
You understand how to create anAzure Virtual Network Manager
You understand each element in aSecurity admin rule.
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
A group of virtual networks that can be split into network groups for applying granular security admin rules.
To modify dynamic network groups, you must begranted access via Azure RBAC roleassignment only. Classic Admin/legacy authorization is not supported
Deploy virtual network environment
You need a virtual network environment that includes virtual networks that can be segregated for allowing and blocking specific network traffic. You may use the following table or your own configuration of virtual networks:
Place all virtual networks in the same subscription, region, and resource group

Create a virtual network manager instance
In this section, you deploy a Virtual Network Manager instance with the Security admin feature in your organization.
Select+ Create a resourceand search forNetwork Manager. Then selectCreateto begin setting up Azure Virtual Network Manager.

Create a network group for all virtual networks
With your virtual network manager created, you now create a network group containing all of the VNets in the organization, and you manually add all of the VNets.
SelectNetwork Groups, underSettings.
Select+ Create, enter anamefor the network group, and selectAdd.
On theNetwork groupspage, select the network group you created.
SelectAdd, underStatic Membershipto manually add all the VNets.
On theAdd static memberspage, select all of the virtual networks you wish to include, and selectAdd.
Create a security admin configuration for all virtual networks
Itâs time to construct our security admin rules within a configuration in order to apply those rules to all the VNets within your network group at once. In this section, you create a security admin configuration. Then you create a rule collection and add rules for high risks ports like SSH or RDP. This configuration denies network traffic to all virtual networks in the network group.
Return to your virtual network manager resource.
SelectConfigurationsunderSettingsand then select+ Create.
SelectSecurity configurationfrom the drop-down menu.
On theBasicstab, enter aNameto identify this security configuration and selectNext: Rule collections.
Select+ Addfrom theAdd a security configuration page.
Enter aNameto identify this rule collection and then select theTarget network groupsyou want to apply the set of rules to. The target group is the network group containing all of your virtual networks.
Add a security rule for denying high-risk network traffic
In this section, you define the security rule to block high-risk network traffic to all virtual networks. When assigning priority, keep in mind future exception rules. Set the priority so that exception rules are applied over this rule.
Select+ AddunderSecurity admin rules.
Select+ AddunderSecurity admin rules.
Enter the information needed to define your security rule, then selectAddto add the rule to the rule collection.SettingValueNameEnter a rule name.DescriptionEnter a description about the rule.Priority*Enter a value between 1 and 4096 to determine the priority of the rule. The lower the value the higher the priority.Action*SelectDenyto block traffic.

Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a range using CIDR notation. When defining more than one address or blocks of addresses separate using a comma. Leave blank for this example.Source service tagThis field appears when you select the source type ofService tag. Select service tag(s) for services you want to specify as the source. SeeAvailable service tags, for the list of supported tags.Source portEnter a single port number or a port range such as (1024-65535). When defining more than one port or port ranges, separate them using a comma. To specify any port, enter *.

Enter the information needed to define your security rule, then selectAddto add the rule to the rule collection.
Repeat steps 1-3 again if you want to add more rules to the rule collection.

Deploy a security admin configuration for blocking network traffic
In this section, the rules created take effect when you deploy the security admin configuration.
SelectDeploymentsunderSettings, then selectDeploy configuration.
Select theInclude security admin in your goal statecheckbox and choose the security configuration you created in the last section from the dropdown menu. Then choose the region(s) you would like to deploy this configuration to.
SelectNextandDeployto deploy the security admin configuration.
Create a network group for traffic exception rule
With traffic blocked across all of your VNets, you need an exception to allow traffic to specific virtual networks. You create a network group specifically for the VNets needing exclusion from the other security admin rule.
From your virtual network manager, selectNetwork Groups, underSettings.
Select+ Create, enter anamefor the application network group, and selectAdd.
UnderDefine Dynamic Membership, selectDefine.
Enter or select the values to allow traffic to your application virtual network.
SelectPreview Resourcesto review theEffective Virtual Networksincluded, and selectClose.
SelectSave.
Create a traffic exception security admin rule and collection
In this section, you create a new rule collection and security admin rule that allows high-risk traffic to the subset of virtual networks you've defined as exceptions. Next, you add it to your existing security admin configuration.
Important
In order for your security admin rule to allow traffic to your application virtual networks, the priority needs to be set to alower numberthan existing rules blocking traffic.
For example, an all network rule blockingSSHhas a priority of10so your allow rule should have a priority from1 to 9.
From your virtual network manager, selectConfigurationsand select your security configuration.
SelectRule collectionsunderSettings, then select+ Createto create a new rule collection.
On theAdd a rule collection page, enter a name for your application rule collection and choose the application network group you created.
Under theSecurity admin rules, select + Add.
Enter or select the values to allow specific network traffic to your application network group, and selectaddwhen completed.
Repeat the add rule process for all traffic needing an exception.
SelectSavewhen you're done.
Redeploy the security admin configuration with exception rule
To apply the new rule collection, you redeploy your security admin configuration since it was modified by adding a rule collection.
From your virtual network manager, selectConfigurations.
Select your security admin configuration and selectDeploy
On theDeploy Configurationpage, select all target regions receiving the deployment and
SelectNextandDeploy.
