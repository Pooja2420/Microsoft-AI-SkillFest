Azure IoT Hub pricingprovides the general information on different SKUs and pricing for IoT Hub. This article contains details on how the various IoT Hub functionalities are metered as messages by IoT Hub.
Note
Some of the features mentioned in this article, like cloud-to-device messaging, device twins, and device management, are only available in the standard tier of IoT Hub. For more information about the basic and standard/free IoT Hub tiers, seeChoose the right IoT Hub tier and size for your solution.
Charges per operation
Use the following table to help determine which operations are charged. All billable operations are charged in 4K-byte blocks on basic and standard tier IoT hubs. Operations are metered in 0.5K-byte chunks on free tier IoT hubs. Details for each category are provided in theBilling informationcolumn. This column includes the following information:

One or more terms initalicsfollowing each operation (or endpoint). These terms represent billable operations that are charged against quota for your IoT hub. You may see these terms supplied as part of a quota usage insight when you initiate a support request on Azure portal. They may also be returned by customer support. You can use the table below to cross-reference these terms with the corresponding operation to help you understand quota usage and billing for your IoT solution. For more information, seeExample 4.
/devices/{id}/twin
/devices/{deviceid}/modules/{moduleid}/twin
/twin/PATCH/properties/reported/
/twin/PATCH/properties/desired/
/twins/{deviceId}/streams/{streamName}
/twins/{deviceId}/modules/{moduleId}/streams/{streamName}
Note
All sizes are computed considering the payload size in bytes (protocol framing is ignored). For messages, which have properties and body, the size is computed in a protocol-agnostic way. For more information, seeIoT Hub message format.
Maximum message sizes differ for different types of operations. To learn more, seeIoT Hub quotas and throttling.
For some operations, you can use batching and compression strategies to reduce costs. For an example using device-to-cloud telemetry, seeExample #3.
Example #1
A device sends one 1-KB device-to-cloud message per minute to IoT Hub, which is then read by Azure Stream Analytics. The solution back end invokes a method (with a 512-byte payload) on the device every 10 minutes to trigger a specific action. The device responds to the method with a result of 200 bytes.
The device consumes:
One message * 60 minutes * 24 hours = 1440 messages per day for the device-to-cloud messages.
One message * 60 minutes * 24 hours = 1440 messages per day for the device-to-cloud messages.
Two messages (request plus response) * 6 times per hour * 24 hours = 288 messages for the methods.
Two messages (request plus response) * 6 times per hour * 24 hours = 288 messages for the methods.
This calculation gives a total of 1728 messages per day.
Example #2
A device sends one 100-KB device-to-cloud message every hour. It also updates its device twin with 1-KB payloads every four hours. The solution back end, once per day, reads the 14-KB device twin and updates it with 512-byte payloads to change configurations.
The device consumes:
25 (100 KB / 4 KB) messages * 24 hours for device-to-cloud messages.
25 (100 KB / 4 KB) messages * 24 hours for device-to-cloud messages.
One message (1 KB / 4 KB) * six times per day for device twin updates.
One message (1 KB / 4 KB) * six times per day for device twin updates.
This calculation gives a total of 606 messages per day.
The solution back end consumes 4 messages (14 KB / 4 KB) to read the device twin, plus one message (512 / 4 KB) to update it, for a total of 5 messages.
In total, the device and the solution back end consume 611 messages per day.
Example #3
Depending on your scenario, batching messages can reduce your quota usage.
For example, consider a device that has a sensor that only generates 100 bytes of data each time it's read:
If the device batches 40 sensor reads into a single device-to-cloud message with a 4-KB payload (40 * 100 bytes), then only one message is charged against quota. If the device reads the sensor 40 times each hour and batches those reads into a single device-to-cloud message per hour, it would send 24 messages/day.
If the device batches 40 sensor reads into a single device-to-cloud message with a 4-KB payload (40 * 100 bytes), then only one message is charged against quota. If the device reads the sensor 40 times each hour and batches those reads into a single device-to-cloud message per hour, it would send 24 messages/day.
If the device sends a device-to-cloud message with a 100-byte payload for each sensor read, then it consumes 40 messages against quota for the same amount of data. If the device reads the sensor 40 times each hour and sends each message individually, it would send 960 messages/day (40 messages * 24).
If the device sends a device-to-cloud message with a 100-byte payload for each sensor read, then it consumes 40 messages against quota for the same amount of data. If the device reads the sensor 40 times each hour and sends each message individually, it would send 960 messages/day (40 messages * 24).
Your batching strategy depends on your scenario and on how time-critical the data is. If you're sending large amounts of data, you can also consider implementing data compression to further reduce the impact on message quota.
Example #4
When you open a support request on Azure portal, diagnostics specific to your reported issue are run. The result is displayed as an insight on theSolutionstab of your request. One such insight reports quota usage for your IoT hub using the terms in italics in the table earlier. Whether this particular insight is returned will depend on the results of the diagnostics performed on your IoT hub for the problem you're reporting. If the quota usage insight is reported, you can use the table to cross-reference the reported usage term or terms with the operation(s) that they refer to.
For example, the following screenshot shows a support request initiated for a problem with device-to-cloud telemetry.

After selectingNext Solutions, the quota usage insight is returned by the diagnostics underIoT Hub daily message quota breakdown. It shows the breakdown for device to cloud messages sent to the IoT hub. In this case, message routing is enabled on the IoT hub, so the messages are shown asDevice to Cloud Telemetry Routing. Be aware that the quota usage insight may not be returned for the same problem on a different IoT hub. What is returned will depend on the activity and state of that IoT hub.
