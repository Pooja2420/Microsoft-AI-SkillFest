Add users or groups to an access level
For on-premises deployments, you might need to set the access level for a user or group, particularly if those groups don't belong to the default access level. For more information, seeChange access levels.
Add users or groups to SQL Server Reports
If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you must manage membership for those products separately from their websites. SeeGrant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in Azure DevOps.
