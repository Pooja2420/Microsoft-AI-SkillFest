When you have applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by Media Services and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze and alert on this data.
Azure Monitor
Media Services creates monitoring data usingAzure Monitor, which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure that provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources in addition to resources in other clouds and on-premises.
Start with reading the articleMonitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor, which describes the following concepts:
What is Azure Monitor?
Costs associated with monitoring
Monitoring data collected in Azure
Configuring data collection
Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data
Media Services monitoring data
Media Services collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described inMonitoring data from Azure resources.
All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types: metrics and logs. With these two types you can:
Visualize and analyze the metrics data using Metrics Explorer.
Monitor Media Services diagnostic logs and create alerts and notifications for them.
You can send or stream logs to:Azure StorageAzure Event HubsLog AnalyticsUse third-party services
Azure Storage
Azure Event Hubs
Log Analytics

Collection and routing
Platform metricsand theActivity logare collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.
Resource Logsarenotcollected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.
See the articleCreate diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azurefor the detailed process of creating a diagnostic setting.
Media Services metrics
Media Services metrics are collected at regular intervals whether or not the value changes.
Metric types
Metrics available for Media Services are:
Media Services account metrics, including Key Delivery
Live event metrics
Streaming endpoint metrics
Analyzing metrics
You can analyze metrics for Media Services along with metrics from other Azure services using Metrics Explorer. SeeGetting started with Azure Metrics Explorerfor details on using this tool.
Media Services logs
Activity logs
TheActivity logis a platform log that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.
Resource logs
Resource logs provide rich and frequent data about the operation of an Azure resource. For more information, seeHow to collect and consume log data from your Azure resources.
Media Services supports the following resource logs:Microsoft.Media/mediaservices
Media Services diagnostic logs
Some things that you can examine with diagnostic logs are:
The number of licenses delivered by DRM type
The number of licenses delivered by policy
The latency on key delivery requests
The number of unauthorized license requests from clients
Analyzing logs
Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.
All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined inAzure Monitor resource log schema.
Alerts
Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system. You can set alerts on metrics, logs, and the activity log. For more information, seeAzure Monitor Alerts overview.
Schemas
For detailed description of the top-level diagnostic logs schema, seeSupported services, schemas, and categories for Azure Diagnostic Logs.
