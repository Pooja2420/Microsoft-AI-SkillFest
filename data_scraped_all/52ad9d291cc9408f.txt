APPLIES TO: All API Management tiers
Azure Front Door is a modern application delivery network platform providing a secure, scalable content delivery network (CDN), dynamic site acceleration, and global HTTP(s) load balancing for your global web applications. When used in front of API Management, Front Door can provide TLS offloading, end-to-end TLS, load balancing, response caching of GET requests, and a web application firewall, among other capabilities. For a full list of supported features, seeWhat is Azure Front Door?
Note
For web workloads, we highly recommend utilizingAzure DDoS protectionand aweb application firewallto safeguard against emerging DDoS attacks. Another option is to employAzure Front Dooralong with a web application firewall. Azure Front Door offersplatform-level protectionagainst network-level DDoS attacks. For more information, seesecurity baseline for Azure services.
This article shows how to:
Set up an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile in front of a publicly accessible Azure API Management instance: either non-networked, or a Developer or Premium instance injected in a virtual network inexternal mode.
Restrict API Management to accept API traffic only from Azure Front Door.
Tip
You can also configure Azure Front Door Premium to route traffic to an API Management gateway using aprivate endpoint.
Prerequisites
An API Management instance.If you choose to use a network-injected instance, it must be deployed in an external VNet. (Virtual network injection is supported in the Developer and Premium service tiers.)
If you choose to use a network-injected instance, it must be deployed in an external VNet. (Virtual network injection is supported in the Developer and Premium service tiers.)
Import one or more APIs to your API Management instance to confirm routing through Front Door.
Configure Azure Front Door
Create profile
For steps to create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile, seeQuickstart: Create an Azure Front Door profile - Azure portal. For this article, you may choose a Front Door Standard profile. For a comparison of Front Door Standard and Front Door Premium, seeTier comparison.
Configure the following Front Door settings that are specific to using the gateway endpoint of your API Management instance as a Front Door origin. For an explanation of other settings, see the Front Door quickstart.

Update default origin group
After the profile is created, update the default origin group to include an API Management health probe.
In theportal, go to your Front Door profile.
In theportal, go to your Front Door profile.
In the left menu, underSettingsselectOrigin groups>default-origin-group.
In the left menu, underSettingsselectOrigin groups>default-origin-group.
In theUpdate origin groupwindow, configure the followingHealth probesettings and selectUpdate:SettingValueStatusSelectEnable health probesPathEnter/status-0123456789abcdefProtocolSelectHTTPSMethodSelectGETInterval (in seconds)Enter30
In theUpdate origin groupwindow, configure the followingHealth probesettings and selectUpdate:
/status-0123456789abcdef

Update default route
We recommend updating the default route that's associated with the API Management origin group to use HTTPS as the forwarding protocol.
In theportal, go to your Front Door profile.
In the left menu, underSettingsselectOrigin groups.
Expanddefault-origin-group.
In the context menu (...) ofdefault-route, selectConfigure route.
SetAccepted protocolstoHTTP and HTTPS.
EnableRedirect all traffic to use HTTPS.
SetForwarding protocoltoHTTPS onlyand then selectUpdate.
Test the configuration
Test the Front Door profile configuration by calling an API hosted by API Management, for example, the Swagger Petstore API. First, call the API directly through the API Management gateway to ensure that the API is reachable. Then, call the API through Front Door.
Call an API directly through API Management
To call an API directly through the API Management gateway, you can use a command line client such ascurlor another HTTP client. A successful response returns a200 OKHTTP response and the expected data:
curl
200 OK

Call an API directly through Front Door
Call the same API operation using the Front Door endpoint configured for your instance. The endpoint's hostname in theazurefd.netdomain is shown in the portal on theOverviewpage of your Front Door profile. A successful response shows200 OKand returns the same data as in the previous example.
azurefd.net
200 OK
Restrict incoming traffic to API Management instance
Use API Management policies to ensure that your API Management instance accepts traffic only from Azure Front Door. You can accomplish this restriction using one or both of thefollowing methods:
Restrict incoming IP addresses to your API Management instances
Restrict traffic based on the value of theX-Azure-FDIDheader
X-Azure-FDID
Restrict incoming IP addresses
You can configure an inboundip-filterpolicy in API Management to allow only Front Door-related traffic, which includes:
Front Door's backend IP address space- Allow IP addresses corresponding to theAzureFrontDoor.Backendsection inAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags.NoteIf your API Management instance is deployed in an external virtual network, accomplish the same restriction by adding an inbound network security group rule in the subnet used for your API Management instance. Configure the rule to allow HTTPS traffic from source service tagAzureFrontDoor.Backendon port 443.
Front Door's backend IP address space- Allow IP addresses corresponding to theAzureFrontDoor.Backendsection inAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags.
Note
If your API Management instance is deployed in an external virtual network, accomplish the same restriction by adding an inbound network security group rule in the subnet used for your API Management instance. Configure the rule to allow HTTPS traffic from source service tagAzureFrontDoor.Backendon port 443.
Azure infrastructure services- Allow IP addresses 168.63.129.16 and 169.254.169.254.
Azure infrastructure services- Allow IP addresses 168.63.129.16 and 169.254.169.254.
Check Front Door header
Requests routed through Front Door include headers specific to your Front Door configuration. You can configure thecheck-headerpolicy to filter incoming requests based on the unique value of theX-Azure-FDIDHTTP request header that is sent to API Management. This header value is theFront Door ID, which is shown in the portal on theOverviewpage of the Front Door profile.
X-Azure-FDID
In the following policy example, the Front Door ID is specified using anamed valuenamedFrontDoorId.
FrontDoorId
<check-header name="X-Azure-FDID" failed-check-httpcode="403" failed-check-error-message="Invalid request." ignore-case="false">
        <value>{{FrontDoorId}}</value>
</check-header>
<check-header name="X-Azure-FDID" failed-check-httpcode="403" failed-check-error-message="Invalid request." ignore-case="false">
        <value>{{FrontDoorId}}</value>
</check-header>
Requests that aren't accompanied by a validX-Azure-FDIDheader return a403 Forbiddenresponse.
X-Azure-FDID
403 Forbidden
(Optional) Configure Front Door for developer portal
Optionally, configure the API Management instance's developer portal as an endpoint in the Front Door profile. While the managed developer portal is already fronted by an Azure-managed CDN, you might want to take advantage of Front Door features such as a WAF.
The following are high level steps to add an endpoint for the developer portal to your profile:
To add an endpoint and configure a route, seeConfigure and endpoint with Front Door manager.
To add an endpoint and configure a route, seeConfigure and endpoint with Front Door manager.
When adding the route, add an origin group and origin settings to represent the developer portal:Origin type- SelectCustomHost name- Enter the developer portal's hostname, for example,myapim.developer.azure-api.net
When adding the route, add an origin group and origin settings to represent the developer portal:
Origin type- SelectCustom
Host name- Enter the developer portal's hostname, for example,myapim.developer.azure-api.net
For more information and details about settings, seeHow to configure an origin for Azure Front Door.
Note
If you've configured anMicrosoft Entra IDorAzure AD B2Cidentity provider for the developer portal, you need to update the corresponding app registration with an additional redirect URL to Front Door. In the app registration, add the URL for the developer portal endpoint configured in your Front Door profile.
