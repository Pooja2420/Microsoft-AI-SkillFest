Setting the scope for a savings plan selects where the benefits apply.
You have the following options to scope a savings plan, depending on your needs:
Scope options
Resource group scope- Applies benefits to eligible resources in the selected resource group.
Subscription scope- Applies benefits to eligible resources in the selected subscription.
Management group- Applies benefits to eligible resources from all subscriptions that are in both:the management groupthe same Enrollment/Billing Profile as the subscription used to purchase the benefit
the management group
the same Enrollment/Billing Profile as the subscription used to purchase the benefit
Shared scope- Applies benefits to eligible resources within subscriptions that are in the EA Enrollment or MCA Billing Profile. The shared scope benefits applied to all Microsoft Entra tenants in the Enrollment/Billing Profile.
Scope processing order
While applying savings plan benefits to your usage, Azure processes savings plans in the following order:
Savings plans with resource group scope.
Savings plans with subscription scope.
Savings plans with management group scope.
Savings plans shared scope.
You can always update the scope after you buy a savings plan. To do so, go to the savings plan, selectConfiguration, and rescope the savings plan. Rescoping a savings plan isn't a commercial transaction, so your savings plan term isn't changed. For more information about updating the scope, seeUpdate the scopeafter you purchase a savings plan.
