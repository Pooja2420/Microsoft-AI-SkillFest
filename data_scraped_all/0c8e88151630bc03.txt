Move Azure SQL databases and elastic pools to a different Azure region
Note
Tutorials show the quickest path for trying out a scenario, and use default options.
Prerequisites
Before you begin:
Check if you haveOwneraccess on the subscription containing the resources that you want to move.The first time you add a resource for a  specific source and destination pair in an Azure subscription, Resource Mover creates asystem-assigned managed identity(formerly known as Managed Service Identify (MSI)) that's trusted by the subscription.To create the identity, and to assign it the required role (Contributor or User Access administrator in the source subscription), the account you use to add resources needsOwnerpermissions on the subscription.Learn moreabout Azure roles.
The first time you add a resource for a  specific source and destination pair in an Azure subscription, Resource Mover creates asystem-assigned managed identity(formerly known as Managed Service Identify (MSI)) that's trusted by the subscription.
To create the identity, and to assign it the required role (Contributor or User Access administrator in the source subscription), the account you use to add resources needsOwnerpermissions on the subscription.Learn moreabout Azure roles.
Check if the subscription has enough quota to create the resources you're moving in the target region. If it doesn't have quota,request more limits.
Verify pricing and charges associated with the target region to which you're moving resources. Use thepricing calculatorto help you.
Sign in to Azure
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin. Then sign in to theAzure portal.
Check SQL requirements
To check the SQL requirements before the move:
Checkwhich database/elastic pool features are supported for moving to another region.
In the target region, create a target server for each source server and ensure proper user access.Learn more about how to configure logins and users.
Check if the databases are encrypted with transparent data encryption (TDE). If databases are encrypted with transparent data encryption and you use your own encryption key in Azure Key Vault,learn how to move key vaults to another region.
If SQL data sync is enabled, moving the member databases is supported. After the move, you need to set up SQL data sync to the new target database.
Remove advanced data security settings before the move. After the move,configure the settingsat the SQL Server level in the target region.
If auditing is enabled, the policies reset to default after the move.Set up auditingagain after moving.
Back up retention policies for the source database are carried over to the target database.Learn moreabout modifying settings after the move.
Remove server-level firewall rules before the move. Database-level firewall rules are copied from the source server to the target server, during the move.Set up firewall rulesfor SQL Server in the target region after the move.
Remove autotuning settings before the move. Thenset up autotuningagain after moving.
Remove database alert settings before the move.Reset itafter moving.
Select resources
You can select any supported resource type in any resource groups in the selected source region. You move resources to a target region in the same subscription as the source region. If you want to change the subscription, you can do that after the resources are moved.
To select the resources you want to move, follow these steps:
In the Azure portal, search forresource mover. Then, underServices, selectAzure Resource Mover.

Note
The SQL Server is now in aManual assignment pendingstate.
Other added resources are in aPrepare pendingstate.
If you want to remove an resource from a move collection, the method for doing that depends on where you are in the move process.Learn more.
Resolve dependencies
To resolve the dependent resources you want to move, follow these steps:
Dependencies are auto-validated in the background when you add the resources. If the initial auto validation does not resolve the issue, you will see aValidate dependenciesoption, select it to validate manually.

Move SQL server
Azure Resource Mover currently doesn't move SQL server across regions. You must first assign a target SQL Server in the target region, and then commit the move.
To assign the destination resources manually, follow these steps:
Assign a target SQL server- To assign a target SQL server, follow these steps:InAcross regions, for the SQL server resource, in theDestination configurationcolumn, selectResource not assigned.Select an existing SQL Server resource in the target region.NoteThe source SQL Server state changes toCommit move pending.
Assign a target SQL server- To assign a target SQL server, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, for the SQL server resource, in theDestination configurationcolumn, selectResource not assigned.

Select an existing SQL Server resource in the target region.
Select an existing SQL Server resource in the target region.

Note
The source SQL Server state changes toCommit move pending.
Commit the SQL Server move- To commit a target SQL server and finish the move process, follow these steps:InAcross regions, select the SQL Server, and then selectCommit move.InCommit resources, selectCommit.Track the move progress in the notifications bar.NoteAfter the commit, the SQL Server is now in aDelete source pendingstate.

Note
After the commit, the SQL Server is now in aDelete source pendingstate.
Prepare resources to move
With the source SQL Server moved, you can prepare to move the other resources.
Prepare an elastic pool
To prepare an elastic pool for the move, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, select the source elastic pool (demo-test1-elasticpool in our walkthrough), and selectPrepare.
InAcross regions, select the source elastic pool (demo-test1-elasticpool in our walkthrough), and selectPrepare.

InPrepare resources, selectPrepare.
InPrepare resources, selectPrepare.
When  notifications show that the prepare process was successful, selectRefresh.
When  notifications show that the prepare process was successful, selectRefresh.
Note
The elastic pool is now in anInitiate move pendingstate.
Prepare a single database
To prepare a single database for the move, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, select the single database (not in an elastic pool), and then selectPrepare.
InAcross regions, select the single database (not in an elastic pool), and then selectPrepare.

InPrepare resources, selectPrepare.

When  notifications show that the prepare process was successful, selectRefresh.
Note
The database is now in anInitiate move pendingstate, and has been created in the target region.
Move the pool and prepare pool databases
To prepare databases in an elastic pool, the elastic pool must be in aCommit move pendingstate. To move to this state, initiate the move for the pool.
To initiate a move for an elastic pool, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, select the source elastic pool (demo-test1-elasticpool in our walkthrough), and then selectInitiate move.
InAcross regions, select the source elastic pool (demo-test1-elasticpool in our walkthrough), and then selectInitiate move.
InMove resources, selectInitiate move.
InMove resources, selectInitiate move.

Track the move progress in the notifications bar.

To prepare a database for the move, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, select the database (demo-test2-sqldb in our walkthrough), and then selectPrepare.
InAcross regions, select the database (demo-test2-sqldb in our walkthrough), and then selectPrepare.
InPrepare resources, selectPrepare.
InPrepare resources, selectPrepare.

During the prepare stage, the target database is created in the target region and the data replication starts. After Prepare, the database is in anInitiate move pendingstate.

Move databases
Now that you've prepared the resources prepared, you can initiate the move.
To move the databases, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, select resources with stateInitiate move pending. Then selectInitiate move.
InAcross regions, select resources with stateInitiate move pending. Then selectInitiate move.
InMove resources, selectInitiate move.
InMove resources, selectInitiate move.

Track the move progress in the notifications bar.

Note
Databases are now in aCommit move pendingstate.
Commit or discard the move
After the initial move, you can decide whether you want to commit the move, or to discard it.
Discard: You might want to discard a move if you're testing, and you don't want to actually move the source resource. Discarding the move returns the resource to a state ofInitiate move pending.
Commit: Commit completes the move to the target region. After committing, a source resource will be in a state ofDelete source pendingand you can decide if you want to delete it.
Discard the move
To discard the move, follow these steps:
InAcross regions, select resources with stateCommit move pending, and selectDiscard move.
InDiscard move, selectDiscard.
Track move progress in the notifications bar.
Note
After discarding resources, they're in anInitiate move pendingstate.
If there's only an elastic pool, discard progresses, and the elastic pool created in the target region is deleted.
If there's an elastic pool with associated databases in theCommit move pendingstate, you can't discard the elastic pool.
If you discard an SQL database, target region resources aren't deleted.
If you want to start the move again after discarding, select the SQL database, or elastic pool and initiate the move again.
Commit the move
Finish moving databases and elastic pools by following these steps:
Check that the SQL Server is aDelete source pendingstate.
Check that the SQL Server is aDelete source pendingstate.
Update database connection strings to the target region, before you commit.

Note
Some downtime occurs for SQL databases during the commit process.
Committed databases and elastic pools are now in aDelete source pendingstate.
After the commit, update database-related settings, including firewall rules, policies, and alerts, on the target database.
Delete source resources after commit
After the move, you can optionally delete resources in the source region.
Note
SQL Server servers can't be deleted from the portal and must be deleted from the resource property page.
On theAcross regionspane, select the name of the source resource that you want to delete.
SelectDelete source.
