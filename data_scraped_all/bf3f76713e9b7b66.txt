This article describes how to back up and restore the SQL Server databases using Azure Backup.
Azure Backup helps you to back up SQL Server databases to Azure via an Azure account. If you don't have one, you can create a free account in just a few minutes. For more information, seeCreate your Azure free account.
Note
When the trim is performed within the guest OS, the tracking of incremental blocks is reset, resulting in a full backup. The trim within the guest OS releases unused blocks of the virtual disk (VHDX) and optimizes the disk size. However, this reduces the size of the VHDX and changes the SequenceNumber of the tracked incremental blocks, resulting in a full backup size. Unless the purpose is to improve the efficiency of storage on the Hyper-V host side, we recommend you  to stop the trim process within the guest to avoid an increase in backup size.
Backup flow for SQL Server database
To back up a SQL Server database to Azure and to recover it from Azure:
Create a backup policy to protect SQL Server databases in Azure.
Create on-demand backup copies in Azure.
Recover the database from Azure.
Supported scenarios
DPM 2019 UR2 supports SQL Server Failover Cluster Instances (FCI) using Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV).
Protection ofSQL Server failover cluster instance with Storage Spaces Direct on AzureandSQL Server failover cluster instance with Azure shared disksis supported with this feature. The DPM server must be deployed in the Azure Virtual Machine to protect SQL FCI instance deployed on Azure VMs.
Prerequisites and limitations
If you've a database with files on a remote file share, protection will fail with Error ID 104. DPM doesn't support protection for SQL Server data on a remote file share.
DPM can't protect databases that are stored on remote SMB shares.
Ensure that theavailability group replicas are configured as read-only.
You must explicitly add the system accountNTAuthority\Systemto the Sysadmin group on SQL Server.
When you perform an alternate location recovery for a partially contained database, you must ensure that the target SQL instance has theContained Databasesfeature enabled.
When you perform an alternate location recovery for a file stream database, you must ensure that the target SQL instance has thefile stream databasefeature enabled.
Protection for SQL Server Always On:DPM detects Availability Groups when running inquiry at protection group creation.DPM detects a failover and continues protection of the database.DPM supports multi-site cluster configurations for an instance of SQL Server.

DPM supports multi-site cluster configurations for an instance of SQL Server.
When you protect databases that use the Always On feature, DPM has the following limitations:DPM will honor the backup policy for availability groups that's set in SQL Server based on the backup preferences, as follows:Prefer secondary - Backups should occur on a secondary replica except when the primary replica is the only replica online. If there are multiple secondary replicas available, then the node with the highest backup priority will be selected for backup. If only the primary replica is available, then the backup should occur on the primary replica.Secondary only - Backup shouldn't be performed on the primary replica. If the primary replica is the only one online, the backup shouldn't occur.Primary - Backups should always occur on the primary replica.Any Replica - Backups can happen on any of the availability replicas in the availability group. The node to be backed up from will be based on the backup priorities for each of the nodes.NoteBackups can happen from any readable replica -  that is, primary, synchronous secondary, asynchronous secondary.If any replica is excluded from backup, for exampleExclude Replicais enabled or is marked as not readable, then that replica won't be selected for backup under any of the options.If multiple replicas are available and readable, then the node with the highest backup priority will be selected for backup.If the backup fails on the selected node, then the backup operation fails.Recovery to the original location isn't supported.

SQL Server 2014 or above backup issues:SQL server 2014 added a new feature to create adatabase for on-premises SQL Server in Microsoft Azure Blob storage. DPM can't be used to protect this configuration.There are some known issues with "Prefer secondary" backup preference for the SQL Always On option. DPM always takes a backup from secondary. If no secondary can be found, then the backup fails.

Before you start
Before you begin, ensure you've met theprerequisitesfor using Azure Backup to protect workloads. Here are some of the prerequisite tasks:
Create a backup vault.
Download vault credentials.
Install the Azure Backup agent.
Register the server with the vault.
Create a backup policy
To protect SQL Server databases in Azure, first create a backup policy:
On the Data Protection Manager (DPM) server, select theProtectionworkspace.

On theSpecify Short-Term Goalspage, include the necessary inputs to create backup points to the disk.In this example,Retention rangeis set to5 days. The backupSynchronization frequencyis set to once every15 minutes.Express Full Backupis set to8:00 PM.NoteIn this example, a backup point is created at 8:00 PM every day. The data that has been modified since the previous day's 8:00 PM backup point is transferred. This process is calledExpress Full Backup. Although the transaction logs are synchronized every 15 minutes, if we need to recover the database at 9:00 PM, then the point is created by replaying the logs from the last express full backup point, which is 8:00 PM in this example.

SelectNext. DPM shows the overall storage space available. It also shows the potential disk space utilization.By default, DPM creates one volume per data source (SQL Server database). The volume is used for the initial backup copy. In this configuration, Logical Disk Manager (LDM) limits DPM protection to 300 data sources (SQL Server databases). To work around this limitation, selectCo-locate data in DPM Storage Pool. If you use this option, DPM uses a single volume for multiple data sources. This setup allows DPM to protect up to 2,000 SQL Server databases.If you selectAutomatically grow the volumes, then DPM can account for the increased backup volume as the production data grows. If you don't selectAutomatically grow the volumes, then DPM limits the backup storage to the data sources in the protection group.

If you're an administrator, you can choose to transfer this initial backupAutomatically over the networkand choose the time of transfer. Or choose toManuallytransfer the backup. Then selectNext.The initial backup copy requires the transfer of the entire data source (SQL Server database). The backup data moves from the production server (SQL Server computer) to the DPM server. If this backup is large, then transferring the data over the network could cause bandwidth congestion. For this reason, administrators can choose to use removable media to transfer the initial backupManually. Or they can transfer the dataAutomatically over the networkat a specified time.After the initial backup finishes, backups continue incrementally on the initial backup copy. Incremental backups tend to be small and are easily transferred across the network.

Choose when to run a consistency check. Then selectNext.DPM can run a consistency check on the integrity of the backup point. It calculates the checksum of the backup file on the production server (the SQL Server computer in this example) and the backed-up data for that file in DPM. If the check finds a conflict, then the backed-up file in DPM is assumed to be corrupt. DPM fixes the backed-up data by sending the blocks that correspond to the checksum mismatch. Because the consistency check is a performance-intensive operation, administrators can choose to schedule the consistency check or run it automatically.

If you're an administrator, you can choose backup schedules and retention policies that suit your organization's policies.In this example, backups are taken daily at 12:00 PM and 8:00 PM.TipFor quick recovery, keep a few short-term recovery points on your disk. These recovery points are used for operational recovery. Azure serves as a good offsite location, providing higher SLAs and guaranteed availability.Use DPM to schedule Azure Backups after the local disk backups finish. When you follow this practice, the latest disk backup is copied to Azure.
