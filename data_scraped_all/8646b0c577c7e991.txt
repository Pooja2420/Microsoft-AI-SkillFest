In this article
We announced the deprecation of Application Gateway V1 SKU (Standard and WAF) on April 28, 2023. The V1 SKU retires on April 28, 2026. For more information, seeMigrate your Application Gateways from V1 SKU to V2 SKU by April 28, 2026.
Azure Application Gateway and Web Application Firewall (WAF) V2now offer additional features such as autoscaling, availability, zone redundancy, higher performance, faster operations and improved throughput compared to V1. Also, all new features are released for V2 SKU. It's highly recommended for you to create a migration plan now.
V1 gateways aren't automatically upgraded to V2. Use this migration guide to help you plan and carry out the migrations.
There are two stages in a migration:
Migrate the configuration
Migrate the client traffic
This article primarily helps with the configuration migration. Client traffic migration varies depending on the environment. Somegeneral recommendations are providedin this article.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
An existing Application Gateway V1 Standard.
Make sure you have the latest PowerShell modules, or you can use Azure Cloud Shell in the portal.
If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to runConnect-AzAccountto create a connection with Azure.
Connect-AzAccount
Ensure that there's no existing Application gateway with the provided AppGW V2 Name and Resource group name in V1 subscription. This rewrites the existing resources.
If a public IP address is provided, ensure that it's in a succeeded state. If not provided and AppGWResourceGroupName is provided ensure that public IP resource with name AppGWV2Name-IP  doesnât  exist in a resource group with the name AppGWResourceGroupName in the V1 subscription.
For the V1 SKU, authentication certificates are required to set up TLS connections with backend servers. The V2 SKU requires uploadingtrusted root certificatesfor the same purpose. While V1 allows the use of self-signed certificates as authentication certificates, V2 mandatesgenerating and uploading a self-signed Root certificateif self-signed certificates are used in the backend.
Ensure that no other operation is planned on the V1 gateway or any associated resources during migration.
Azure Cloud Shell
Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.
To start Azure Cloud Shell:
To use Azure Cloud Shell:

Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Important
Run theSet-AzContext -Subscription <V1 application gateway SubscriptionId>cmdlet every time before running the migration script. This is necessary to set the active Azure context to the correct subscription, because the migration script might clean up the existing resource group if it doesn't exist in current subscription context. This is not a mandatory step for version 1.0.11 & above of the migration script.
Set-AzContext -Subscription <V1 application gateway SubscriptionId>
Important
A new stable version of the migration script, version 1.0.11 is available now, which contains important bug fixes and updates. Use this version to avoid potential issues.
Configuration migration
An Azure PowerShell script is provided in this document. It performs the following operations to help you with the configuration:
Creates a new Standard_V2 or WAF_V2 gateway in a virtual network subnet that you specify.
Seamlessly copies the configuration associated with the V1 Standard or WAF gateway to the newly created Standard_V2 or WAF_V2 gateway.
Downloading the script
You can download the migration script from thePowerShell Gallery.A new stable release (Version 1.0.11) of the migration script is available, which includes major updates and  bug fixes. It's recommended to use this stable version.
Using the script
Note
Run theSet-AzContext -Subscription <V1 application gateway SubscriptionId>cmdlet every time before running the migration script. This is necessary to set the active Azure context to the correct subscription, because the migration script might clean up the existing resource group if it doesn't exist in current subscription context.
This is not a mandatory step for version 1.0.11 & above of the migration script.
Set-AzContext -Subscription <V1 application gateway SubscriptionId>
There are two options for you depending on your local PowerShell environment setup and preferences:
If you don't have the Azure Az modules installed, or don't mind uninstalling the Azure Az modules, the best option is to use theInstall-Scriptoption to run the script.
Install-Script
If you need to keep the Azure Az modules, your best bet is to download the script and run it directly.
To determine if you have the Azure Az modules installed, runGet-InstalledModule -Name az. If you don't see any installed Az modules, then you can use theInstall-Scriptmethod.
Get-InstalledModule -Name az
Install-Script
To use this option, you must not have the Azure Az modules installed on your computer. If they're installed, the following command displays an error. You can either uninstall the Azure Az modules, or use the other option to download the script manually and run it.
Run the script with the following command to get the latest version:
Install-Script -Name AzureAppGWMigration -Force
Install-Script -Name AzureAppGWMigration -Force
This command also installs the required Az modules.
If you have some Azure Az modules installed and can't uninstall them (or don't want to uninstall them), you can manually download the script using theManual Downloadtab in the script download link. The script is downloaded as a raw nupkg file. To install the script from this nupkg file, seeManual Package Download.
Version 1.0.11 is the new version of the migration script which includes major bug fixes. It's recommended to use this stable version.
To check the version of the downloaded script the steps are as follows:
Extract the contents of the NuGet package.
Open the.PS1file in the folder and check the.VERSIONon top to confirm the version of the downloaded script

Caveats\Limitations
The new V2 gateway has new public and private IP addresses. It isn't possible to move the IP addresses associated with the existing V1 gateway seamlessly to V2. However, you can allocate an existing (unallocated) public or private IP address to the new V2 gateway.
You must provide an IP address space for another subnet within your virtual network where your V1 gateway is located. The script can't create the V2 gateway in a subnet that already has a V1 gateway. If the subnet already has a V2 gateway the script might still work, provided enough IP address space is available.
If you have a network security group or user defined routes associated to the V2 gateway subnet, make sure they adhere to theNSG requirementsandUDR requirementsfor a successful migration
Virtual network service endpoint policiesare currently not supported in an Application Gateway subnet.
To  migrate a TLS/SSL configuration, you must specify all the TLS/SSL certs used in your V1 gateway.
If you have FIPS mode enabled for your V1 gateway, it isn't migrated to your new V2 gateway. FIPS mode isn't supported in V2.
If you have a Private IP only V1 gateway, the script generates a private and public IP address for the new V2 gateway. The Private IP only V2 gateway is currently in public preview. Once it becomes generally available, customers can utilize the script to transfer their private IP only V1 gateway to a private IP only V2 gateway.
NTLM and Kerberos authentication isn't supported by Application Gateway V2. The script is unable to detect if the gateway is serving this type of traffic and may pose as a breaking change from V1 to V2 gateways if run.
WAFv2 is created in old WAF config mode; migration to WAF policy is required.
Traffic migration
First, double check that the script successfully created a new V2 gateway with the exact configuration migrated over from your V1 gateway. You can verify this from the Azure portal.
Also send a small amount of traffic through the V2 gateway as a manual test.
The following are a few scenarios where your current application gateway (Standard) may receive client traffic, and our recommendations for each one:
A custom DNS zone (for example, contoso.com) that points to the frontend IP address (using an A record) associated with your Standard V1 or WAF V1 gateway.You can update your DNS record to point to the frontend IP or DNS label associated with your Standard_V2 application gateway. Depending on the TTL configured on your DNS record, it may take a while for all your client traffic to migrate to your new V2 gateway.

A custom DNS zone (for example, contoso.com) that points to the DNS label (for example:myappgw.eastus.cloudapp.azure.comusing a CNAME record) associated with your V1 gateway.You have two choices:If you use public IP addresses on your application gateway, you can do a controlled, granular migration using a Traffic Manager profile to incrementally route traffic (weighted traffic routing method) to the new V2 gateway.You can do this by adding the DNS labels of both the V1 and V2 application gateways to theTraffic Manager profile, and CNAMEing your custom DNS record (for example,www.contoso.com) to the Traffic Manager domain (for example, contoso.trafficmanager.net).Or, you can update your custom domain DNS record to point to the DNS label of the new V2 application gateway. Depending on the TTL configured on your DNS record, it may take a while for all your client traffic to migrate to your new V2 gateway.

Your clients connect to the frontend IP address of your application gateway.Update your clients to use the IP address(es) associated with the newly created V2 application gateway. We recommend that you don't use IP addresses directly. Consider using the DNS name label (for example, yourgateway.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com) associated with your application gateway that you can CNAME to your own custom DNS zone (for example, contoso.com).

Pricing considerations
The pricing models are different for the Application Gateway V1 and V2 SKUs. V2 is charged based on consumption. SeeApplication Gateway pricingbefore migrating for pricing information.
Cost efficiency guidance
The V2 SKU comes with a range of advantages such as a performance boost of 5x, improved security with Key Vault integration, faster updates of security rules in WAF_V2, WAF Custom rules, Policy associations, and Bot protection. It also offers high scalability, optimized traffic routing, and seamless integration with Azure services. These features can improve the overall user experience, prevent slowdowns during times of heavy traffic, and avoid expensive data breaches.
There are five variants available in V1 SKU based on the Tier and Size - Standard_Small, Standard_Medium, Standard_Large, WAF_Medium and WAF_Large.
Note
The calculations shown here are based on East US and for a gateway with 2 instances in V1. The variable cost in V2 is based on one of the 3 dimensions with highest usage: New connections (50/sec), Persistent connections (2500 persistent connections/min), Throughput (1 CU can handle 2.22 Mbps).The scenarios described here are examples and are for illustration purposes only. For pricing information according to your region, see thePricing page.
