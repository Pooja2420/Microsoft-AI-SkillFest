You can useService Tagsto identify Azure SignalR Service traffic. A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes. Azure SignalR Service manages a service tag calledAzureSignalRfor both inbound and outbound traffic.
AzureSignalR
A service tag can be used when for configuringNetwork Security Group. Alternatively, you can query the IP address prefixes usingService Tag Discovery API.
Outbound traffic
Endpoints of Azure SignalR Service resources are guaranteed to be within IP ranges of Service TagAzureSignalR.

Note
Azure SignalR Service is a shared service. By allowing Service TagAzureSignalRor its associated IP address prefixes, you also allow traffic from other resources, even if they belong to other customers. Make sure you implement appropriate authentication on your endpoints.

Upstream endpoints of Azure Function
You can configure aservice tag-based rule.
Alternatively, you can useShared Private Endpointsfor better security. Shared Private Endpoints are dedicated to your resources. No traffic from other resources can access your endpoints.
Key vault access
We recommendShared Private Endpointsfor best security.
