In this article, learn how to update the Arc appliance credentials, upgrade the Arc resource bridge, and collect logs from the Arc resource bridge.
Update Arc appliance credential
Whenâ¯cloud adminâ¯credentials are updated, use the following steps to update the credentials in the appliance store.
Sign in to the Management VM from where the onboard process was performed. Change the directory toonboarding directory.

Note
Customers need to ensure kubeconfig and SSH keys remain available as they will be required for log collection, appliance Upgrade, and credential rotation. These parameters will be required at the time of upgrade, log collection, and credential update scenarios.
Parameters
Required parameters
-kubeconfig # kubeconfig of Appliance resource
-kubeconfig # kubeconfig of Appliance resource
Examples
The following command invokes the set credential for the specified appliance resource.
az arcappliance setcredential <provider> --kubeconfig <kubeconfig>
az arcappliance setcredential <provider> --kubeconfig <kubeconfig>
Upgrade the Arc resource bridge
Note
Arc resource bridges, on a supportedâ¯private cloud providerâ¯with an appliance version1.0.15 or higher, are automatically opted in tocloud-managed upgrade.â¯
Azure Arc-enabled Azure VMware Private Cloud requires the Arc resource bridge to connect your VMware vSphere environment with Azure. Periodically, new images of Arc resource bridge are released to include security and feature updates. The Arc resource bridge can be manually upgraded from the vCenter server. You must meet all upgradeâ¯prerequisitesâ¯before attempting to upgrade. The vCenter server must have the kubeconfig and appliance configuration files stored locally. If the cloudadmin credentials change after the initial deployment of the resource bridge,â¯update the Arc appliance credentialbefore you attempt a manual upgrade.
Arc resource bridge can be manually upgraded from the management machine. Themanual upgradegenerally takes between 30-90 minutes, depending on the network speed. The upgrade command takes your Arc resource bridge to the immediate next version, which might not be the latest available version. Multiple upgrades could be needed to reach aâ¯supported version. Verify your resource bridge version by checking the Azure resource of your Arc resource bridge.
Collect logs from the Arc resource bridge
Perform ongoing administration for Arc-enabled VMware vSphere bycollecting logs from the Arc resource bridge.
