This article describes how to manage change tracking, and includes the procedure on how you can change a workspace and configure data collection rule.
Note
Before using the procedures in this article, ensure that you've enabled Change Tracking and Inventory on your VMs. For detailed information on how you can enable, seeEnable change tracking and inventory from portal

Note
Ensure that ChangeTracking-Linux/ ChangeTracking-Windows extension version is upgraded to the current general release version:GA Extension Version
Use the following command to upgrade the extension version:
az vm extension set -n {ExtensionName} --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ChangeTrackingAndInventory --ids {VirtualMachineResourceId}
az vm extension set -n {ExtensionName} --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ChangeTrackingAndInventory --ids {VirtualMachineResourceId}
The extension for Windows isVms - ChangeTracking-Windowsand for Linux isVms - ChangeTracking-Linux.
Vms - ChangeTracking-Windows
Vms - ChangeTracking-Linux
Configure using wildcards
To configure the monitoring of files and folders using wildcards, do the following:
Wildcards are required for tracking multiple files.
Wildcards can only be used in the last segment of a path, such asâ¯C:\folder\fileâ¯orâ¯/etc/.conf*
If an environment variable includes a path that is not valid, validation will succeed but the path will fail when inventory runs.
When setting the path avoid general paths such asâ¯c:.** which will result in too many folders being traversed.
Disable Change Tracking from a virtual machine
To remove change tracking with Azure Monitoring Agent from a virtual machine, follow these steps:
Disassociate Data Collection Rule (DCR) from a VM
