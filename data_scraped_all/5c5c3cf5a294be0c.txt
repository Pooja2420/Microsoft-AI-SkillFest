Custom Web API skill in an Azure AI Search enrichment pipeline

TheCustom Web APIskill allows you to extend AI enrichment by calling out to a Web API endpoint providing custom operations. Similar to built-in skills, aCustom Web APIskill has inputs and outputs. Depending on the inputs, your Web API receives a JSON payload when the indexer runs, and outputs a JSON payload as a response, along with a success status code. The response is expected to have the outputs specified by your custom skill. Any other response is considered an error and no enrichments are performed. The structure of the JSON payload is described further down in this document.
TheCustom Web APIskill is also used in the implementation ofAzure OpenAI On Your Datafeature. If Azure OpenAI isconfigured for role-based accessand you get403 Forbiddencalls when creating the vector index, verify that Azure AI Search has asystem assigned identityand runs as atrusted serviceon Azure OpenAI.
403 Forbidden
Note
The indexer retries twice for certain standard HTTP status codes returned from the Web API. These HTTP status codes are:
502 Bad Gateway
502 Bad Gateway
503 Service Unavailable
503 Service Unavailable

Skill inputs
There are no predefined inputs for this skill. The inputs are any existing field, or anynode in the enrichment treethat you want to pass to your custom skill.
Skill outputs
There are no predefined outputs for this skill. Be sure todefine an output field mappingin the indexer if the skill's output should be sent to a field in the search index.

Sample input JSON structure
This JSON structure represents the payload that is sent to your Web API.
It always follows these constraints:
The top-level entity is calledvaluesand is an array of objects. The number of such objects are at most thebatchSize.

Each object in thevaluesarray has:ArecordIdproperty that is auniquestring, used to identify that record.Adataproperty that is a JSON object. The fields of thedataproperty correspond to the "names" specified in theinputssection of the skill definition. The values of those fields are from thesourceof those fields (which could be from a field in the document, or potentially from another skill).

Sample output JSON structure
The "output" corresponds to the response returned from your Web API. The Web API should only return a JSON payload (verified by looking at theContent-Typeresponse header) and should satisfy the following constraints:
Content-Type
There should be a top-level entity calledvalues, which should be an array of objects.

values
The number of objects in the array should be the same as the number of objects sent to the Web API.

Each object should have:ArecordIdproperty.Adataproperty, which is an object where the fields are enrichments matching the "names" in theoutputand whose value is considered the enrichment.Anerrorsproperty, an array listing any errors encountered that is added to the indexer execution history. This property is required, but can have anullvalue.Awarningsproperty, an array listing any warnings encountered that is added to the indexer execution history.

The ordering of objects in thevaluesin either the request or response isn't important. However, therecordIdis used for correlation so any record in the response containing arecordId, which wasn't part of the original request to the Web API is discarded.

Error cases
In addition to your Web API being unavailable, or sending out non-successful status codes the following are considered erroneous cases:
If the Web API returns a success status code but the response indicates that it isn'tapplication/jsonthen the response is considered invalid and no enrichments are performed.
If the Web API returns a success status code but the response indicates that it isn'tapplication/jsonthen the response is considered invalid and no enrichments are performed.
application/json
If there are invalid records (for example,recordIdis missing or duplicated) in the responsevaluesarray, no enrichment is performed for the invalid records. It's important to adhere to the Web API skill contract when developing custom skills. You can refer tothis exampleprovided in thePower Skill repositorythat follows the expected contract.

For cases when the Web API is unavailable or returns an HTTP error, a friendly error with any available details about the HTTP error is added to the indexer execution history.
