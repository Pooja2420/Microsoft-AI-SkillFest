Important
On September 30, 2027, network security group (NSG) flow logs will be retired. As part of this retirement, you'll no longer be able to create new NSG flow logs starting June 30, 2025. We recommendmigratingtovirtual network flow logs, which overcome the limitations of NSG flow logs. After the retirement date, traffic analytics enabled with NSG flow logs will no longer be supported, and existing NSG flow logs resources in your subscriptions will be deleted. However, NSG flow logs records won't be deleted and will continue to follow their respective retention policies. For more information, see theofficial announcement.
Network security group flow logging is a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log information about IP traffic flowing through a network security group. For more information about network security group flow logging, seeNSG flow logs overview.
This tutorial helps you use NSG flow logs to log a virtual machine's network traffic that flows through thenetwork security groupassociated to its network interface.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network
Create a virtual machine with a network security group associated to its network interface
Register Microsoft.insights provider
Enable flow logging for a network security group using Network Watcher flow logs
Download logged data
