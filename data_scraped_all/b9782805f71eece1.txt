Applies to:Azure SQL Managed Instance
In this quickstart, you'll use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to restore a database from Azure Blob Storage toAzure SQL Managed Instance. The quickstart restores the Wide World Importers sample database from a publicly available backup file using a SAS.

Use the restore wizard to restore from a backup file
In SSMS, take the steps in the following sections to restore the Wide World Importers database to SQL Managed Instance by using the restore wizard. The database backup file is stored in a preconfigured Blob Storage account.
Open the restore wizard
Open SSMS and connect to your SQL managed instance.
Open SSMS and connect to your SQL managed instance.
InObject Explorer, right-click theDatabasesfolder of your SQL managed instance, and then selectRestore Databaseto open the restore wizard.

Select the backup source
In the restore wizard, select the ellipsis (...) to select the source of the backup set to restore.

InSelect a Backup File Location, choose from one of three options to provide information about the location of your backup files:Select a preregistered storage container from theAzure storage containerlist.Enter a new storage container and a shared access signature. A new SQL credential will be registered for you.SelectAddto browse more storage containers from your Azure subscription.If you selectAdd, proceed to the next section,Browse Azure subscription storage containers. If you use a different method to provide the location of the backup files, skip toRestore the database.To restore the Wide World Importers sample database from publicly accessible read-only storage, provide the valuehttps://mitutorials.blob.core.windows.net/examples/and for the Shared Access Signature field, provide any value, such asSAS.

These steps aren't necessary to restore theWideWorldImporterssample database from the publicly-accessible read-only Azure blob storage, but are necessary to restore databases from your own Azure blob storage.

Restore the database
Now that you've selected a storage container, you should see theLocate Backup File in Microsoft Azuredialog.
In the left pane, expand the folder structure to show the folder that contains the backup files. In the right pane, select all the backup files that are related to the backup set that you're restoring, and then selectOK. For example, the following screenshot shows the publicly accessible read-only blob storage containing theWideWorldImporterssample database.SSMS validates the backup set. This process takes at most a few seconds. The duration depends on the size of the backup set.

SSMS validates the backup set. This process takes at most a few seconds. The duration depends on the size of the backup set.
If the backup is validated, you need to specify a name for the database that's being restored. By default, underDestination, theDatabasebox contains the name of the backup set database. To change the name, enter a new name forDatabase. SelectOK.The restore process starts. The duration depends on the size of the backup set.

When the restore process finishes, a dialog shows that it was successful. SelectOK.

Use T-SQL to restore from a backup file
As an alternative to the restore wizard, you can use T-SQL statements to restore a database. In SSMS, follow these steps to restore the Wide World Importers database to SQL Managed Instance by using T-SQL. The database backup file is stored in a preconfigured Blob Storage account.
Open SSMS and connect to your SQL managed instance.
Open SSMS and connect to your SQL managed instance.
InObject Explorer, right-click your SQL managed instance and selectNew Queryto open a new query window.

Run the following T-SQL statement, which uses publicly available preconfigured storage container and a shared access signature key tocreate a credentialin your SQL managed instance.ImportantCREDENTIALmust match the container path, begin withhttps, and can't contain a trailing forward slash.IDENTITYmust beSHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE.SECRETmust be the shared access signature token and can't contain a leading?.In this example,SECRETis omitted because the storage account is publicly available. If you use a storage account that isn't publicly available, you must provide a shared access signature token.CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://mitutorials.blob.core.windows.net/examples/WideWorldImporters-Standard.bak]
WITH IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE';The credential path in the previous example provides access to a single file. You can also create a shared access signature token to a folder path, for example:CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://<your storage>.blob.core.windows.net/databases/backups/]
WITH IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE'
, SECRET = '<your shared access signature>'; -- omit the leading ?

When the restore process finishes, view the database inObject Explorer. You can verify that the database is restored by using thesys.dm_operation_statusview.
When the restore process finishes, view the database inObject Explorer. You can verify that the database is restored by using thesys.dm_operation_statusview.
Note
A database restore operation is asynchronous and retryable. You might get an error in SSMS if the connection fails or a time-out expires. SQL Managed Instance keeps trying to restore the database in the background, and you can track the progress of the restore process by using thesys.dm_exec_requestsandsys.dm_operation_statusviews.
In some phases of the restore process, you see a unique identifier instead of the actual database name in the system views. To learn aboutRESTOREstatement behavior differences, seeT-SQL differences between SQL Server & Azure SQL Managed Instance.
