Hub-spoke network topology with Azure Virtual WAN
This hub-spoke architecture provides an alternate solution to the
reference architectureshub-spoke network topology in Azureandimplement a secure hybrid network.
Thehubis a virtual network in Azure that acts as a central point of connectivity to your on-premises network. Thespokesare virtual networks that peer with the hub and can be used to isolate workloads. Traffic flows between the on-premises data center(s) and the hub through an ExpressRoute or VPN gateway connection. The main differentiator of this approach is the use ofAzure Virtual WAN (VWAN)to replace hubs as a managed service.
This architecture includes the benefits of standard hub-spoke network topology and introduces new benefits:
Less operational overheadby replacing existing hubs with a fully managed VWAN service.

Spoke virtual networks. One or more virtual networks that are used as spokes in the hub-spoke topology. Spokes can be used to isolate workloads in their own virtual networks and are managed separately from other spokes. Each workload might include multiple tiers, with multiple subnets connected through Azure load balancers.

Virtual network peering. Two virtual networks can be connected using a VNet peering connection. Peering connections are nontransitive, low-latency connections between virtual networks. Once peered, virtual networks exchange traffic by using the Azure backbone, without the need for a router. In a hub-spoke network topology, you use virtual network peering to connect the hub to each spoke. Azure Virtual WAN enables transitivity among hubs, which isn't possible solely using peering.

Recommendations
The following recommendations apply to most scenarios. Follow them, unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.
Resource groups
The hub and each spoke can be implemented in different resource groups, and, even better, in different subscriptions. When you peer virtual networks in different subscriptions, both subscriptions can be associated to the same or a different Microsoft Entra tenant. This allows for a decentralized management of each workload, while sharing services maintained in the hub.
Virtual WAN

Standard Virtual WANs are by default connected in a full mesh. Standard Virtual WAN supports any-to-any connectivity (Site-to-Site VPN, VNet, ExpressRoute, Point-to-site endpoints) in a single hub as well as across hubs. Basic virtual WAN supports only Site-to-Site VPN connectivity, branch-to-branch connectivity, and branch-to-VNet connectivity in asingle hub.
Virtual WAN Hub
A virtual hub is a Microsoft-managed virtual network. The hub contains various service endpoints to enable connectivity. The hub is the core of your network in a region. There can be multiple hubs per Azure region. For more information, seeVirtual WAN FAQ.
When you create a hub using the Azure portal, it creates a virtual hub VNet and a virtual hub VPN gateway. A Virtual WAN Hub requires an address range minimum of /24. This IP address space will be used for reserving a subnet for gateway and other components.
Secured virtual hub
A virtual hub can be created as a secured virtual hub or converted to a secure one anytime after creation. For additional information, seeSecure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall Manager.
GatewaySubnet
For more information about setting up the gateway, seeHybrid network using a VPN Gateway.
For greater availability, you can use ExpressRoute plus a VPN for failover. SeeConnect an on-premises network to Azure using ExpressRoute with VPN failover.
A hub-spoke topology can't be used without a gateway, even if you don't need connectivity with your on-premises network.
Virtual network peering
Virtual network peering is a nontransitive relationship between two virtual networks. However, Azure Virtual WAN allows spokes to connect with each other without having a dedicated peering among them.
However, if you have several spokes that need to connect with each other, you will run out of possible peering connections very quickly due to the limitation on the number of virtual network peerings per virtual network. (For more information, seeNetworking limits.) In this scenario, Azure VWAN will solve this problem with its out-of-box functionality. For additional information, seeGlobal transit network architecture and Virtual WAN.
You can also configure spokes to use the hub gateway to communicate with remote networks. To allow gateway traffic to flow from spoke to hub, and connect to remote networks, you must:
Configure the peering connection in the hub toallow gateway transit.
Configure the peering connection in the hub toallow gateway transit.
Configure the peering connection in each spoke touse remote gateways.
Configure the peering connection in each spoke touse remote gateways.
Configure all peering connections toallow forwarded traffic.
Configure all peering connections toallow forwarded traffic.
For additional information, seeChoose between virtual network peering and VPN gateways.
Virtual network peering is a nontransitive relationship between two virtual networks. While using Azure Virtual WAN, virtual network peering is managed by Microsoft. Each connection added to a hub will also configure virtual network peering. With the help Virtual WAN, all spokes will have a transitive relationship.
Hub extensions
To support network-wide shared services like DNS resources, custom NVAs, Azure Bastion, and others, implement each service following thevirtual hub extension pattern. Following this model, you can build and operate single-responsibility extensions to individually expose these business-critical, shared services that you're otherwise unable to deploy directly in a virtual hub.
Connectivity among spokes is already achieved using Azure Virtual WAN. However, using UDRs in the spoke traffic is useful to isolate virtual networks. Any shared service can also be hosted on the same Virtual WAN as a spoke.
Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeWell-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability helps ensure that your application can meet the commitments that you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Azure Virtual WAN handles routing, which helps to optimize network latency among spokes as well as assure predictability of latency. Azure Virtual WAN also provides reliable connectivity among different Azure regions for the workloads spanning multiple regions. With this setup, end-to-end flow within Azure becomes more visible.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
Hubs in Azure VWAN can be converted to secure HUBs by leveraging Azure Firewall. User-defined routes (UDRs) can still be leveraged in the same way to achieve network isolation. Azure VWAN enables encryption of traffic between the on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks over ExpressRoute.
Azure DDoS Protection, combined with application-design best practices, provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to provide more defense against DDoS attacks. You should enableAzure DDOS Protectionon any perimeter virtual network.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization focuses on ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
Use theAzure Virtual WAN pricing pageto understand and estimate the most cost-effective solution for your network topology. Azure Virtual WAN pricing involves several key cost factors:
Deployment hours: Charges for the deployment and use of Virtual WAN hubs.
Scale unit: Fees based on the bandwidth capacity (Mbps/Gbps) for scaling VPN (S2S, P2S) and ExpressRoute gateways.
Connection unit: Costs for each connection to VPN, ExpressRoute, or remote users.
Data processed unit: Charges per GB for data processed through the hub.
Routing infrastructure unit: Costs for the routing capabilities in the hub.
Azure Firewall with Secured Virtual Hub: Recommended and adds an additional cost per deployment unit and data processed unit.
Hub-to-hub data transfer: Costs for transferring data between hubs subject to inter-region (intra/inter-continental) charges as detailed in theAzure bandwidth pricing.
For pricing aligned to common networking scenarios, seeAbout virtual WAN pricing.
Operational Excellence
Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Operational Excellence.
Azure VWAN is a managed service provided by Microsoft. From a technology standpoint, it isn't completely different from a customer-managed hub infrastructure. Azure Virtual WAN simplifies overall network architecture by offering a mesh network topology with transitive network connectivity among spokes. Monitoring of Azure VWAN can be achieved using Azure Monitor. Site-to-site configuration and connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure can be fully automated.
Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
With the help of Azure Virtual WAN, lower latency among spokes and across regions can be achieved. Azure Virtual WAN enables you to scale up to 20Gbps aggregate throughput.
Azure Virtual WAN provides a full mesh connectivity among spokes by preserving the ability to restrict traffic based on needs. With this architecture it's possible to have large-scale site-to-site performance. Moreover, you can create a global transit network architecture by enabling any-to-any connectivity between globally distributed sets of cloud workloads.
