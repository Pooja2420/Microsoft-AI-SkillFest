Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer Agreement billing readers can view amortized cost data for reservations. They can use the cost data to charge back the monetary value for a subscription, resource group, resource, or a tag to their partners. In amortized data, the effective price is the prorated hourly reservation cost. The cost is the total cost of reservation usage by the resource on that day.
Users with an individual subscription can get the amortized cost data from their usage file. When a resource gets a reservation discount, theAdditionalInfosection in the usage file contains the reservation details. For more information, seeView and download your Azure usage and charges.

The EffectivePrice for the usage that gets reservation discount is the prorated cost of the reservation (instead of being zero). This helps you know the monetary value of reservation consumption by a subscription, resource group or a resource, and can help you charge back for the reservation utilization internally. The dataset also has unused reservation hours.
Get Azure consumption and reservation usage data using API
You can get the data using the API or download it from Azure portal.
You call theUsage Details APIto get the new data. For details about terminology, seeusage terms.
Here's an example call to the Usage Details API:
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{enrollmentId}/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingPeriods/{billingPeriodId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usagedetails?metric={metric}&amp;api-version=2019-05-01&amp;$filter={filter}

For more information about {enrollmentId} and {billingPeriodId}, see theUsage Details â ListAPI article.
