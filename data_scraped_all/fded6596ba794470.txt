Virtual Network service endpoint provides secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Service Endpoints enables private IP addresses in the virtual network to reach the endpoint of an Azure service without needing a public IP address on the virtual network.
Note
Microsoft recommends use of Azure Private Link and private endpoints for secure and private access to services hosted on the Azure platform. Azure Private Link deploys a network interface into a virtual network of your choosing for Azure services such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL. For more information, seeAzure Private LinkandWhat is a private endpoint?.

Key benefits
Service endpoints provide the following benefits:
Improved security for your Azure service resources: Virtual network private address spaces can overlap. You can't use overlapping spaces to uniquely identify traffic that originates from your virtual network. Service endpoints enable securing of Azure service resources to your virtual network by extending virtual network identity to the service. Once you enable service endpoints in your virtual network, you can add a virtual network rule to secure the Azure service resources to your virtual network. The rule addition provides improved security by fully removing public internet access to resources and allowing traffic only from your virtual network.

Optimal routing for Azure service traffic from your virtual network: Today, any routes in your virtual network that force internet traffic to your on-premises and/or virtual appliances also force Azure service traffic to take the same route as the internet traffic. Service endpoints provide optimal routing for Azure traffic.Endpoints always take service traffic directly from your virtual network to the service on the Microsoft Azure backbone network. Keeping traffic on the Azure backbone network allows you to continue auditing and monitoring outbound Internet traffic from your virtual networks, through forced-tunneling, without impacting service traffic. For more information about user-defined routes and forced-tunneling, seeAzure virtual network traffic routing.

Simple to set up with less management overhead: You no longer need reserved, public IP addresses in your virtual networks to secure Azure resources through IP firewall. There isn't Network Address Translation (NAT) or gateway devices required to set up the service endpoints. You can configure service endpoints through a single selection on a subnet. There's no extra overhead to maintaining the endpoints.

For Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 1, the virtual network Integration capability is only available for virtual networks within the same region. Virtual network integration for ADLS Gen1 uses the virtual network service endpoint security between your virtual network and Microsoft Entra ID to generate extra security claims in the access token. These claims are then used to authenticate your virtual network to your Data Lake Storage Gen1 account and allow access. TheMicrosoft.AzureActiveDirectorytag listed under services supporting service endpoints is used only for supporting service endpoints to ADLS Gen 1. Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support service endpoints natively. For more information about Azure Data Lake Store Gen 1 virtual network integration, seeNetwork security in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1.

Secure Azure services to virtual networks
A virtual network service endpoint provides the identity of your virtual network to the Azure service. Once you enable service endpoints in your virtual network, you can add a virtual network rule to secure the Azure service resources to your virtual network.

Today, Azure service traffic from a virtual network uses public IP addresses as source IP addresses. With service endpoints, service traffic switches to use virtual network private addresses as the source IP addresses when accessing the Azure service from a virtual network. This switch allows you to access the services without the need for reserved, public IP addresses used in IP firewalls.NoteWith service endpoints, the source IP addresses of the virtual machines in the subnet for service traffic switches from using public IPv4 addresses to using private IPv4 addresses. Existing Azure service firewall rules using Azure public IP addresses stop working with this switch. Ensure Azure service firewall rules allow for this switch before setting up service endpoints. You might also experience temporary interruption to service traffic from this subnet while configuring service endpoints.

You might also experience temporary interruption to service traffic from this subnet while configuring service endpoints.
Secure Azure service access from on-premises
By default, Azure service resources secured to virtual networks aren't reachable from on-premises networks. If you want to allow traffic from on-premises, you must also allow public (typically, NAT) IP addresses from your on-premises or ExpressRoute. You can add these IP addresses through the IP firewall configuration for Azure service resources.
ExpressRoute: If you're usingExpressRoutefor Microsoft peering from your premises, identify the NAT IP addresses that you're using. The NAT IP addresses are either customer provided or provided by the service provider. To allow access to your service resources, you must allow these public IP addresses in the resource IP firewall setting. For more information about NAT for ExpressRoute Microsoft peering, seeExpressRoute NAT requirements.

Configuration
Configure service endpoints on a subnet in a virtual network. Endpoints work with any type of compute instances running within that subnet.

Considerations
After the service endpoint deployment, the source IP addresses switch from using public IPv4 addresses to using their private IPv4 address when communicating with the service from that subnet. Any existing open TCP connections to the service are closed during this switch. Ensure that no critical tasks are running when enabling or disabling a service endpoint to a service for a subnet. Also, ensure that your applications can automatically connect to Azure services after the IP address switch.The IP address switch only impacts service traffic from your virtual network. There's no effect to any other traffic addressed to or from the public IPv4 addresses assigned to your virtual machines. For Azure services, if you have existing firewall rules using Azure public IP addresses, these rules stop working with the switch to virtual network private addresses.

Network security groups (NSGs) with service endpoints:By default, NSGs allow outbound internet traffic and also allow traffic from your virtual network to Azure services. This traffic continues to work with service endpoints as is.If you want to deny all outbound internet traffic and allow only traffic to specific Azure services, you can do so usingservice tagsin your NSGs. You can specify supported Azure services as destination in your NSG rules and Azure also provides the maintenance of IP addresses underlying each tag.

Filtering outbound traffic from a virtual network to Azure services: If you want to inspect or filter the traffic sent to an Azure service from a virtual network, you can deploy a network virtual appliance within the virtual network. You can then apply service endpoints to the subnet where the network virtual appliance is deployed, and secure Azure service resources only to this subnet. This scenario might be helpful if you want use network virtual appliance filtering to restrict Azure service access from your virtual network only to specific Azure resources.

Logging and troubleshooting
Once you configure service endpoints to a specific service, validate that the service endpoint route is in effect by:
Validating the source IP address of any service request in the service diagnostics. All new requests with service endpoints show the source IP address for the request as the virtual network private IP address, assigned to the client making the request from your virtual network. Without the endpoint, the address is an Azure public IP address.

Service endpoint routes override any BGP or user-defined routes (UDRs) for the address prefix match of an Azure service. For more information, seetroubleshooting with effective routes.
Provisioning
Users with write access to a virtual network can independently configure service endpoints on virtual networks. To secure Azure service resources to a virtual network, users must have theMicrosoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/joinViaServiceEndpoint/actionpermission for the added subnets. The built-in service administrator roles include this permission by default, but you can modify it by creating custom roles.
For more information about built-in roles, seeAzure built-in roles. For more information about assigning specific permissions to custom roles, seeAzure custom roles.
Virtual networks and Azure service resources can be in the same or different subscriptions. Certain Azure Services (not all) such as Azure Storage and Azure Key Vault also support service endpoints across different Microsoft Entra ID tenants. The virtual network and Azure service resource can be in different Microsoft Entra ID tenants. Check individual service documentation for more details.
Pricing and limits
There's no extra charge for using service endpoints. The current pricing model for Azure services (Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, etc.) applies as-is today.
There's no limit on the total number of service endpoints in a virtual network.
Certain Azure services, such as Azure Storage Accounts, might enforce limits on the number of subnets used for securing the resource. Refer to the documentation for various services in theNext stepssection for details.
Virtual network service endpoint policies
Virtual network service endpoint policies allow you to filter virtual network traffic to Azure services. This filter allows only specific Azure service resources over service endpoints. Service endpoint policies provide granular access control for virtual network traffic to Azure services. For more information, seeVirtual Network Service Endpoint Policies.
