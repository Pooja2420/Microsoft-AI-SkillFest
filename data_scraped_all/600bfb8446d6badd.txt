Azure SQL Managed Instance
Azure SQL Database provides an industry leading high availability guarantee of at least 99.99% to support a wide variety of applications, including mission critical, thatalways need to be available. Azure SQL Database also has turn key business continuity capabilities that you can perform for quick disaster recovery in the event of a regional outage. This article contains valuable information to review in advance of application deployment.
Though we continuously strive to provide high availability, there are times when the Azure SQL Database service incurs outages that cause the unavailability of your database and thus impacts your application. When our service monitoring detects issues that cause widespread connectivity errors, failures or performance issues, the service automatically declares an outage to keep you informed.
Service outage
In the event of an Azure SQL Database service outage, you can find additional details related to the outage in the following places:

Service healthTheService Healthpage in the Azure portal contains information about Azure data center status globally. Search for `service health`` in the search bar in the Azure portal, then viewService issuesin theActive eventscategory. You can also view the health of individual resources in theResource healthpage of any resource under theHelpmenu. The following is sample screenshot of theService Healthpage, with information about an active service issue in Southeast Asia:

When to initiate disaster recovery during an outage
In the event of a service outage impacting application resources, consider the following courses of action:
The Azure teams work diligently to restore service availability as quickly as possible but depending on the root cause it can sometimes take hours. If your application can tolerate significant downtime, you can simply wait for the recovery to complete. In this case, no action on your part is required. View the health of individual resources in theResource healthpage of any resource under theHelpmenu. Refer to theResource healthpage for updates and the latest information regarding an outage. After the recovery of the region, your application's availability is restored.

After the recovery of the region, your application's availability is restored.
Recovery to another Azure region can require changing application connection strings or using DNS redirection, and might result in permanent data loss. Therefore, disaster recovery should be performed only when the outage duration approaches your application's recovery time objective (RTO). When the application is deployed to production, you should perform regular monitoring of the application's health and assert that the recovery is warranted only when there's prolonged connectivity failure from the application tier to the database. Depending on your application tolerance to downtime and possible business liability, you can decide if you want to wait for service to recover or initiate disaster recovery yourself.

Outage recovery guidance
If the Azure SQL Database outage in a region hasn't been mitigated for an extended period of time and is affecting your application's service-level agreement (SLA), consider the following steps:
Failover (no data loss) to geo-replicated secondary server
Ifactive geo-replicationorfailover groupsare enabled, check if the primary and secondary database resource status isOnlinein the Azure portal. If so, the data plane for both primary and secondary database is healthy. Initiate a failover of active geo-replication or failover groups to the secondary region by using the Azure portal, T-SQL, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.
Note
A failover requires full data synchronization before switching roles and does not result in data loss. Depending on the type of service outage there is no guarantee that failover without data loss will succeed, but it is worth trying as the first recovery option.
To initiate a failover, use the following links:
Forced failover (potential data loss) to geo-replicated secondary server
If failover doesn't complete gracefully and experiences errors, or if the primary database status isnotOnline, carefully consider forced failover with potential data loss to the secondary region.
To initiate a forced failover, use the following links:
--allow-data-loss
-AllowDataLoss
Geo-restore
If you haven't enabled active geo-replication or failover groups, then as a last resort, you can use geo-restore to recover from an outage. Geo-restore uses geo-replicated backups as the source. You can restore a database on any logical server in any Azure region from the most recent geo-replicated backups. You can request a geo-restore even if an outage has made the database or the entire region inaccessible.
For more information on geo-restores via Azure CLI, the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the REST API, seegeo-restore of Azure SQL Database.
Configure your database after recovery
If you're using geo-failover or geo-restore to recover from an outage, you must make sure that the connectivity to the new database is properly configured so that the normal application function can be resumed. This is a checklist of tasks to get your recovered database production ready.
Important
It is recommended to conductperiodic drills of your disaster recovery strategyto verify application tolerance, as well as all operational aspects of the recovery procedure. The other layers of your application infrastructure might require reconfiguration. For more information on resilient architecture steps, review theAzure SQL Database high availability and disaster recovery checklist.
Update connection strings
If you're usingactive geo-replicationorgeo-restore, you must make sure that the connectivity to the new databases is properly configured so that the normal application function can be resumed. Because your recovered database resides in a different server, you need to update your application's connection string to point to that server. For more information about changing connection strings, see the appropriate development language for yourconnection library.
If you're usingfailover groupsto recover from an outage and useread-write and read-only listenersin your application connection strings, then no further action is needed as connections are automatically directed to new primary.
Configure firewall rules
You need to make sure that the firewall rules configured on the secondary server and database match those that were configured on the primary server and primary database. For more information, seeHow to: Configure Firewall Settings.
Configure logins and database users
Create the logins that must be present in themasterdatabase on the new primary server, and ensure these logins have appropriate permissions in themasterdatabase, if any. For more information, seesecurity after disaster recovery.
master
master
Setup telemetry alerts
You need to make sure your existing alert rule settings are updated to map to the new primary database and the different server. For more information about database alert rules, seeReceive Alert NotificationsandTrack Service Health.
Enable auditing
If you have auditing configured on the primary server, make it identical on the secondary server.  For more information, seeAuditing.
