Workloads commonly span multiple cloud platforms. Cloud security services must do the same. Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps protect workloads in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but you need to set up the connection between them and Defender for Cloud.
This screenshot shows GCP accounts displayed in the Defender for Cloudoverview dashboard.

GCP authorization design
The authentication process between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and GCP is a federated authentication process.
When you onboard to Defender for Cloud, the GCloud template is used to create the following resources as part of the authentication process:
Workload identity pool and providers
Workload identity pool and providers
Service accounts and policy bindings
Service accounts and policy bindings
The authentication process works as follows:

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's CSPM service acquires a Microsoft Entra token. Microsoft Entra ID signs the token using the RS256 algorithm and is valid for 1 hour.

The Microsoft Entra token is exchanged with Google's STS token.
The Microsoft Entra token is exchanged with Google's STS token.
Google STS validates the token with the workload identity provider. The Microsoft Entra token is sent to Google's STS that validates the token with the workload identity provider. Audience validation then occurs and the token is signed. A Google STS token is then returned to Defender for Cloud's CSPM service.

When you're connecting GCP projects to specific Azure subscriptions, consider theGoogle Cloud resource hierarchyand these guidelines:
You can connect your GCP projects to Microsoft Defender for Cloud at theprojectlevel.
You can connect multiple projects to one Azure subscription.
You can connect multiple projects to multiple Azure subscriptions.
Connect your GCP project
There are four parts to the onboarding process that take place when you create the security connection between your GCP project and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Project details
In the first section, you need to add the basic properties of the connection between your GCP project and Defender for Cloud.

Here you name your connector, select a subscription and resource group, which is used to create an ARM template resource that is called security connector. The security connector represents a configuration resource that holds the projects settings.
You also select a location and add the organization ID for your project.
You can also set an interval to scan the GCP environment every 4, 6, 12, or 24 hours.
Some data collectors run with fixed scan intervals and aren't affected by custom interval configurations. The following table shows the fixed scan intervals for each excluded data collector:
When you onboard an organization, you can also choose to exclude project numbers and folder IDs.
Select plans for your project
After entering your organization's details, you'll then be able to select which plans to enable.

From here, you can decide which resources you want to protect based on the security value you want to receive.
Configure access for your project
Once you selected the plans, you want to enable and the resources you want to protect you have to configure access between Defender for Cloud and your GCP project.

In this step, you can find the GCloud script that needs to be run on the GCP project that is going to onboarded. The GCloud script is generated based on the plans you selected to onboard.
The GCloud script creates all of the required resources on your GCP environment so that Defender for Cloud can operate and provide the following security values:
Workload identity pool
Workload identity provider (per plan)
Service accounts
Project level policy bindings (service account has access only to the specific project)
Review and generate the connector for your project
The final step for onboarding is to review all of your selections and to create the connector.

Note
The following APIs must be enabled in order to discover your GCP resources and allow the authentication process to occur:
iam.googleapis.com
iam.googleapis.com
sts.googleapis.com
sts.googleapis.com
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
iamcredentials.googleapis.com
iamcredentials.googleapis.com
compute.googleapis.comIf you don't enable these APIs at this time, you can enable them during the onboarding process by running the GCloud script.
compute.googleapis.com
After you create the connector, a scan starts on your GCP environment. New recommendations appear in Defender for Cloud after up to 6 hours. If you enabled autoprovisioning, Azure Arc and any enabled extensions are installed automatically for each newly detected resource.
Connect your GCP organization
Similar to onboarding a single project, When onboarding a GCP organization, Defender for Cloud creates a security connector for each project under the organization (unless specific projects were excluded).
Organization details
In the first section, you need to add the basic properties of the connection between your GCP organization and Defender for Cloud.

Here you name your connector, select a subscription and resource group that is used to create an ARM template resource that is called security connector. The security connector represents a configuration resource that holds the projects settings.
You also select a location and add the organization ID for your project.
When you onboard an organization, you can also choose to exclude project numbers and folder IDs.
Select plans for your organization
After entering your organization's details, you'll then be able to select which plans to enable.

From here, you can decide which resources you want to protect based on the security value you want to receive.
Configure access for your organization
Once you selected the plans, you want to enable and the resources you want to protect you have to configure access between Defender for Cloud and your GCP organization.

When you onboard an organization, there's a section that includes management project details. Similar to other GCP projects, the organization is also considered a project and is utilized by Defender for Cloud to create all of the required resources needed to connect the organization to Defender for Cloud.
In the management project details section, you have the choice of:
Dedicating a management project for Defender for Cloud to include in the GCloud script.
Provide the details of an already existing project to be used as the management project with Defender for Cloud.
You need to decide what is your best option for your organization's architecture. We recommend creating a dedicated project for Defender for Cloud.
The GCloud script is generated based on the plans you selected to onboard. The script creates all of the required resources on your GCP environment so that Defender for Cloud can operate and provide the following security benefits:
Workload identity pool
Workload identity provider for each plan
Custom role to grant Defender for Cloud access to discover and get the project under the onboarded organization
A service account for each plan
A service account for the autoprovisioning service
Organization level policy bindings for each service account
API enablements at the management project level
Some of the APIs aren't in direct use with the management project. Instead the APIs authenticate through this project and use one of the APIs from another project. The API must be enabled on the management project.
Review and generate the connector for your organization
The final step for onboarding is to review all of your selections and to create the connector.

Note
The following APIs must be enabled in order to discover your GCP resources and allow the authentication process to occur:
iam.googleapis.com
iam.googleapis.com
sts.googleapis.com
sts.googleapis.com
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
iamcredentials.googleapis.com
iamcredentials.googleapis.com
compute.googleapis.comIf you don't enable these APIs at this time, you can enable them during the onboarding process by running the GCloud script.
compute.googleapis.com
After you create the connector, a scan starts on your GCP environment. New recommendations appear in Defender for Cloud after up to 6 hours. If you enabled autoprovisioning, Azure Arc and any enabled extensions are installed automatically for each newly detected resource.
Optional: Configure selected plans
By default, all plans areOn. You can turn off plans that you don't need.

Configure the Defender for Servers plan
Microsoft Defender for Servers brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your GCP virtual machine (VM) instances. To have full visibility into Microsoft Defender for Servers security content, connect your GCP VM instances to Azure Arc. If you choose the Microsoft Defender for Servers plan, you need:
Microsoft Defender for Servers enabled on your subscription. Learn how to enable plans inEnable enhanced security features.
Microsoft Defender for Servers enabled on your subscription. Learn how to enable plans inEnable enhanced security features.
Azure Arc for servers installed on your VM instances.
Azure Arc for servers installed on your VM instances.
We recommend that you use the autoprovisioning process to install Azure Arc on your VM instances. Autoprovisioning is enabled by default in the onboarding process and requiresOwnerpermissions on the subscription. The Azure Arc autoprovisioning process uses the OS Config agent on the GCP end.Learn more about the availability of the OS Config agent on GCP machines.
The Azure Arc autoprovisioning process uses the VM manager on GCP to enforce policies on your VMs through the OS Config agent. A VM that has anactive OS Config agentincurs a cost according to GCP. To see how this cost might affect your account, refer to theGCP technical documentation.
Microsoft Defender for Servers doesn't install the OS Config agent to a VM that doesn't have it installed. However, Microsoft Defender for Servers enables communication between the OS Config agent and the OS Config service if the agent is already installed but not communicating with the service. This communication can change the OS Config agent frominactivetoactiveand lead to more costs.

active
Alternatively, you can manually connect your VM instances to Azure Arc for servers. Instances in projects with the Defender for Servers plan enabled that aren't connected to Azure Arc are surfaced by the recommendationGCP VM instances should be connected to Azure Arc. Select theFixoption in the recommendation to install Azure Arc on the selected machines.
The respective Azure Arc servers for GCP virtual machines that no longer exist (and the respective Azure Arc servers with a status ofDisconnected or Expired) are removed after seven days. This process removes irrelevant Azure Arc entities to ensure that only Azure Arc servers related to existing instances are displayed.
Ensure that you fulfill thenetwork requirements for Azure Arc.
Enable these other extensions on the Azure Arc-connected machines:
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
A vulnerability assessment solution (Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management or Qualys)
Defender for Servers assigns tags to your Azure Arc GCP resources to manage the autoprovisioning process. You must have these tags properly assigned to your resources so that Defender for Servers can manage your resources:Cloud,InstanceName,MDFCSecurityConnector,MachineId,ProjectId, andProjectNumber.
