Azure Firewall Basicis a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources.

Azure Firewall Basic includes the following features:
Built-in high availability
Availability Zones
Application FQDN filtering rules
Network traffic filtering rules
FQDN tags
Service tags
Threat intelligence in alert mode
Outbound SNAT support
Inbound DNAT support
Multiple public IP addresses
Azure Monitor logging
Certifications
To compare Azure Firewall features for all Firewall versions, seeChoose the right Azure Firewall version to meet your needs.
Built-in high availability
High availability is built in, so no extra load balancers are required and there's nothing you need to configure.
Availability Zones
Azure Firewall can be configured during deployment to span multiple Availability Zones for increased availability. You can also associate Azure Firewall to a specific zone for proximity reasons. For more information on availability, see the Azure FirewallService Level Agreement (SLA).
There's no extra cost for a firewall deployed in more than one Availability Zone.
Azure Firewall Availability Zones are available in regions that support availability zones. For more information, seeRegions with availability zone support.
Application FQDN filtering rules
You can limit outbound HTTP/S traffic or Azure SQL traffic to a specified list of fully qualified domain names (FQDN) including wild cards. This feature doesn't require Transport Layer Security (TLS) termination.
The following video shows how to create an application rule:
Network traffic filtering rules
You can centrally create allow or deny network filtering rules by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. Azure Firewall is fully stateful, so it can distinguish legitimate packets for different types of connections. Rules are enforced and logged across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks.
Azure Firewall supports stateful filtering of Layer 3 and Layer 4 network protocols. Layer 3 IP protocols can be filtered by selecting Any protocol in the Network rule and select the wild-card * for the port.
FQDN tags
FQDN tagsmake it easy for you to allow well-known Azure service network traffic through your firewall. For example, say you want to allow Windows Update network traffic through your firewall. You create an application rule and include the Windows Update tag. Now network traffic from Windows Update can flow through your firewall.
Service tags
Aservice tagrepresents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation. You can't create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.
Threat intelligence
Threat intelligence-based filteringcan be enabled for your firewall to alert traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.
Outbound SNAT support
All outbound virtual network traffic IP addresses are translated to the Azure Firewall public IP (Source Network Address Translation). You can identify and allow traffic originating from your virtual network to remote Internet destinations. Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT when the destination IP is a private IP range perIANA RFC 1918.
If your organization uses a public IP address range for private networks, Azure Firewall will SNAT the traffic to one of the firewall private IP addresses in AzureFirewallSubnet. You can configure Azure Firewall to not SNAT your public IP address range. For more information, seeAzure Firewall SNAT private IP address ranges.
You can monitor SNAT port utilization in Azure Firewall metrics. Learn more and see our recommendation on SNAT port utilization in ourfirewall logs and metrics documentation.
For more detailed information about Azure Firewall NAT behaviors, seeAzure Firewall NAT Behaviors.
Inbound DNAT support
Inbound Internet network traffic to your firewall public IP address is translated (Destination Network Address Translation) and filtered to the private IP addresses on your virtual networks.
Multiple public IP addresses
You can associatemultiple public IP addresseswith your firewall.
Multiple public IP addresses enable the following scenarios:
DNAT - You can translate multiple standard port instances to your backend servers. For example, if you have two public IP addresses, you can translate TCP port 3389 (RDP) for both IP addresses.
SNAT - More ports are available for outbound SNAT connections, reducing the potential for SNAT port exhaustion. At this time, Azure Firewall randomly selects the source public IP address to use for a connection. If you have any downstream filtering on your network, you need to allow all public IP addresses associated with your firewall. Consider using apublic IP address prefixto simplify this configuration.
Azure Monitor logging
All events are integrated with Azure Monitor, allowing you to archive logs to a storage account, stream events to your event hub, or send them to Azure Monitor logs. For Azure Monitor log samples, seeAzure Monitor logs for Azure Firewall.
For more information, seeTutorial: Monitor Azure Firewall logs and metrics.
Azure Firewall Workbook provides a flexible canvas for Azure Firewall data analysis. You can use it to create rich visual reports within the Azure portal. For more information, seeMonitor logs using Azure Firewall Workbook.
Certifications
Azure Firewall is Payment Card Industry (PCI), Service Organization Controls (SOC), and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) compliant. For more information, seeAzure Firewall compliance certifications.
