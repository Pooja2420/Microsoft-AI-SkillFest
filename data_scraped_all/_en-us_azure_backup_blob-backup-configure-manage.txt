Azure Backup allows you to configure operational and vaulted backups to protect block blobs in your storage accounts. This article describes how to configure and manage backups on one or more storage accounts using the Azure portal. You can alsoconfigure backup using REST API.
Before you start
Operational backup
Vaulted backup
Operational backup of blobs is a local backup solution that maintains data for a specified duration in the source storage account itself. This solution doesn't maintain an additional copy of data in the vault. This solution allows you to retain your data for restore for up to 360 days. Long retention durations can, however, lead to longer time taken during the restore operation.
The solution can be used to perform restores to the source storage account only and can result in data being overwritten.
If you delete a container from the storage account by calling theDelete Container operation, that container can't be restored with a restore operation. Rather than deleting an entire container, delete individual blobs if you want to restore them later. Also, Microsoft recommends enabling soft delete for containers, in addition to operational backup, to protect against accidental deletion of containers.
Ensure that theMicrosoft.DataProtectionprovider is registered for your subscription.
For more information about the supported scenarios, limitations, and availability, see thesupport matrix.
Vaulted backup of blobs is a managed offsite backup solution that transfers data to the backup vault and retains as per the retention configured in the backup policy. You can retain data for a maximum of10 years.
Currently, you can use the vaulted backup solution to restore data to a different storage account only. While performing restores, ensure that the target storage account doesn't contain anycontainerswith the same name as those backed up in a recovery point. If any conflicts arise due to the same name of containers, the restore operation fails.
For more information about the supported scenarios, limitations, and availability, See thesupport matrix.
Create a Backup vault
ABackup vaultis a management entity that stores recovery points created over time and provides an interface to perform backup related operations. These include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies. Though operational backup of blobs is a local backup and doesn't "store" data in the vault, the vault is required for various management operations.
Note
The Backup vault is a new resource that is used for backing up new supported workloads and is different from the already existing Recovery Services vault.
For instructions on how to create a Backup vault, see theBackup vault documentation.
Grant permissions to the Backup vault on storage accounts
Operational backup also protects the storage account (that contains the blobs to be protected) from any accidental deletions by applying a Backup-owned Delete Lock. This requires the Backup vault to have certain permissions on the storage accounts that need to be protected. For convenience of use, these minimum permissions have been consolidated under theStorage Account Backup Contributorrole.
We recommend you to assign this role to the Backup vault before you configure backup. However, you can also perform the role assignment while configuring backup.
To assign the required role for storage accounts that you need to protect, follow these steps:
Note
You can also assign the roles to the vault at the Subscription or Resource Group levels according to your convenience.
In the storage account that needs to be protected, go to theAccess Control (IAM)tab on the left navigation blade.

Create a backup policy
A backup policy defines the schedule and frequency of the recovery points creation, and its retention duration in the Backup vault. You can use a single backup policy for your vaulted backup, operational backup, or both. You can use the same backup policy to configure backup for multiple storage accounts to a vault.
To create a backup policy, follow these steps:
Go toBusiness Continuity Center>Protection policies, and then select+ Create Policy>Create Backup Policy.
Go toBusiness Continuity Center>Protection policies, and then select+ Create Policy>Create Backup Policy.

Effects on backed-up storage accounts
Vaulted backup
Operational backup
In storage accounts (for which you've configured vaulted backups), the object replication rules get created under theObject replicationitem in the left blade.
Object replication requires versioning and change-feed capabilities. So, Azure Backup service enables these features on the source storage account.
Once backup is configured, changes taking place on block blobs in the storage accounts are tracked and data is retained according to the backup policy. You'll notice the following changes in the storage accounts for which backup is configured:
The following capabilities are enabled on the storage account. These can be viewed in theData Protectiontab of the storage account.Point in time restore for containers: With retention as specified in the backup policySoft delete for blobs: With retention as specified in the backup policy +5 daysVersioning for blobsBlob change feedIf the storage account configured for backup already hadPoint in time restore for containersorSoft delete for blobsenabled (before backup was configured), Backup ensures that the retention is at least as defined in the backup policy.

You can useAzure Business Continuity Centeras your single blade of glass for managing all your backups. Regarding backup for Azure Blobs, you can use Azure Business Continuity Center to do the following operations:
As we've seen above, you can use it for creating Backup vaults and policies. You can also view all vaults and policies under the selected subscriptions.

Stop protection
You can stop operational backup for your storage account according to your requirement.
Note
When you remove backups, theobject replication policyisn't removed from the source. So, you need to remove the policy separately. Stopping protection only dissociates the storage account from the Backup vault (and the backup tools, such as Backup center), and doesnât disable blob point-in-time restore, versioning, and change feed that were configured.
To stop backup for a storage account, follow these steps:
1.Go to the backup instance for the storage account being backed up.
You can go to the backup instance from the storage account viaStorage account>Data protection>Manage backup settings, or directly from the Business Continuity Center  viaBusiness Continuity Center>Protected Items, and then selectAzure Backupas aSolutionin the filter.

Selectstop backupfrom the menu.
Selectstop backupfrom the menu.

After stopping backup, you can disable other storage data protection capabilities (enabled for configuring backups) from the data protection blade of the storage account.
Update the backup instance
After you have configured the backup, you can change the associated policy with a backup instance. For vaulted backups, you can even change the containers selected for backup.
To update the backup instance, follow these steps:
Go to theBackup vaultdashboard.
Go to theBackup vaultdashboard.
On theBackup Itemstile, selectAzure Blobs (Azure Storage)as the datasource type.
