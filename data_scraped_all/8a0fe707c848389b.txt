This article presents the common troubleshooting scenarios to help you resolve issues you might encounter when creating an Azure Resource Manager service connection. SeeManage service connectionsto learn how to create, edit, and secure service connections.
What happens when you create an Azure Resource Manager service connection
If you don't have a service connection, you can create one as follows:
From within your project, selectProject settings, and then selectService connections.
From within your project, selectProject settings, and then selectService connections.

SelectNew service connectionto add a new service connection, and then selectAzure Resource Manager. SelectNextwhen you're done.

SelectSubscription, and then select your subscription from the drop-down list. Fill out the rest of the form and then selectSavewhen you're done.
When you save your new Azure Resource Manager service connection, Azure DevOps does the following actions:
Connects to the Microsoft Entra tenant for to the selected subscription.
Creates an application in Microsoft Entra ID on behalf of the user.
Assigns the application as a contributor to the selected subscription.
Creates an Azure Resource Manager service connection using this application's details.
Note
To create service connections, you need to be assigned the Creator or Administrator role for the Endpoint Creator group in your project settings:Project settings>Service connections>More Actions>Security. Project Contributors are added to this group by default.
Troubleshooting scenarios
The following issues might occur when you create service connections:
The user has only guest permission in the directory
The user isn't authorized to add applications in the directory
Failed to obtain an access token or a valid refresh token wasn't found
Failed to assign Contributor role
Subscription isn't listed when creating a service connection
Some subscriptions are missing from the list of subscriptions
Service principal's token expired
Failed to obtain the JSON web token (JWT) by using the service principal client ID
Azure subscription isn't passed from the previous task output
What authentication mechanisms are supported? How do managed identities work?

Old user token cached in Azure DevOps Services:If your Azure subscription isn't listed when you create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) service connection, it might be due to an old user token cached in Azure DevOps Services. This scenario isn't immediately obvious as the list screen of Azure subscriptions doesn't display any errors or warning messages indicating that the user token is outdated. To resolve this issue, manually update the cached user token in Azure DevOps Services by doing the following steps:Sign out of Azure DevOps Services and sign back in. This action can refresh the user token.Clear your browser cache and cookies to ensure that any old tokens are removed.From the Azure DevOps portal, go to the service connections, and reauthorize the connection to Azure. This step prompts Azure DevOps to use a new token.

Service principal's token expired
An issue that often arises with service principals or secrets that are automatically created is that the token expires and needs to be renewed. If you have an issue with refreshing the token, seeFailed to obtain an access token or a valid refresh token wasn't found.
If your token expired, you could see one of the error messages:
AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret is provided
AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret is provided
AADSTS7000222: The provided client secret keys for app '***' are expired
AADSTS7000222: The provided client secret keys for app '***' are expired
Invalid client id or client secret
Invalid client id or client secret
To renew the access token for an automatically created service principal or secret:
Go toProject settings>Service connections, and then select the service connection you want to modify.
Go toProject settings>Service connections, and then select the service connection you want to modify.
SelectEditin the upper-right corner.
SelectEditin the upper-right corner.
SelectSave.
SelectSave.
The token for your service principal or secret is now renewed for three more months.
Note
This operation is available even if the service principal's token has not expired.
Make sure that the user performing the operation has proper permissions on the subscription and Microsoft Entra ID, because it will update the secret for the app registered for the service principal. For more information, seeCreate an Azure Resource Manager service connection using automated securityandWhat happens when you create a Resource Manager service connection?
Failed to obtain the JWT by using the service principal client ID
This issue occurs when you try to save a service connection that has an expired secret or there are some other issues at the Entra ID level.
To resolve this issue:
Go toProject settings>Service connections, and then select the service connection you want to modify.
Go toProject settings>Service connections, and then select the service connection you want to modify.
SelectEditin the upper-right corner, and then make any change to your service connection. The easiest and recommended change is to add a description.

Note
If you get an error likeFailed to obtain the Json Web Token(JWT) using service principal client ID. Exception message: AADSTS7000112: Application is disabled., you need to work with your Entra ID team to confirm that the optionEnabled for users to sign-inin the enterprise application linked with your service principal is not disabled.
Failed to obtain the Json Web Token(JWT) using service principal client ID. Exception message: AADSTS7000112: Application is disabled.
Azure subscription isn't passed from the previous task output
When you set your Azure subscription dynamically for your release pipeline and want to consume the output variable from a preceding task, you might encounter this issue.
To resolve the issue, ensure that the values are defined within the variables section of your pipeline. You can then pass this variable between your pipeline's tasks.
What authentication mechanisms are supported? How do managed identities work?
An Azure Resource Manager service connection can connect to an Azure subscription by using a Service Principal Authentication (SPA) or managed identity authentication.
The Azure Resource Manager service connection can connect to an Azure subscription, management group, or machine learning workspace using:
App registration (recommended): You can authenticate the connection using a Workload identity federation or a secret.
Managed identity: Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID. You can also use an agent-assigned managed identity.
When setting up the service connection with a managed identity as the authentication method, the process doesnât create a new managed identity; it simply establishes the service connection. For this to function correctly, certain conditions must be met. Specifically, because managed identity is the chosen authentication method, there should be a system-assigned identity on the virtual machine you're using. Additionally, this virtual machine needs to act as a self-hosted agent within the pipelines for the workflow to fully execute, allowing the pipeline to deploy changes through the service connection. The system-assigned identity on the VM identifies that the same VM is serving as the agent in the pipeline, enabling authentication. This allows you to leverage the existing managed identity setup.
To learn about managed identities for virtual machines, seeAssigning roles.
Note
Managed identities aren't supported in Microsoft-hosted agents. In this scenario, you mustset up a self-hosted agenton an Azure VM and configure a managed identity for that VM.
