This article covers building a solution where you encrypt managed disks with customer-managed keys using Azure Key Vaults stored in a different Microsoft Entra tenant. This configuration can be ideal for several scenarios, one example being Azure support for service providers that want to offer bring-your-own encryption keys to their customers where resources from the service provider's tenant are encrypted with keys from their customer's tenant.
A disk encryption set with federated identity in a cross-tenant CMK workflow spans service provider/ISV tenant resources (disk encryption set, managed identities, and app registrations) and customer tenant resources (enterprise apps, user role assignments, and key vault). In this case, the source Azure resource is the service provider's disk encryption set.
If you have questions about cross-tenant customer-managed keys with managed disks, emailcrosstenantcmkvteam@service.microsoft.com.
Limitations
Managed Disks and the customer's Key Vault must be in the same Azure region, but they can be in different subscriptions.
This feature doesn't support Ultra Disks or Azure Premium SSD v2 managed disks.
This feature isn't available in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet or Government clouds.
About cross-tenant customer-managed keys
Many service providers building Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings on Azure want to offer their customers the option to manage their own encryption keys. Customer-managed keys allow a service provider to encrypt the customer's data using an encryption key that is managed by the service provider's customer and that isn't accessible to the service provider. In Azure, the service provider's customer can use Azure Key Vault to manage their encryption keys in their own Microsoft Entra tenant and subscription.
Azure platform services and resources that are owned by the service provider and that reside in the service provider's tenant require access to the key from the customer's tenant to perform the encryption/decryption operations.
The image below shows a data encryption at rest with federated identity in a cross-tenant CMK workflow spanning a service provider and its customer.

In the example above, there are two Microsoft Entra tenants: an independent service provider's tenant (Tenant 1), and a customer's tenant (Tenant 2).Tenant 1hosts Azure platform services andTenant 2hosts the customer's key vault.
A multitenant application registration is created by the service provider inTenant 1. Afederated identity credentialis created on this application using a user-assigned managed identity. Then, the name and application ID of the app is shared with the customer.
A user with the appropriate permissions installs the service provider's application in the customer tenant,Tenant 2. A user then grants the service principal associated with the installed application access to the customer's key vault. The customer also stores the encryption key, or customer-managed key, in the key vault. The customer shares the key location (the URL of the key) with the service provider.
The service provider now has:
An application ID for a multitenant application installed in the customer's tenant, which has been granted access to the customer-managed key.
A managed identity configured as the credential on the multitenant application.
The location of the key in the customer's key vault.
With these three parameters, the service provider provisions Azure resources inTenant 1that can be encrypted with the customer-managed key inTenant 2.
Let's divide the above end-to-end solution into three phases:
The service provider configures identities.
The customer grants the service provider's multitenant app access to an encryption key in Azure Key Vault.
The service provider encrypts data in an Azure resource using the CMK.
Operations in Phase 1 would be a one-time setup for most service provider applications. Operations in Phases 2 and 3 would repeat for each customer.

Phase 1 - The service provider configures a Microsoft Entra application
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates aren't recommended for creating Microsoft Entra applications.
The same multitenant application can be used to access keys in any number of tenants, likeTenant 2,Tenant 3,Tenant 4, and so on. In each tenant, an independent instance of the application is created that has the same application ID but a different object ID. Each instance of this application is thus authorized independently. Consider how the application object used for this feature is used to partition your application across all customers.Application can have a maximum of 20 federated identity credentials, which requires a service provider to share federated identities among its customers. For more information about federated identities design considerations and restrictions, seeConfigure an app to trust an external identity provider
Application can have a maximum of 20 federated identity credentials, which requires a service provider to share federated identities among its customers. For more information about federated identities design considerations and restrictions, seeConfigure an app to trust an external identity provider
In rare scenarios, a service provider might use a single Application object per its customer, but that requires significant maintenance costs to manage applications at scale across all customers.
In the service provider tenant, it isn't possible to automate thePublisher Verification.
Phase 2 - The customer authorizes access to the key vault
Recommended: Send the user tosign into your app. If the user can sign in, then a service principal for your app exists in their tenant.
UseMicrosoft Graph,Microsoft Graph PowerShell,Azure PowerShell, orAzure CLIto create the service principal.
Constructan admin-consent URLand grant tenant-wide consent to create the service principal using the application ID.
Note
To authorize access to the Managed HSM for encryption using CMK, see example for Storage Accounthere. For more information about managing keys with Managed HSM, seeManage a Managed HSM using the Azure CLI
In the customer tenant,Tenant 2, an admin can set policies to block non-admin users from installing applications. These policies can prevent non-admin users from creating service principals. If such a policy is configured, then users with permissions to create service principals need to be involved.
Access to Azure Key Vault can be authorized using Azure RBAC or access policies. When granting access to a key vault, make sure to use the active mechanism for your key vault.
A Microsoft Entra application registration has an application ID (client ID). When the application is installed in your tenant, a service principal is created. The service principal shares the same application ID as the app registration, but generates its own object ID. When you authorize the application to have access to resources, you might need to use the service principalNameorObjectIDproperty.
Name
ObjectID
Phase 3 - The service provider encrypts data in an Azure resource using the customer-managed key
After phases 1 and 2 are complete, the service provider can configure encryption on the Azure resource with the key and key vault in the customer's tenant and the Azure resource in the ISV's tenant. The service provider can configure cross-tenant customer-managed keys with the client tools supported by that Azure resource, with an ARM template, or with the REST API.
Configure cross-tenant customer-managed keys
This section describes how to configure a cross-tenant customer-managed key (CMK) and encrypt customer data. You learn how to encrypt customer data in a resource inTenant1using a CMK stored in a key vault inTenant2. You can use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

To create the key vault, the customer's account must be assigned theKey Vault Contributorrole or another role that permits creation of a key vault.
customerSubscriptionId="<customer-subscription-id>"
customerRgName="<customer-resource-group>"
customerLocation="<location>"
kvName="<key-vault>"

az group create --location $customerLocation \
    --name $customerRgName

az keyvault create --name $kvName \
    --location $customerLocation \
    --resource-group $customerRgName \
    --subscription $customerSubscriptionId \
    --enable-purge-protection true \
    --enable-rbac-authorization true
customerSubscriptionId="<customer-subscription-id>"
customerRgName="<customer-resource-group>"
customerLocation="<location>"
kvName="<key-vault>"

az group create --location $customerLocation \
    --name $customerRgName

az keyvault create --name $kvName \
    --location $customerLocation \
    --resource-group $customerRgName \
    --subscription $customerSubscriptionId \
    --enable-purge-protection true \
    --enable-rbac-authorization true
This step ensures that you can create the key vault and encryption keys.
currentUserObjectId=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv)

kvResourceId=$(az keyvault show --resource-group $customerRgName \
    --name $kvName \
    --query id \
    --output tsv)

az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" \
    --scope $kvResourceId \
    --assignee-object-id $currentUserObjectId
currentUserObjectId=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv)

kvResourceId=$(az keyvault show --resource-group $customerRgName \
    --name $kvName \
    --query id \
    --output tsv)

az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" \
    --scope $kvResourceId \
    --assignee-object-id $currentUserObjectId
To create the encryption key, the user's account must be assigned theKey Vault Crypto Officerrole or another role that permits creation of a key.
keyName="<key-name>"
az keyvault key create --name $keyName --vault-name $kvName
keyName="<key-name>"
az keyvault key create --name $keyName --vault-name $kvName
Assign the Azure RBAC roleKey Vault Crypto Service Encryption Userto the service provider's registered application, via the service principal that you created earlier, so that the registered application can access the key vault.
servicePrincipalId=$(az ad sp show --id $multiTenantAppId --query id --output tsv)

az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User" \
    --scope $kvResourceId \
    --assignee-object-id $servicePrincipalId
servicePrincipalId=$(az ad sp show --id $multiTenantAppId --query id --output tsv)

az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User" \
    --scope $kvResourceId \
    --assignee-object-id $servicePrincipalId
Now you can configure customer-managed keys with the key vault URI and key.
Create a disk encryption set
Now that you've created your Azure Key Vault and performed the required Microsoft Entra configurations, deploy a disk encryption set configured to work across tenants and associate it with a key in the key vault. You can do this using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. You can also use anARM templateorREST API.
