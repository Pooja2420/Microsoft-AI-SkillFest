By default, Event Hubs namespaces are accessible from internet as long as the request comes with valid authentication and authorization. With IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses or address ranges inCIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)notation.
This feature is helpful in scenarios in which Azure Event Hubs should be only accessible from certain well-known sites. Firewall rules enable you to configure rules to accept traffic originating from specific IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. For example, if you use Event Hubs withAzure Express Route, you can create afirewall ruleto allow traffic from only your on-premises infrastructure IP addresses.
IP firewall rules
You specify IP firewall rules at the Event Hubs namespace level. So, the rules apply to all connections from clients using any supported protocol. Any connection attempt from an IP address that doesn't match an allowed IP rule on the Event Hubs namespace is rejected as unauthorized. The response doesn't mention the IP rule. IP filter rules are applied in order, and the first rule that matches the IP address determines the accept or reject action.
Important points
This feature isn't supported in thebasictier.
Turning on firewall rules for your Event Hubs namespace blocks incoming requests by default, unless requests originate from a service operating from allowed public IP addresses. Requests that are blocked include the requests from other Azure services, from the Azure portal, from logging and metrics services, and so on. As an exception, you can allow access to Event Hubs resources from certaintrusted serviceseven when the IP filtering is enabled. For a list of trusted services, seeTrusted Microsoft services.
Specifyat least one IP firewall rule or virtual network rulefor the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network. If there are no IP and virtual network rules, the namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key).
Use Azure portal
When creating a namespace, you can either allow public only (from all networks) or private only (only via private endpoints) access to the namespace. Once the namespace is created, you can allow access from specific IP addresses or from specific virtual networks (using network service endpoints).
Configure public access when creating a namespace
To enable public access, selectPublic accesson theNetworkingpage of the namespace creation wizard.

After you create the namespace, selectNetworkingon the left menu of theEvent Hubs Namespacepage. You see thatAll Networksoption is selected. You can selectSelected Networksoption and allow access from specific IP addresses or specific virtual networks. The next section provides you details on configuring IP firewall to specify the IP addresses from which the access is allowed.
Configure IP firewall for an existing namespace
This section shows you how to use the Azure portal to create IP firewall rules for an Event Hubs namespace.
Navigate to yourEvent Hubs namespacein theAzure portal.

Therefore, we recommend that you add IPv6 addresses to the list of allowed IP addresses now so that your clients don't break when the service eventually switches to supporting IPv6.Specify whether you want toallow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall.

Use Resource Manager template
Important
The Firewall feature isn't supported in the basic tier.
The following Resource Manager template enables adding an IP filter rule to an existing Event Hubs namespace.
ipMaskin the template is a single IPv4 address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, in CIDR notation 70.37.104.0/24 represents the 256 IPv4 addresses from 70.37.104.0 to 70.37.104.255, with 24 indicating the number of significant prefix bits for the range.
Note
The default value of thedefaultActionisAllow. When adding virtual network or firewalls rules, make sure you set thedefaultActiontoDeny.

Important
If there are no IP and virtual network rules, all the traffic flows into the namespace even if you set thedefaultActiontodeny.  The namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key). Specify at least one IP rule or virtual network rule for the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network.
defaultAction
deny
Use Azure CLI
Useaz eventhubs namespace network-rule-setadd, list, update, and remove commands to manage IP firewall rules for an Event Hubs namespace.
az eventhubs namespace network-rule-set
Use Azure PowerShell
Use theSet-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSetcmdlet to add one or more IP firewall rules. An example from the article:
Set-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSet
$ipRule1 = New-AzEventHubIPRuleConfig -IPMask 2.2.2.2 -Action Allow
$ipRule2 = New-AzEventHubIPRuleConfig -IPMask 3.3.3.3 -Action Allow
$virtualNetworkRule1 = New-AzEventHubVirtualNetworkRuleConfig -SubnetId '/subscriptions/subscriptionId/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVirtualNetwork/subnets/default'
$networkRuleSet = Get-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -NamespaceName myNamespace
$networkRuleSet.IPRule += $ipRule1
$networkRuleSet.IPRule += $ipRule2
$networkRuleSet.VirtualNetworkRule += $virtualNetworkRule1
Set-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -NamespaceName myNamespace -IPRule $ipRule1,$ipRule2 -VirtualNetworkRule $virtualNetworkRule1,$virtualNetworkRule2,$virtualNetworkRule3
$ipRule1 = New-AzEventHubIPRuleConfig -IPMask 2.2.2.2 -Action Allow
$ipRule2 = New-AzEventHubIPRuleConfig -IPMask 3.3.3.3 -Action Allow
$virtualNetworkRule1 = New-AzEventHubVirtualNetworkRuleConfig -SubnetId '/subscriptions/subscriptionId/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVirtualNetwork/subnets/default'
$networkRuleSet = Get-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -NamespaceName myNamespace
$networkRuleSet.IPRule += $ipRule1
$networkRuleSet.IPRule += $ipRule2
$networkRuleSet.VirtualNetworkRule += $virtualNetworkRule1
Set-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -NamespaceName myNamespace -IPRule $ipRule1,$ipRule2 -VirtualNetworkRule $virtualNetworkRule1,$virtualNetworkRule2,$virtualNetworkRule3
Default action and public network access
REST API
The default value of thedefaultActionproperty wasDenyfor API version2021-01-01-preview and earlier. However, the deny rule isn't enforced unless you set IP filters or virtual network rules. That is, if you didn't have any IP filters or virtual network rules, it's treated asAllow.
defaultAction
Deny
Allow
From API version2021-06-01-preview onwards, the default value of thedefaultActionproperty isAllow, to accurately reflect the service-side enforcement. If the default action is set toDeny, IP filters and virtual network rules are enforced. If the default action is set toAllow, IP filters and virtual network rules aren't enforced. The service remembers the rules when you turn them off and then back on again.
defaultAction
Allow
Deny
Allow
The API version2021-06-01-preview onwardsalso introduces a new property namedpublicNetworkAccess. If it's set toDisabled, operations are restricted to private links only. If it's set toEnabled, operations are allowed over the public internet.
publicNetworkAccess
Disabled
Enabled
For more information about these properties, seeCreate or Update Network Rule SetandCreate or Update Private Endpoint Connections.
Note
None of the above settings bypass validation of claims via SAS or Microsoft Entra authentication. The authentication check always runs after the service validates the network checks that are configured bydefaultAction,publicNetworkAccess,privateEndpointConnectionssettings.

Azure portal
Azure portal always uses the latest API version to get and set properties. If you had configured your namespace using2021-01-01-preview and earlierwithdefaultActionset toDeny, and specified zero IP filters and virtual network rules, the portal would have previously checkedSelected Networkson theNetworkingpage of your namespace. Now, it checks theAll networksoption.
