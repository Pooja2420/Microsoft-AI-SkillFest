Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. Before authoring an application that works with Data Lake Storage Gen1, you must decide how to authenticate your application with Microsoft Entra ID.
Authentication options
End-user authentication- An end user's Azure credentials are used to authenticate with Data Lake Storage Gen1. The application you create to work with Data Lake Storage Gen1 prompts for these user credentials. As a result, this authentication mechanism isinteractiveand the application runs in the logged in user's context. For more information and instructions, seeEnd-user authentication for Data Lake Storage Gen1.

Service-to-service authentication- Use this option if you want an application to authenticate itself with Data Lake Storage Gen1. In such cases, you create a Microsoft Entra application and use the key from the Microsoft Entra application to authenticate with Data Lake Storage Gen1. As a result, this authentication mechanism isnon-interactive. For more information and instructions, seeService-to-service authentication for Data Lake Storage Gen1.
