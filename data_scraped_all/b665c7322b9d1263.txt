Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables comprehensive visibility, posture management, and threat protection across multicloud environments, including Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and on-premises resources.
DevOps security in Defender for Cloud uses a central console to help security teams protect applications and resources from code to cloud across multi-pipeline environments, including Azure DevOps, GitHub, and GitLab. DevOps security recommendations can be correlated with other contextual cloud security insights to prioritize remediation in code. Key DevOps security capabilities include:
Unified visibility into DevOps security posture: Security administrators have full visibility into DevOps inventory and the security posture of preproduction application code across multi-pipeline and multicloud environments. They can see findings from code, secrets, and open-source dependency vulnerability scans. They can alsoassess the security configurations of their DevOps environment.

Strengthen cloud resource configurations throughout the development lifecycle: You can secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates and container images to minimize cloud misconfigurations reaching production environments, allowing security administrators to focus on critical evolving threats.

Prioritize remediation of critical issues in code: Apply comprehensive code-to-cloud contextual insights within Defender for Cloud. Security admins help developers prioritize critical code fixes with pull request annotations and assign developer ownership by triggering custom workflows that feed directly into the tools developers use.

These features help unify, strengthen, and manage multi-pipeline DevOps resources.
Manage your DevOps environments in Defender for Cloud
DevOps security in Defender for Cloud lets you manage your connected environments. It provides your security teams with a high-level overview of issues discovered in those environments through theDevOps security console.

Here, you can addAzure DevOps,GitHub, andGitLabenvironments, customize theDevOps workbookto show your desired metrics,configure pull request annotations, view our guides, and give feedback.
Understand your DevOps security
Review your findings
The DevOps inventory table lets you review onboarded DevOps resources and their related security information.

In this section, you see:
Name- Lists onboarded DevOps resources from Azure DevOps, GitHub, and GitLab. Select a resource to view its health page.
