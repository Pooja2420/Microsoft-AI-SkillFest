Autoscaling is only available in Azure SignalR Service Premium tier.
Azure SignalR Service Premium tier supports anautoscalefeature, which is an implementation ofAzure Monitor autoscale. Autoscale allows you to automatically scale the unit count for your SignalR Service to match the actual load on the service. Autoscale can help you optimize performance and cost for your application.
Azure SignalR adds its ownservice metrics. However, most of the user interface is shared and common to otherAzure services that support autoscaling. If you're new to the subject of Azure Monitor Metrics, reviewAzure Monitor Metrics aggregation and display explainedbefore digging into SignalR Service Metrics.
Understanding autoscale in SignalR Service
Autoscale allows you to set conditions that will dynamically change the units allocated to SignalR Service while the service is running. Autoscale conditions are based on metrics, such asServer Load. Autoscale can also be configured to run on a schedule, such as every day between certain hours.
For example, you can implement the following scaling scenarios using autoscale.
Increase units when theConnection Quota Utilizationabove 70%.
Decrease units when theServer Loadis below 20%.
Create a schedule to add more units during peak hours and reduce units during off hours.
Multiple factors affect the performance of SignalR Service. No one metric provides a complete view of system performance. For example, if you're sending a large number of messages you might need to scale out even though the connection quota is relatively low. The combination of bothConnection Quota UtilizationandServer Loadgives an indication of overall system load. The following guidelines apply.
Scale out if the connection count is over 80-90%. Scaling out before your connection count is exhausted ensures that you'll have sufficient buffer to accept new connections before scale-out takes effect.
Scale out if theServer Loadis over 80-90%. Scaling early ensures that the service has enough capacity to maintain performance during the scale-out operation.
The autoscale operation usually takes effect 3-5 minutes after it's triggered. It's important not to change the units too often. A good rule of thumb is to allow 30 minutes from the previous autoscale before performing another autoscale operation. In some cases, you might need to experiment to find the optimal autoscale interval.
Custom autoscale settings
Open the autoscale settings page:
Go to theAzure portal.
Go to theAzure portal.
Open theSignalRservice page.
Open theSignalRservice page.
From the menu on the left, underSettingschooseScale out.
From the menu on the left, underSettingschooseScale out.
Select theConfiguretab. If you have a Premium tier SignalR instance, you'll see two options forChoose how to scale your resource:Manual scale, which lets you manually change the number of units.Custom autoscale, which lets you create autoscale conditions based on metrics and/or a time schedule.

ChooseCustom autoscale. Use this page to manage the autoscale conditions for your Azure SignalR service.

Default scale condition
When you open custom autoscale settings for the first time, you'll see theDefaultscale condition already created for you. This scale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions match the criteria set for them. You can't delete theDefaultcondition, but you can rename it, change the rules, and change the action taken by autoscale.
You can't set the default condition to autoscale on a specific days or date range. The default condition only supports scaling to a unit range. To scale according to a schedule, you'll need to add a new scale condition.
Autoscale doesn't take effect until you save the default condition for the first time after selectingCustom autoscale.
Add or change a scale condition
There are two options for how to scale your Azure SignalR resource:
Scale based on a metric- Scale within unit limits based on a dynamic metric. One or more scale rules are defined to set the criteria used to evaluate the metric.
Scale to specific units- Scale to a specific number of units based on a date range or recurring schedule.
Scale based on a metric
The following procedure shows you how to add a condition to increase units (scale out) when the Connection Quota Utilization is greater than 70% and decrease units (scale in) when the Connection Quota Utilization is less than 20%. Increments or decrements are done between available units.

Follow these steps to configure the rule to scale to a specific unit range.

SelectScale to a specific unitsforScale mode.
ForUnits, select the number of default units.
Add more conditions
The previous section showed you how to add a default condition for the autoscale setting. This section shows you how to add more conditions to the autoscale setting.
On theScale outpage, selectCustom autoscalefor theChoose how to scale your resourceoption.
SelectAdd a scale conditionunder theDefaultblock.
Confirm that theScale based on a metricoption is selected.
Select+ Add a ruleto add a rule to increase units when theConnection Quota Utilizationgoes above 70%. Follow steps from thedefault conditionsection.
Set theminimumandmaximumanddefaultnumber of units.
You can also set ascheduleon a custom condition (but not on the default condition). You can either specify start and end dates for the condition (or) select specific days (Monday, Tuesday, and so on.) of a week.If you selectSpecify start/end dates, select theTimezone,Start date and timeandEnd date and time(as shown in the following image) for the condition to be in effect.If you selectRepeat specific days, select the days of the week, timezone, start time, and end time when the condition should apply.
