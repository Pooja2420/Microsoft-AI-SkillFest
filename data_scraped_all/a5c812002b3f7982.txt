Important
Cloud Services (classic) is now deprecated for all customers as of September 1st, 2024. Any existing running deployments will be stopped and shut down by Microsoft and the data will be permanently lost starting October 2024. New deployments should use the new Azure Resource Manager based deployment modelAzure Cloud Services (extended support).
In theCloud Servicesarea of the Azure portal, you can:
Update a service role or a deployment.
Promote a staged deployment to production.
Link resources to your cloud service so that you can see the resource dependencies and scale the resources together.
Delete a cloud service or a deployment.
For more information about how to scale your cloud service, seeConfigure autoscaling for a cloud service in the portal.
Update a cloud service role or deployment
If you need to update the application code for your cloud service, useUpdateon the cloud service blade. You can update a single role or all roles. To update, you can upload a new service package or service configuration file.
In theAzure portal, select the cloud service you want to update. This step opens the cloud service instance blade.

Optionally, update the storage account and the deployment label.

If any roles have only one role instance, select theDeploy even if one or more roles contain a single instancecheck box to enable the upgrade to proceed.Azure can guarantee only 99.95 percent service availability during a cloud service update if each role has at least two role instances (virtual machines). With two role instances, one virtual machine processes client requests while the other is updated.

Swap deployments to promote a staged deployment to production
When you decide to deploy a new release of a cloud service, stage and test your new release in your cloud service staging environment. UseSwapto switch the URLs by which the two deployments are addressed and promote a new release to production.
You can swap deployments from theCloud Servicespage or the dashboard.
In theAzure portal, select the cloud service you want to update. This step opens the cloud service instance blade.

Common questions about swapping deployments
What are the prerequisites for swapping deployments?
There are two key prerequisites for a successful deployment swap:
If you want to use a static IP address for your production slot, you must reserve one for your staging slot as well. Otherwise, the swap fails.
If you want to use a static IP address for your production slot, you must reserve one for your staging slot as well. Otherwise, the swap fails.
All instances of your roles must be running before you can perform the swap. You can check the status of your instances on theOverviewblade of the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can use theGet-AzureRolecommand in Windows PowerShell.

Note
Guest OS updates and service healing operations also can cause deployment swaps to fail. For more information, seeTroubleshoot cloud service deployment problems.
Does a swap incur downtime for my application? How should I handle it?
As described in the previous section, a deployment swap is typically fast because it's just a configuration change in the Azure load balancer. In some cases, it can take 10 or more seconds and result in transient connection failures. To limit the impact to your customers, consider implementingclient retry logic.
Delete deployments and a cloud service
Before you can delete a cloud service, you must delete each existing deployment.
To save compute costs, you can delete the staging deployment after you verify that your production deployment is working as expected. Even if you stop your deployed role instances, Azure bills you for compute costs.
Use the following procedure to delete a deployment or your cloud service.
In theAzure portal, select the cloud service you want to delete. This step opens the cloud service instance blade.
In theAzure portal, select the cloud service you want to delete. This step opens the cloud service instance blade.
On the blade, selectDelete.
On the blade, selectDelete.

To delete the entire cloud service, select theCloud service and its deploymentscheck box. Or you can choose either theProduction deploymentor theStaging deploymentcheck box.

Note
When a cloud service is deleted and verbose monitoring is configured, you must delete the data manually from your storage account. For information about where to find the metrics tables, seeIntroduction to cloud service monitoring.
Find more information about failed deployments
TheOverviewblade has a status bar at the top. When you select the bar, a new blade opens and displays any error information. If the deployment doesn't contain any errors, the information blade is blank.
