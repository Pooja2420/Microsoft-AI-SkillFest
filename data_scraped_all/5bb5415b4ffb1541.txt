Dissociate a public IP address from a VM
In this step, you dissociate a public IP address from a virtual machine using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. The IP address is associated to an IP configuration of a network interface attached to the VM.
Azure portal
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Browse to, or search for the virtual machine that you want to disassociate the public IP address from and then select it.
In the VM page, selectOverview, and then select the public IP address.
In the public IP address page, selectOverview, and then selectDissociate.
InDissociate public IP address, selectYes.
In this task, you use theaz network nic-ip-config updatecommand to dissociate a public IP address from an IP configuration.
Dissociate IP address
The following example dissociates a public IP address namedmyVMPublicIPfrom an IP configuration namedipconfigmyVMof an existing network interface namedmyVMNicthat is attached to a VM namedmyVMin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup.
# Dissociate the public IP address from the IP configuration
az network nic ip-config update \
 --name ipconfigmyVM \
 --resource-group myResourceGroup \
 --nic-name myVMNic \
 --public-ip-address null
# Dissociate the public IP address from the IP configuration
az network nic ip-config update \
 --name ipconfigmyVM \
 --resource-group myResourceGroup \
 --nic-name myVMNic \
 --public-ip-address null
Discover name of network interface
If you don't know the name of the network interface attached to your VM, use theaz vm nic listcommand to view them. For example, the following command lists the names of the network interfaces attached to a VM namedmyVMin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
# List the network interfaces attached to a VM
az vm nic list --vm-name myVM --resource-group myResourceGroup
# List the network interfaces attached to a VM
az vm nic list --vm-name myVM --resource-group myResourceGroup
The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the following example:
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic",
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic",
In the previous example,myVMVicis the name of the network interface.
Discover name of IP configuration
If you don't know the name of the IP configuration of a network interface, use theaz network nic ip-config listcommand to retrieve them. For example, the following command lists the names of the IP configurations for a network interface namedmyVMNicin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
# List the IP configurations of a network interface
az network nic ip-config list --nic-name myVMNic --resource-group myResourceGroup --out table
# List the IP configurations of a network interface
az network nic ip-config list --nic-name myVMNic --resource-group myResourceGroup --out table
The output is similar to the following example:
Name           Primary    PrivateIpAddress    PrivateIpAddressVersion    PrivateIpAllocationMethod    ProvisioningState    ResourceGroup
------------   ---------  ------------------  -------------------------  ---------------------------  -------------------  ---------------
ipconfigmyVM   True       10.0.0.4            IPv4                       Dynamic                      Succeeded            myResourceGroup
Name           Primary    PrivateIpAddress    PrivateIpAddressVersion    PrivateIpAllocationMethod    ProvisioningState    ResourceGroup
------------   ---------  ------------------  -------------------------  ---------------------------  -------------------  ---------------
ipconfigmyVM   True       10.0.0.4            IPv4                       Dynamic                      Succeeded            myResourceGroup
In the previous example,ipconfigmyVMis the name of the IP configuration.
Discover name of public IP address
If you don't know the name of the public IP address associated to an IP configuration, use theaz network nic ip-config showcommand to retrieve them. For example, the following command lists the names of the public IP addresses for a network interface namedmyVMNicin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
# Get the name of public IP address associated to an IP configuration
az network nic ip-config show --name ipconfigmyVM --nic-name myVMNic --resource-group myResourceGroup --query publicIpAddress.id
# Get the name of public IP address associated to an IP configuration
az network nic ip-config show --name ipconfigmyVM --nic-name myVMNic --resource-group myResourceGroup --query publicIpAddress.id
The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the following example:
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myVMPublicIP",
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myVMPublicIP",
In the previous example,myVMPublicIPis the name of the public IP address.
In this task, you use theGet-AzNetworkInterfacecommand to get a network interface. Set the Public IP address value to null and then use theSet-AzNetworkInterfacecommand to write the new IP configuration to the network interface.
Dissociate IP address
The following example dissociates a public IP address namedmyVMPublicIPfrom a network interface namedmyVMNicthat is attached to a VM namedmyVM. All resources are in a resource group namedmyResourceGroup.
# Dissociate the public IP address from the network interface
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroup myResourceGroup
$nic.IpConfigurations[0].PublicIpAddress = $null
Set-AzNetworkInterface -NetworkInterface $nic
# Dissociate the public IP address from the network interface
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroup myResourceGroup
$nic.IpConfigurations[0].PublicIpAddress = $null
Set-AzNetworkInterface -NetworkInterface $nic
Discover name of network interface
If you don't know the name of the network interface attached to your VM, use theGet-AzVMcommand to view them. For example, the following command lists the names of the network interfaces attached to a VM namedmyVMin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
# Get the network interface attached to a VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -name myVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$vm.NetworkProfile
# Get the network interface attached to a VM
$vm = Get-AzVM -name myVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$vm.NetworkProfile
The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the following example:
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic",
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic",
In the previous example,myVMNicis the name of the network interface.
Discover name of IP configuration
If you don't know the name of an IP configuration for a network interface, use theGet-AzNetworkInterfacecommand to retrieve them. For example, the following command lists the names of the IP configurations for a network interface namedmyVMNicin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
# Get the name of the IP configuration for a network interface
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$nic.IPConfigurations.Id
# Get the name of the IP configuration for a network interface
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$nic.IPConfigurations.Id
The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the following example:
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic/ipConfigurations/ipconfigmyVM"
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic/ipConfigurations/ipconfigmyVM"
In the previous example,ipconfigmyVMis the name of the IP configuration.
Discover name of public IP address
If you don't know the name of the public IP address associated to an IP configuration, use theGet-AzNetworkInterfacecommand to retrieve them. For example, the following command lists the name of the public IP addresses for a network interface namedmyVMNicin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
# Get the name of the public IP address associated to an IP configuration
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$nic.IPConfigurations.PublicIpAddress.Id
# Get the name of the public IP address associated to an IP configuration
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
$nic.IPConfigurations.PublicIpAddress.Id
The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the following example:
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP"
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP"
In the previous example,myVMPublicIPis the name of the public IP address.
