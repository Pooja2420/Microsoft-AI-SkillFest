In this article, you learn how to create a hub and spoke network topology with Azure Virtual Network Manager. With this configuration, you select a virtual network to act as a hub and all spoke virtual networks have bi-directional peering with only the hub by default. You also can enable direct connectivity between spoke virtual networks and enable the spoke virtual networks to use the virtual network gateway in the hub.
Prerequisites
Read aboutHub-and-spokenetwork topology.
Created aAzure Virtual Network Manager instance.
Identify virtual networks you want to use in the hub-and-spokes configuration or create newvirtual networks.
Create a network group
This section helps you create a network group containing the virtual networks you're using for the hub-and-spoke network topology.
Note
This how-to guide assumes you created a network manager instance using thequickstartguide.

Define network group members
Azure Virtual Network manager allows you two methods for adding membership to a network group. You can manually add virtual networks or use Azure Policy to dynamically add virtual networks based on conditions. This how-to coversmanually adding membership. For information on defining group membership with Azure Policy, seeDefine network group membership with Azure Policy.
Manually adding virtual networks
To manually add the desired virtual networks for your Mesh configuration to your Network Group, follow the steps below:
From the list of network groups, select your network group and selectAdd virtual networksunderManually add memberson the network group page.

Deploy the hub and spoke configuration
To have this configuration take effect in your environment, you need to deploy the configuration to the regions where your selected virtual networks are created.
SelectDeploymentsunderSettings, then selectDeploy a configuration.
SelectDeploymentsunderSettings, then selectDeploy a configuration.
On theDeploy a configurationpage, select the following settings:SettingValueConfigurationsSelectInclude connectivity configurations in your goal state.Connectivity configurationsSelect the name of the configuration you created in the previous section.Target regionsSelect all the regions that apply to virtual networks you select for the configuration.
On theDeploy a configurationpage, select the following settings:
SelectNextand then selectDeployto complete the deployment.
SelectNextand then selectDeployto complete the deployment.
The deployment displays in the list for the selected region. The deployment of the configuration can take a few minutes to complete.

Note
If you're currently using peering and want to manage topology and connectivity with Azure Virtual Network Manager, you can migrate without any downtime to your network. Virtual network manager instances are fully compatible with pre-existing hub and spoke topology deployment using peering. This means that you won't need to delete any existing peered connections between the spokes and the hub as the network manager will automatically detect and manage them.

To testdirect connectivitybetween spokes, deploy a virtual machine into each spokes virtual network. Then initiate an ICMP request from one virtual machine to the other.
