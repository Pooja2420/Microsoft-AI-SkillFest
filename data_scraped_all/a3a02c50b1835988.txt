This article shows you how to quickly deploy WebLogic Server (WLS) on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) with the simplest possible set of configuration choices using the Azure portal. In this quickstart, you learn how to:
Deploy WebLogic Server with Administration Server enabled on a VM using the Azure portal.
Deploy a sample Java application with the WebLogic Server Administration Console.
Connect to the VM running WebLogic using SSH.
This article uses theAzure Marketplace Offer for WebLogic Serverto accelerate your journey to Azure. The offer automatically provisions several Azure resources, including the following resources:
Azure Virtual Machine preinstalled with your choice of OS version, Java JDK version, and WebLogic Server Version.
TLS/SSL configuration, including the easy generation of a self-signed certificate.
Virtual network (VNet), including the ability to provision into an existing VNet.
Database connection to a preexisting database.
If you prefer a less automated step-by-step approach, seeManually install WebLogic Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).
To provide feedback or work closely on your migration scenarios with the engineering team developing WebLogic on Azure solutions, fill out this shortsurvey on WebLogic migrationand include your contact information. The team of program managers, architects, and engineers will be in touch with you to initiate close collaboration.
Prerequisites
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.
Deploy WebLogic Server with Administration Server on a VM
The following steps show you how to deploy WebLogic Server on a VM using thesingle instance with an admin serveroffer on the Azure portal. There are other offers that meet different scenarios such asWebLogic cluster on multiple VMs.
In the search bar at the top of the portal, enterweblogic. In the autosuggested search results, in theMarketplacesection, selectWebLogic Server with Admin Console on VM. You can also go directly to the offer using the portal link.

In theResource groupfield, selectCreate newand fill in a value for the resource group. Because resource groups must be unique within a subscription, pick a unique name. An easy way to have unique names is to use a combination of your initials, today's date, and some identifier - for example,ejb0802wls.

Deploy a Java application from Administration Console
Use the following steps to run a sample application on the WebLogic Server:
Download a sample application as a.waror.earfile. The sample app should be self contained and not have any database, messaging, or other external connection requirements. The sample app from the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation is a good choice. You can download it fromOracle. Save the file to your local filesystem.

Connect to the virtual machine
If you want to manage the VM, you can connect to it with SSH command. Before accessing the machine, make sure you enabled port 22 for the SSH agent.
Use the following steps to enable port 22:
Navigate back to your working resource group in the Azure portal. In the overview page, you can find a network security group namedwls-nsg. Selectwls-nsg.
