As a secure service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) complies with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards. This article covers the security hardening applied to AKS based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. For more information about AKS security, seeSecurity concepts for applications and clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). For more information on the CIS benchmark, seeCenter for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks.
Kubernetes CIS benchmark
The following are the results from theCIS Kubernetes V1.27 Benchmark v1.9.0recommendations on AKS. The results are applicable to AKS 1.27.x through AKS 1.29.x,with 1.29.x reaching its end of life (EOL) in March 2025.
Security levels
CIS benchmarks provide two levels of security settings:
L1, or Level 1, recommends essential basic security requirements that can be configured on any system and should cause little or no interruption of service or reduced functionality.
L2, or Level 2, recommends security settings for environments requiring greater security that could result in some reduced functionality.
Assessment status
An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual steps to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and supported as defined below:
Automated: Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully automated and validated to a pass/fail state. Recommendations will include the necessary information to implement automation.
Manual: Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be fully automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured state is set as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment.
Automatedrecommendations affect the benchmark score if they aren't applied, whileManualrecommendations don't.
Attestation status
Recommendations can have one of the following attestation statuses:
Pass: The recommendation has been applied.
Fail: The recommendation hasn't been applied.
N/A: The recommendation relates to manifest file permission requirements that aren't relevant to AKS. Kubernetes clusters by default use a manifest model to deploy the control plane pods, which rely on files from the node VM. The CIS Kubernetes benchmark recommends these files must have certain permission requirements. AKS clusters use a Helm chart to deploy control plane pods and don't rely on files in the node VM.
Depends on Environment: The recommendation is applied in the user's specific environment and isn't controlled by AKS.Automatedrecommendations affect the benchmark score whether the recommendation applies to the user's specific environment or not.
Equivalent Control: The recommendation has been implemented in a different, equivalent manner.

Note
In addition to the Kubernetes CIS benchmark, there is anAKS CIS benchmarkavailable as well.
Additional notes
The security hardened OS is built and maintained specifically for AKS and isnotsupported outside of the AKS platform.
To further reduce the attack surface area, some unnecessary kernel module drivers are disabled in the OS.
