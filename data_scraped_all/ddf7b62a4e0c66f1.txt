Hunting bookmarks in Microsoft Sentinel helps you preserve the queries and query results that you deem relevant. You can also record your contextual observations and reference your findings by adding notes and tags. Bookmarked data is visible to you and your teammates for easy collaboration. For more information, seeBookmarks.
Important
Microsoft Sentinel is generally available within Microsoft's unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal.
Add a bookmark

Bookmarks can be optionally mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques or sub-techniques. MITRE ATT&CK mappings are inherited from mapped values in hunting queries, but you can also create them manually. Select the MITRE ATT&CK tactic associated with the desired technique from the drop-down menu in theTactics & Techniquessection of theAdd bookmarkpane. The menu expands to show all the MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and you can select multiple techniques and sub-techniques in this menu.

Now an expanded set of entities can be extracted from bookmarked query results for further investigation. In theEntity mappingsection, use the drop-downs to selectentity types and identifiers. Then map the column in the query results containing the corresponding identifier. For example:To view the bookmark in the investigation graph, you must map at least one entity. Entity mappings to account, host, IP, and URL entity types you created are supported, preserving backwards compatibility.

The log query results support bookmarks whenever this pane is opened from Microsoft Sentinel. For example, you selectGeneral>Logsfrom the navigation bar, select event links in the investigations graph, or select an alert ID from the full details of an incident. You can't create bookmarks when theLogspane is opened from other locations, such as directly from Azure Monitor.

This view shows all your bookmarks with associated metadata. You can useKusto Query Language (KQL)queries to filter down to the latest version of the specific bookmark you're looking for.
There can be a significant delay (measured in minutes) between the time you create a bookmark and when it's displayed in theBookmarkstab.
Delete a bookmark
Deleting the bookmark removes the bookmark from the list in theBookmarktab. TheHuntingBookmarktable for your Log Analytics workspace continues to contain previous bookmark entries, but the latest entry changes theSoftDeletevalue to true, making it easy to filter out old bookmarks. Deleting a bookmark doesn't remove any entities from the investigation experience that are associated with other bookmarks or alerts.
To delete a bookmark, complete the following steps.
From theHunting>Bookmarkstab, select the bookmark or bookmarks you want to delete.
From theHunting>Bookmarkstab, select the bookmark or bookmarks you want to delete.
