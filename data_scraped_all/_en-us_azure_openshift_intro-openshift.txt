The MicrosoftAzure Red Hat OpenShiftservice enables you to deploy fully managedOpenShiftclusters. Azure Red Hat OpenShift extendsKubernetes. Running containers in production with Kubernetes requires other tools and resources. This often includes the need to coordinate image registries, storage management, networking solutions, and logging and monitoring tools that must be versioned and tested together. Building container-based applications requires even more integration work with middleware, frameworks, databases, and CI/CD tools. Azure Red Hat OpenShift combines all those items into a single platform, bringing ease of operations to IT teams while giving application teams what they need to execute.
Azure Red Hat OpenShift is jointly engineered, operated, and supported by Red Hat and Microsoft to provide an integrated support experience. There are no virtual machines to operate, and no patching is required. Control plane, infrastructure, and application nodes are patched, updated, and monitored on your behalf by Red Hat and Microsoft. Your Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters are deployed into your Azure subscription and are included on your Azure bill.
You can choose your own registry, networking, storage, and CI/CD solutions, or use the built-in solutions for automated source code management, container and application builds, deployments, scaling, health management, and more. Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides an integrated sign-on experience through Microsoft Entra ID.
Access, security, and monitoring
For improved security and management, Azure Red Hat OpenShift lets you integrate with Microsoft Entra ID and use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC). You can also monitor the health of your cluster and resources.
Cluster and node
Azure Red Hat OpenShift nodes run on Azure virtual machines. You can connect storage to nodes and pods and upgrade cluster components.
Service Level Agreement
Azure Red Hat OpenShift offers a Service Level Agreement to guarantee that the service is available 99.95% of the time. For more information about the SLA, seeAzure Red Hat OpenShift SLA.
