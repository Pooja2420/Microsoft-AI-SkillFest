Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) manages access and operations of Azure resources.
To deploy a private endpoint or private link service a user must have assigned a built-in role such as:
Owner
Contributor
Network contributor
You can provide more granular access by creating acustom rolewith the permissions described in the following sections.
Important
This article lists the specific permissions to create a private endpoint or private link service. Ensure you add the specific permissions related to the service you would like to grant access through private link, such as Microsoft.SQL Contributor Role for Azure SQL. For more information about built-in roles, seeRole Based Access Control.
Microsoft.Network and the specific resource provider you are deploying, for example Microsoft.Sql, must be registered at the subscription level:

Approval RBAC for private endpoint
Typically, a network administrator creates a private endpoint. Depending on your Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, a private endpoint that you create is eitherautomatically approvedto send traffic to the API Management instance, or requires the resource owner tomanually approvethe connection.
