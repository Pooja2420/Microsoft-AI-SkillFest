Moodle deployment with Azure NetApp Files
Moodle is an open-source learning management system that requires high-throughput, low-latency access to storage. Many Moodle deployments require easy scalability to adapt to growing demand. This article explains how you can deploy Moodle by using Azure services on Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets and store user-accessible learning data files in Azure NetApp Files. This article describes a zonal deployment for high availability and cross-zone replication and also gives examples of a single-zone deployment.
Architecture
For the best user experience, Moodle requires consistent low-latency access to scalable shared storage to meet the demands of office and home workers who use the service. Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure NetApp Files capacity pools and volumes can be sized up and down as the demand changes.

A diagram that illustrates the single-region Azure NetApp Files Moodle deployment. Inside of the same Azure region box, there's a second zone that includes disaster recovery versions of Azure NetApp Files. The Azure Traffic Manager routes students to the application in zone one or zone two.

In addition to the Moodle deployment, the architecture uses Azure NetApp Files cross-zone replication to replicate the data volumes to a secondary zone.Cross-zone replicationuses availability zones to provide high availability in a region and replication to a different zone in the same region. A capacity pool that uses the Standard service level can host the destination data volumes during normal operation.
By using this approach, you don't need to start some components of the setup, like compute and ancillary services, during normal operation. As a result, you won't incur any operational cost for these components. You can also scale down the virtual machine scale sets to the minimum.
Only in a disaster recovery scenario should you start and scale up the necessary components to continue the service using the replicated data volumes. At this time, you can upgrade the service level of the destination Azure NetApp Files volumes to the Premium or Ultra service level if necessary.
After you recover the primary zone, the replication direction is reversed. The primary zone is updated with the changes that are applied during the failover, and the service can be failed back. Users are redirected to the failover zone throughAzure Traffic Manager, which operates at the DNS layer to quickly and efficiently direct incoming DNS requests based on the routing method of your choice.
Workflow
Students access the Moodle application data through an Azure Application Gateway where they can use Virtual Machine Scale Sets to build a scalable compute platform that runs the Moodle app to host users. Azure NetApp Files serves the content data to the Moodle app. Use a Redis cache for user session caching, locking, and key awareness. Store the learning content, student progress, and internal data in a MySQL database.
Insert learning content through a secure VPN gateway directly from the customer datacenter.

You can scale the solution up or down depending on demand by adding or removing virtual machines (VMs) in the scale set and adjusting theAzure NetApp Files volume service level.

Alternatives
You can deploy the Moodle service by using any NFS-based shared file service that meets your requirements for low latency, high input or output operations per second, and throughput, especially for higher numbers of concurrent users. You can use an NFS service built on top of a set of Linux VMs, but this configuration can cause manageability, scalability, and performance challenges. Azure NetApp Files provides the lowest latency, best performance and scalability, and secure access to NFS shared storage.
This diagram captures an example of a single-region deployment:

A rectangle denotes an Azure region that contains a virtual network. The virtual network has three smaller rectangles inside of it. Two rectangles are stacked and one is on the right side. The top rectangle denotes a network security group the Moodle, a PHP application, an HTTP server, and a Redis cache that's connected to the third rectangle, which contains the MySQL database. The network security group also includes a DNS router that's connected to an application gateway for Virtual Machine Scale Sets, which is attached to the other rectangle that represents the Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet. That rectangle contains three volumes and related snapshots. Students access the Moodle application through the DNS, and the Azure VPN gateway securely connects the resources to the customer datacenter.

This single-region setup provides highly available access to the Moodle application and other components of the configuration.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Azure NetApp Files is built on a bare-metal fleet of redundant, solid-state hardware. The service operates without interruption, even during maintenance operations. For more information about resiliency, seeFault Tolerance, High Availability, and Resiliency in Azure NetApp Files.
Azure NetApp Files provides high availability for your stored data. For the Azure NetApp Files availability guarantee, seeSLA for Azure NetApp Files.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
For all deployment options, you need to provide a valid Secure Shell (SSH) protocol 2 (SSH-2) RSA publicâprivate key pair. The length should be at least 2,048 bits. Azure doesn't support other key formats such as ED25519 and ECDSA. Azure NetApp Files supports both customer-managed and platform-managed keys. These solutions provide unrestricted access to stored data, meet compliance requirements, and enhance data security. For information and best practices about Azure NetApp Files security, seeSecurity FAQs for Azure NetApp Files.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
For a medium-to-large-sized Moodle deployment of approximately 5,000 users with a 10% concurrency ratio, the recommended throughput is approximately 500 MB/s. This deployment can be built on a Linux-based Standard_D32s_v4 VM infrastructure that uses 8 TB of a P60-managed disk.
Azure NetApp Files provides a more cost-effective solution that uses 4 TiB of Ultra-service level capacity. For larger-scale applications that require more Azure NetApp Files capacity, both the Premium and Standard service levels provide sufficient performance. Use the Premium or Standard service level to improve cost effectiveness.
