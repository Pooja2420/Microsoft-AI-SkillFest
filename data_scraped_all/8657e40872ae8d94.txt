This article describes how to create older classic metric alerts. Azure Monitor now supportsnewer near-real time metric alerts and a new alerts experience. Classic alerts areretiredfor public cloud users. Classic alerts for Azure Government cloud and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet will retire on29 February 2024.
Classic metric alerts in Azure Monitor provide a way to get notified when one of your metrics crosses a threshold. Classic metric alerts is an older functionality that allows for alerting only on non-dimensional metrics. There's an existing newer functionality called Metric alerts, which has improved functionality over classic metric alerts. You can learn more about the new metric alerts functionality inmetric alerts overview. In this article, we'll describe how to create, view and manage classic metric alert rules through Azure portal and PowerShell.
With Azure portal
In theportal, locate the resource that you want to monitor, and then select it.

In theMONITORINGsection, selectAlerts (Classic). The text and icon might vary slightly for different resources. If you don't findAlerts (Classic)here, you might find it inAlertsorAlert Rules.

Nameyour alert rule. Then choose aDescription, which also appears in notification emails.

Select theMetricthat you want to monitor. Then choose aConditionandThresholdvalue for the metric. Also choose thePeriodof time that the metric rule must be satisfied before the alert triggers. For example, if you use the period "Over the last 5 minutes" and your alert looks for a CPU above 80%, the alert triggers when the CPU has been consistently above 80% for 5 minutes. After the first trigger occurs, it triggers again when the CPU stays below 80% for 5 minutes. The CPU metric measurement happens every minute.

If you want to send notifications to additional email addresses when the alert fires, add them in theAdditional Administrator email(s)field. Separate multiple emails with semicolons, in the following format:email@contoso.com;email2@contoso.com

Within a few minutes, the alert is active and triggers as previously described.
After you create an alert, you can select it and do one of the following tasks:
View a graph that shows the metric threshold and the actual values from the previous day.
Edit or delete it.
DisableorEnableit if you want to temporarily stop or resume receiving notifications for that alert.
With PowerShell
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. SeeInstall Azure PowerShellto get started. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
This section shows how to use PowerShell commands create, view and manage classic metric alerts.The examples in the article illustrate how you can use Azure Monitor cmdlets for classic metric alerts.
If you haven't already, set up PowerShell to run on your computer. For more information, seeHow to Install and Configure PowerShell. You can also review the entire list of Azure Monitor PowerShell cmdlets atAzure Monitor (Insights) Cmdlets.

You can retrieve all classic metric alert rules on a resource group:Get-AzAlertRule -ResourceGroup montest
You can retrieve all classic metric alert rules on a resource group:
Get-AzAlertRule -ResourceGroup montest

You can view details of a classic metric alert rule

Get-AzAlertRule -Name simpletestCPU -ResourceGroup montest -DetailedOutput
You can retrieve all alert rules set for a target resource. For example, all alert rules set on a VM.Get-AzAlertRule -ResourceGroup montest -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/montest/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testconfig

Classic alert rules can no longer be created via PowerShell. Use the new'Add-AzMetricAlertRuleV2'command to create a metric alert rule instead.

Next steps
Create a classic metric alert with a Resource Manager template.
Have a classic metric alert notify a non-Azure system using a webhook.
