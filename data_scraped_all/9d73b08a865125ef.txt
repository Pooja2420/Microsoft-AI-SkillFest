This article shows you how to set up an alert for new recommendations from Azure Advisor by using the Azure portal.
Whenever Advisor detects a new recommendation for one of your resources, an event is stored in theAzure activity log. You can set up alerts for these events from Advisor by using a recommendation-specific alerts creation experience. You can select a subscription and optionally a resource group to specify the resources that you want to receive alerts on.
You can also determine the types of recommendations by using these properties:
Category
Impact level
Recommendation type
You can also configure the action that takes place when an alert is triggered by:
Selecting an existing action group.
Creating a new action group.
To learn more about action groups, seeCreate and manage action groups.
Note
Advisor alerts are currently only available for High Availability, Performance, and Cost recommendations. Security recommendations aren't supported.

Configure recommendation alerts to use a webhook
This section shows you how to configure Advisor alerts to send recommendation data through webhooks to your existing systems.
You can set up alerts to be notified when you have a new Advisor recommendation on one of your resources. These alerts can notify you through email or text message. They can also be used to integrate with your existing systems through a webhook.
Use the Advisor recommendation alert payload
If you want to integrate Advisor alerts into your own systems by using a webhook, you need to parse the JSON payload that's sent from the notification.
When you set up your action group for this alert, you select if you want to use the common alert schema. If you select the common alert schema, your payload looks like this example:
