This guide describes how to migrate Virtual Machines (VMs) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets from non-availability zone support to availability zone support. We take you through the different options for migration, including how you can use availability zone support for Disaster Recovery solutions.
Virtual Machine (VM) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets are availability zone enabled services, which means that VM resources can be deployed by using one of the following methods:
Zonal: VM resources are deployed to a specific, self-selected availability zone to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements.
Zonal: VM resources are deployed to a specific, self-selected availability zone to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements.
Zone-redundant: VM resources are replicated to one or more zones within the region to improve the resiliency of the application and data in a High Availability (HA) architecture.
Zone-redundant: VM resources are replicated to one or more zones within the region to improve the resiliency of the application and data in a High Availability (HA) architecture.
To ensure high-availability of your compute resources, we recommend that you select multiple zones for your new VMs and Virtual Machine Scale Sets when you migrate to availability zones.
For more information on availability zone support for VM services, seeReliability in Virtual Machines. For availability zone support for Virtual Machine scale sets, seeReliability in Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
Prerequisites
To migrate to availability zone support, your VM SKUs must be available across the zones in for your region. To check for VM SKU availability, use one of the following methods:
Use PowerShell toCheck VM SKU availability.
Use the Azure CLI toCheck VM SKU availability.
Go toAzure services with availability zone support.
Downtime requirements
Because zonal VMs are created across the availability zones, all migration options mentioned in this article require downtime during deployment.
Migration Option 1: Redeployment
When to use redeployment
Use the redeployment option if you have set up good Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices to manage infrastructure. This redeployment option gives you more control and the ability to automate various processes within your deployment pipelines.
Redeployment considerations
When you redeploy your VM and Virtual Machine Scale Sets resources, the underlying resources such as managed disk and IP address for the VM are created in the same availability zone. You must use a Standard SKU public IP address and load balancer to create zone-redundant network resources.

Existing managed disks without availability zone support can't be attached to a VM with availability zone support. To attach existing managed disks to a VM with availability zone support, you need to take a snapshot of the current disks, and then create your VM with the new managed disks attached.

For zonal deployments that require reasonably low network latency and good performance between application tier and data tier, useproximity placement groups. Proximity groups can force grouping of different VM resources under a single network spine. For an example of an SAP workload that uses proximity placement groups, seeAzure proximity placement groups for optimal network latency with SAP applications

How to redeploy
If you want to migrate the data on your current managed disks when creating a new VM, follow the directions inMigrate your managed disks.
If you only want to create new VM with new managed disks in an availability zone, see:
Create VM using Azure CLI
Create VM using Azure PowerShell
Create VM using Azure portal
To learn how to create Virtual Machine Scale Sets in an availability zone, seeCreate a virtual machine scale set that uses Availability Zones.
Migrate your managed disks
In this section, you migrate the data from your current managed disks to either zone-redundant storage (ZRS) managed disks or zonal managed disks.
The easiest and cleanest way to create a snapshot is to do so while the VM is offline. SeeSnapshots. If you choose this approach, some downtime should be expected. To create a snapshot of your VM using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI, seeCreate a snapshot of a virtual hard disk
If you're taking a snapshot of a disk that's attached to a running VM, read the guidance inSnapshotsbefore proceeding.
Note
The source managed disks remain intact with their current configurations and you'll continue to be billed for them. To avoid this, you must manually delete the disks once you've finished your migration and confirmed the new disks are working. For more information, seeFind and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks.
Now that you have snapshots of your original disks, you can use them to create either ZRS managed disks or zonal managed disks.
To migrate a non-zonal managed disk to zonal:
Create a zonal managed disk from the source disk snapshot. The zone parameter should match your zonal VM.  To create a zonal managed disk from the snapshot, you can useAzure CLI(example below),PowerShell, or the Azure portal.az disk create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $diskName --location $location --zone $zone --sku $storageType --size-gb $diskSize --source $snapshotId
Create a zonal managed disk from the source disk snapshot. The zone parameter should match your zonal VM.  To create a zonal managed disk from the snapshot, you can useAzure CLI(example below),PowerShell, or the Azure portal.
az disk create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $diskName --location $location --zone $zone --sku $storageType --size-gb $diskSize --source $snapshotId
az disk create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $diskName --location $location --zone $zone --sku $storageType --size-gb $diskSize --source $snapshotId
Important
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) for managed disks has some restrictions. For more information, seeLimitations.
Create a ZRS managed disk from the source disk snapshot by using the following Azure CLI snippet:# Create a new ZRS Managed Disks using the snapshot Id and the SKU supported   
storageType=Premium_ZRS 
location=westus2 

az disk create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $diskName --sku $storageType --size-gb $diskSize --source $snapshotId
Create a ZRS managed disk from the source disk snapshot by using the following Azure CLI snippet:
# Create a new ZRS Managed Disks using the snapshot Id and the SKU supported   
storageType=Premium_ZRS 
location=westus2 

az disk create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $diskName --sku $storageType --size-gb $diskSize --source $snapshotId
# Create a new ZRS Managed Disks using the snapshot Id and the SKU supported   
storageType=Premium_ZRS 
location=westus2 

az disk create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $diskName --sku $storageType --size-gb $diskSize --source $snapshotId
Now that you have migrated your data to ZRS managed disks or zonal managed disks, create a new VM with these new disks set as the OS and data disks:
az vm create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm --attach-os-disk newZonalOSDiskCopy --attach-data-disks newZonalDataDiskCopy --os-type linux
az vm create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm --attach-os-disk newZonalOSDiskCopy --attach-data-disks newZonalDataDiskCopy --os-type linux
Migration Option 2: VM regional to zonal move
This section details how to move single instance Azure virtual machines from a Regional configuration to a targetAvailability Zonewithin the same Azure region.
Key benefits of regional to zonal move
The benefits of a regional to zonal move are:
Enhanced user experience- The new availability zones in the desired region lowers the latency and builds a good customer experience.
Reduced downtime- The virtual machines are supported throughout, thereby improving the application resiliency and availability.
Network connectivityâ Leverages the existing infrastructure, such as virtual networks (VNETs), subnets, network security groups (NSGs), and load balancers (LBs), which can support the target Zonal configuration.
High scalability- Orchestrates the move at scale by reducing manual touch points and minimizes the overall migration time from days to hours or even minutes, depending on the volume of data.
Components
The following components are used during a regional to zonal move:

How to move a VM from regional to zonal configuration
Before moving a VM from regional to zonal configuration, seeFAQ - Move Azure single instance VM from regional to zonal.
To learn how to move VMs from regional to zonal configuration within same region in the Azure portal, seeMove Azure single instance VMs from regional to zonal configuration.
To learn how to do the same using Azure PowerShell and CLI, seeMove a VM in an availability zone using Azure PowerShell and CLI.
Migration Option 3: Azure Resource Mover
When to use Azure Resource Mover
Use Azure Resource Mover for an easy way to move VMs or encrypted VMs from one region without availability zones to another with availability zone support. If you want to learn more about the benefits of using Azure Resource Mover, seeWhy use Azure Resource Mover?.
Azure Resource Mover considerations
When you use Azure Resource mover, all keys and secrets are copied from the source key vault to the newly created destination key vault in your target region. All resources related to your customer-managed keys, such as Azure Key Vaults, disk encryption sets, VMs, disks, and snapshots, must be in the same subscription and region. Azure Key Vaultâs default availability and redundancy feature can't be used as the destination key vault for the moved VM resources, even if the target region is a secondary region to which your source key vault is replicated.

Disaster Recovery Considerations
Typically, availability zones are used to deploy VMs in a High Availability configuration. They may be too close to each other to serve as a Disaster Recovery solution during a natural disaster.  However, there are scenarios where availability zones can be used for Disaster Recovery. To learn more, seeUsing Availability Zones for Disaster Recovery.
The following requirements should be part of a disaster recovery strategy that helps your organization run its workloads during planned or unplanned outages across zones:
The source VM must already be a zonal VM, which means that it's placed in a logical zone.
You need to replicate your VM from one zone to another zone using Azure Site Recovery service.
Once your VM is replicated to another zone, you can follow steps to run a Disaster Recovery drill, fail over, reprotect, and failback.
To enable VM disaster recovery between availability zones, follow the instructions inEnable Azure VM disaster recovery between availability zones.
