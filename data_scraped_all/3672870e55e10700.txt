You can create an AzureAutomation accountusing the Azure portal, a browser-based user interface allowing access to a number of resources. One Automation account can manage resources across all regions and subscriptions for a given tenant. This Quickstart guides you in creating an Automation account.

Options for your new Automation account are organized into tabs in theCreate an Automation Accountpage. The following sections describe each of the tabs and their options.
Basics
On theBasicstab, provide the essential information for your Automation account. After you complete theBasicstab, you can choose to further customize your new Automation account by setting options on the other tabs, or you can selectReview + createto accept the default options and proceed to validate and create the account.
Note
By default, a system-assigned managed identity is enabled for the Automation account.
The following table describes the fields on theBasicstab.
The following image shows a standard configuration for a new Automation account.

Advanced
On theAdvancedtab, you can configure the managed identity option for your new Automation account. The user-assigned managed identity option can also be configured after the Automation account is created.
For instructions on how to create a user-assigned managed identity, seeCreate a user-assigned managed identity.
The following table describes the fields on theAdvancedtab.
You can choose to enable managed identities later, and the Automation account is created without one. To enable a managed identity after the account is created, seeEnable managed identity. If you select both options, for the user-assigned identity, select theAdd user assigned identitiesoption. On theSelect user assigned managed identitypage, select a subscription and add one or more user-assigned identities created in that subscription to assign to the Automation account.

Networking
On theNetworkingtab, you can connect to your automation account either publicly (via public IP addresses), or privately, using a private endpoint. The following image shows the connectivity configuration that you can define for a new automation account.
Public Accessâ This default option provides a public endpoint for the Automation account that can receive traffic over the internet and does not require any additional configuration. However, we don't recommend it for private applications or secure environments. Instead, the second optionPrivate access, a private Link mentioned below can be leveraged to restrict access to automation endpoints only from authorized virtual networks. Public access can simultaneously coexist with the private endpoint enabled on the Automation account. If you select public access while creating the Automation account, you can add a Private endpoint later from the Networking blade of the Automation Account.

Private Accessâ This option provides a private endpoint for the Automation account that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to the Automation account. You bring the service into your virtual network by enabling a private endpoint. This is the recommended configuration from a security point of view; however, this requires you to configure Hybrid Runbook Worker connected to an Azure virtual network & currently does not support cloud jobs.

Tags
On theTagstab, you can specify Resource Manager tags to help organize your Azure resources. For more information, seeTag resources, resource groups, and subscriptions for logical organization.
Review + create tab
When you navigate to theReview + createtab, Azure runs validation on the Automation account settings that you have chosen. If validation passes, you can proceed to create the Automation account.
If validation fails, then the portal indicates which settings need to be modified.
Review your new Automation account.

Clean up resources
If you're not going to continue to use the Automation account, selectDeletefrom theOverviewpage, and then selectYeswhen prompted.
