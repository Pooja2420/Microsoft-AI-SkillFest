Applies to: Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal, Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal
In this article
As part of your security investigations and hunting, launch and run Jupyter notebooks to programmatically analyze your data.
In this article, you create an Azure Machine Learning  workspace, launch notebook from Microsoft Sentinel to your Azure Machine Learning workspace, and run code in the notebook.
Important
Microsoft Sentinel is generally available within Microsoft's unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. For more information, seeMicrosoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal.

Prerequisites
We recommend that you learn about Microsoft Sentinel notebooks before completing the steps in this article. SeeUse Jupyter notebooks to hunt for security threats.
To use Microsoft Sentinel notebooks, you must have the following roles and permissions:
Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace from Microsoft Sentinel
To create your workspace, select one of the following tabs, depending on whether you're using a public or private endpoint.
We recommend that you use apublic endpointwhen your Microsoft Sentinel workspace has one, to avoid potential issues in the network communication.
If you want to use an Azure Machine Learning workspace in a virtual network, use aprivate endpoint.

After your deployment is complete, go back toNotebooksin Microsoft Sentinel and launch notebooks from your new Azure Machine Learning workspace.
If you have multiple notebooks, make sure to select a default AML workspace to use when launching your notebooks. For example:

Launch a notebook in your Azure Machine Learning workspace
After you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, launch your notebook in that workspace from Microsoft Sentinel. Be aware that if you have private endpoints or restrictions on the public network access enabled in your Azure storage account, you can't launch notebooks in the Azure Machine Learning workspace from Microsoft Sentinel. You must copy the notebook template from Microsoft Sentinel and upload the notebook to the Azure Machine Learning studio.
To launch your Microsoft Sentinel notebook in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, complete the following steps.
For Microsoft Sentinel in theAzure portal, underThreat management, selectNotebooks.For Microsoft Sentinel in theDefender portal, selectMicrosoft Sentinel>Threat management>Notebooks.

If your notebook hangs or you want to start over, you can restart the kernel and rerun the notebook cells from the beginning. If you restart the kernel, variables and other state are deleted. Rerun any initialization and authentication cells after you restart.To start over, selectKernel operations>Restart kernel. For example:

Run code in your notebook
Always run notebook code cells in sequence. Skipping cells can result in errors.
In a notebook:
Markdowncells have text, including HTML, and static images.
Codecells contain code. After you select a code cell, run the code in the cell by selecting thePlayicon to the left of the cell, or by pressingSHIFT+ENTER.
For example, run the following code cell in your notebook:
# This is your first code cell. This cell contains basic Python code.

# You can run a code cell by selecting it and then selecting
# the Play button to the left of the cell, or by pressing SHIFT+ENTER.
# Code output displays below the code.

print("Congratulations, you just ran this code cell")

y = 2 + 2

print("2 + 2 =", y)
# This is your first code cell. This cell contains basic Python code.

# You can run a code cell by selecting it and then selecting
# the Play button to the left of the cell, or by pressing SHIFT+ENTER.
# Code output displays below the code.

print("Congratulations, you just ran this code cell")

y = 2 + 2

print("2 + 2 =", y)
The sample code produces this output:
Congratulations, you just ran this code cell

2 + 2 = 4
Congratulations, you just ran this code cell

2 + 2 = 4
Variables set within a notebook code cell persist between cells, so you can chain cells together. For example, the following code cell uses the value ofyfrom the previous cell:
y
# Note that output from the last line of a cell is automatically
# sent to the output cell, without needing the print() function.

y + 2
# Note that output from the last line of a cell is automatically
# sent to the output cell, without needing the print() function.

y + 2
The output is:

Download all Microsoft Sentinel notebooks
This section describes how to use Git to download all the notebooks available in theMicrosoft Sentinel GitHub repository, from inside a Microsoft Sentinel notebook, directly to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
Storing the Microsoft Sentinel notebooks in your Azure Machine Learning workspace allows you to keep them updated easily.
From a Microsoft Sentinel notebook, enter the following code into an empty cell, and then run the cell:!git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks.git azure-sentinel-nbA copy of the GitHub repository contents is created in theazure-Sentinel-nbdirectory on your user folder in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
From a Microsoft Sentinel notebook, enter the following code into an empty cell, and then run the cell:
!git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks.git azure-sentinel-nb
!git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks.git azure-sentinel-nb
A copy of the GitHub repository contents is created in theazure-Sentinel-nbdirectory on your user folder in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
Copy the notebooks you want from this folder to your working directory.
