This article describes how to manage a capacity pool that uses the manual QoS type.
SeeStorage hierarchy of Azure NetApp FilesandPerformance considerations for Azure NetApp Filesto understand the considerations about QoS types.
Set up a new manual QoS capacity pool
To create a new capacity pool using the manual QoS type:
Follow steps inCreate a capacity pool.
Follow steps inCreate a capacity pool.
In the New Capacity Pool window, select theManual QoStype.
In the New Capacity Pool window, select theManual QoStype.
Change a capacity pool to use manual QoS
You can change a capacity pool that currently uses the auto QoS type to use the manual QoS type.
Important
Setting the capacity type to manual QoS is a permanent change. You cannot convert a manual QoS type capacity tool to an auto QoS capacity pool.At conversion time, throughput levels might be capped to conform to the throughput limits for volumes of the manual QoS type. SeeResource limits for Azure NetApp Files.
From the management blade for your NetApp account, selectCapacity poolsto display existing capacity pools.

Select the capacity pool that you want to change to using manual QoS.
Select the capacity pool that you want to change to using manual QoS.
SelectChange QoS type. Then setNew QoS TypetoManual. SelectOK.

Monitor the throughput of a manual QoS capacity pool
Metrics are available to help you monitor the read and write throughput of a volume. SeeMetrics for Azure NetApp Files.
Modify the allotted throughput of a manual QoS volume
If a volume is contained in a manual QoS capacity pool, you can modify the allotted volume throughput as needed.
From theVolumespage, select the volume whose throughput you want to modify.
From theVolumespage, select the volume whose throughput you want to modify.
SelectChange throughput. Specify theThroughput (MiB/S)that you want. SelectOK.
SelectChange throughput. Specify theThroughput (MiB/S)that you want. SelectOK.

Modify the throughput of a Flexible service level capacity pool
With the Flexible service level, you can adjust the throughput of the capacity pool as needed. You can increase the throughput of a Flexible service level pool at any time. Decreases to throughput on Flexible service level capacity pools can only occur following a 24-hour cool-down period. The 24-hour cool-down period initiates after any change to the throughput of the Flexible service level capacity pool.
From your NetApp account, selectCapacity poolsto display existing capacity pools.

Right-click the capacity pool whose throughput you want to modify then selectChange throughput.
Right-click the capacity pool whose throughput you want to modify then selectChange throughput.
Enter a value between 128 and 2560 MiB/s.
Enter a value between 128 and 2560 MiB/s.
