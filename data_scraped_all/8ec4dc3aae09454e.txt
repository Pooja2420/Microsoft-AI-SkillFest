Note
When using proximity placement groups on AKS, colocation only applies to the agent nodes. Node to node and the corresponding hosted pod to pod latency is improved. The colocation doesn't affect the placement of a cluster's control plane.
When deploying your application in Azure, you can create network latency by spreading virtual machine (VM) instances across regions or availability zones, which may impact the overall performance of your application. A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure Azure compute resources are physically located close to one another. Some applications, such as gaming, engineering simulations, and high-frequency trading (HFT) require low latency and tasks that can complete quickly. For similar high-performance computing (HPC) scenarios, consider usingproximity placement groups (PPG)for your cluster's node pools.
Before you begin
This article requires Azure CLI version 2.14 or later. Runaz --versionto find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure CLI.
az --version
Limitations
A proximity placement group can map to onlyoneavailability zone.
A node pool must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets to associate a proximity placement group.
A node pool can associate a proximity placement group at node pool create time only.
Node pools and proximity placement groups
The first resource you deploy with a proximity placement group attaches to a specific data center. Any extra resources you deploy with the same proximity placement group are colocated in the same data center. Once all resources using the proximity placement group are stopped (deallocated) or deleted, it's no longer attached.
You can associate multiple node pools with a single proximity placement group.
You can only associate a node pool with a single proximity placement group.
Configure proximity placement groups with availability zones
Note
While proximity placement groups require a node pool to use onlyoneavailability zone, thebaseline Azure VM SLA of 99.9%is still in effect for VMs in a single zone.
Proximity placement groups are a node pool concept and associated with each individual node pool. Using a PPG resource has no impact on AKS control plane availability, which can impact how you should design your cluster with zones. To ensure a cluster is spread across multiple zones, we recommend using the following design:
Provision a cluster with the first system pool usingthreezones and no proximity placement group associated to ensure the system pods land in a dedicated node pool, which spreads across multiple zones.
Add extra user node pools with a unique zone and proximity placement group associated to each pool. An example isnodepool1in zone one and PPG1,nodepool2in zone two and PPG2, andnodepool3in zone 3 with PPG3. This configuration ensures that, at a cluster level, nodes are spread across multiple zones and each individual node pool is colocated in the designated zone with a dedicated PPG resource.
Create a new AKS cluster with a proximity placement group
Accelerated networking greatly improves networking performance of virtual machines. Ideally, use proximity placement groups with accelerated networking. By default, AKS uses accelerated networking onsupported virtual machine instances, which include most Azure virtual machine with two or more vCPUs.

Add a proximity placement group to an existing cluster
You can add a proximity placement group to an existing cluster by creating a new node pool. You can then optionally migrate existing workloads to the new node pool and delete the original node pool.
Use the same proximity placement group that you created earlier to ensure agent nodes in both node pools in your AKS cluster are physically located in the same data center.
Create a new node pool using theaz aks nodepool addcommand and replace themyPPGResourceIDvalue with your proximity placement group resource ID.az aks nodepool add \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --cluster-name myAKSCluster \
    --name mynodepool \
    --node-count 1 \
    --ppg myPPGResourceID
