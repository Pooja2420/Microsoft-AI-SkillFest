TheApp Service Environmentis a deployment of Azure App Service in the subnet of a customer's Azure virtual network. It can be deployed with an external or internal endpoint for app access. The deployment of the App Service Environment with an internal endpoint is called an internal load balancer (ILB) App Service Environment.
Web application firewalls help secure your web applications by inspecting inbound web traffic to block SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, malware uploads & application DDoS and other attacks. You can get a WAF device from Azure Marketplace or you can use theAzure Application Gateway.
The Azure Application Gateway is a virtual appliance that provides layer 7 load balancing, TLS offloading, and web application firewall (WAF) protection. It can listen on a public IP address and route traffic to your application endpoint. The following information describes how to integrate a WAF-configured application gateway with an app in an ILB App Service Environment.
The integration of the application gateway with the ILB App Service Environment is at an app level. When you configure the application gateway with your ILB App Service Environment, you're doing it for specific apps in your ILB App Service Environment.

In this walkthrough, you will:
Create an Azure Application Gateway.
Configure the application gateway to point to an app in your ILB App Service Environment.
Edit the public DNS host name that points to your application gateway.
Prerequisites
To integrate your application gateway with your ILB App Service Environment, you need:
An ILB App Service Environment.
A private DNS zone for ILB App Service Environment.
An app running in the ILB App Service Environment.
A public DNS name for your application gateway.
If you need to use TLS encryption to the application gateway, a valid public certificate that's used to bind to your application gateway is required.
ILB App Service Environment
For details on how to create an ILB App Service Environment, seeCreate an App Service Environment in the Azure portalandCreate an App Service Environment with Azure Resource Manager template.
After ILB App Service Environment is created, the default domain is<YourAseName>.appserviceenvironment.net.
After ILB App Service Environment is created, the default domain is<YourAseName>.appserviceenvironment.net.
<YourAseName>.appserviceenvironment.net

An internal load balancer is provisioned for inbound access. You can check the Inbound address in the IP addresses under App Service Environment Settings. You can create a private DNS zone mapped to this IP address later.

A private DNS zone
You need aprivate DNS zonefor internal name resolution. Create it using the App Service Environment name using the record sets shown in the following table (for instructions, seeQuickstart - Create an Azure private DNS zone using the Azure portal).
App Service on ILB App Service Environment
You need to create an App Service plan and an app in your ILB App Service Environment. When creating the app in the portal, select your ILB App Service Environment as theRegion.
A public DNS name to the application gateway
To connect to the application gateway from internet, you need a routable domain name. In this case, I used a routable domain nameasabuludemo.comand planning to connect to an App Service with this domain nameapp.asabuludemo.com. The IP address mapped to this app domain name needs to be set to the Application Gateway Public IP address after the application gateway is created.
With a public domain mapped to the application gateway, you don't need to configure a custom domain in App Service. You can buy a custom domain name withApp Service Domains.
asabuludemo.com
app.asabuludemo.com
A valid public certificate
For security enhancement, bind a TLS certificate for session encryption. To bind TLS certificate to the application gateway, a valid public certificate with following information is required. WithApp Service certificates, you can buy a TLS certificate and export it in.pfxformat.
.pfx
<yourappname>.<yourdomainname>
app.asabuludemo.com
*.<yourdomainname>
*.asabuludemo.com
<yourappname>.scm.<yourdomainname>
app.scm.asabuludemo.com
*.scm.<yourdomainname>
*.scm.asabuludemo.com
The certificate file should have a private key and save in.pfxformat. The certificate is imported to the application gateway later.
.pfx
Create an application gateway
For the basic application gateway creation, refer toTutorial: Create an application gateway with a Web Application Firewall using the Azure portal.
In this tutorial, we use Azure portal to create an application gateway with ILB App Service Environment.
In the Azure portal, selectNew>Network>Application Gatewayto create an application gateway.

Frontends settingSelect Frontend IP address type toPublic,PrivateorBoth. If you set toPrivateorBoth, you need to assign a static IP address in the application gateway subnet range. In this case, we set to Public IP for public endpoint only.Public IP address - You need to associate a public IP address for the application gateway public access. Record this IP address, you need to add a record in your DNS service later.

Configure an application gateway integration with ILB App Service Environment
To access ILB App Service Environment from the application gateway, you need to check if a virtual network link to private DNS zone. If there's no virtual network linked to your application gateway's virtual network, add a virtual network link with following steps.
Configure virtual network links with a private DNS zone
To configure virtual network link with private DNS zone, go to the private DNS zone configuration plane. Select theVirtual network links>Add

Input theLink nameand select the respective subscription and virtual network where the application gateway resides in.

You can confirm the backend health status fromBackend healthin the application gateway plane.

Add a public DNS record
You need to configure a proper DNS mapping when access to the application gateway from internet.
The public IP address of the application gateway can be found inFrontend IP configurationsin the application gateway plane.

Use Azure DNS service as example, you can add a record set to map the app domain name to the public IP address of the application gateway.

Validate connection
On a machine access from internet, you can verify the name resolution for the app domain name to the application gateway public IP address.

On a machine access from internet, test the web access from a browser.
