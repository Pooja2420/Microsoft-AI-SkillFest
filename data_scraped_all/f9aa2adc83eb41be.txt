You can enable the SMB Continuous Availability (CA) feature when youcreate a new SMB volume. You can also enable SMB CA on an existing SMB volume; this article shows you how to do so.
Important
Custom applications are not supported with SMB Continuous Availability.
For more information, seeEnable Continuous Availability.
You should enable Continuous Availability for the following workloads/use cases only:
Citrix App Layering
FSLogix user profile containers, includingFSLogix ODFC containers
MSIX app attach with Azure Virtual DesktopWhen using MSIX applications with theCIM FSfile format:The number of AVD session hosts per volume shouldn't exceed 500.The number of MSIX applications per volume shouldn't exceed 40.When using MSIX applications with theVHDXfile format:The number of AVD session hosts per volume shouldn't exceed 500.The number of MSIX applications per volume shouldn't exceed 60.When using a combination of MSIX applications with both theVHDXandCIM FSfile formats:The number of AVD session hosts per volume shouldn't exceed 500.The number of MSIX applications per volume using theCIM FSfile format shouldn't exceed 24.The number of MSIX applications per volume using theVHDXfile format shouldn't exceed 24.

Important
Using SMB Continuous Availability shares is only supported for Citrix App Layering, SQL Server, FSLogix user profile containers including FSLogix ODFC containers, or MSIX app attach containers. This feature is currently supported on SQL Server on Windows. Any other workload is not supported.
If you are using a non-administrator (domain) account to install SQL Server, ensure the account has the required security privilege assigned. If the domain account does not have the required security privilege (SeSecurityPrivilege), and the privilege cannot be set at the domain level, you can grant the privilege to the account by using the Security privilege users field of Active Directory connections. For more information, seeCreate an Active Directory connection.
SeSecurityPrivilege
Important
Change notifications are not supported with Continuously Available shares in Azure NetApp Files.
Steps
Select the SMB volume that you want to have SMB CA enabled. Then selectEdit.
Select the SMB volume that you want to have SMB CA enabled. Then selectEdit.
On the Edit window that appears, select theEnable Continuous Availabilitycheckbox.

Reboot the Windows systems connecting to the existing SMB share.NoteSelecting theEnable Continuous Availabilityoption alone does not automatically make the existing SMB sessions continuously available. After selecting the option, be sure to reboot the server immediately for the change to take effect.

Use the following command to verify that CA is enabled and used on the system thatâs mounting the volume:get-smbconnection | select -Property servername,ContinuouslyAvailableYou might need to install a newer PowerShell version.If you know the server name, you can use the-ServerNameparameter with the command. See theGet-SmbConnectionPowerShell command details.
