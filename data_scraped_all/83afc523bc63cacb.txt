This article explains how you can save with Azure App Service reserved instances for Premium v3 and Isolated v2 instances.
Save with reserved instances
When you commit to an Azure App Service Premium v3 or Isolatec v2 reserved instance you can save money. The reservation discount is applied automatically to the number of running instances that match the reservation scope and attributes. You don't need to assign a reservation to an instance to get the discounts.
Determine the right reserved instance size before you buy
Before you buy a reservation, you should determine the size of the reserved instance that you need. The following sections will help you determine the right reserved instance size.
Use reservation recommendations
You can use reservation recommendations to help determine the reservations you should purchase.
Purchase recommendations and recommended quantities are shown when you purchase a Premium v3 reserved instance in the Azure portal.
Azure Advisor provides purchase recommendations for individual subscriptions.
You can use the APIs to get purchase recommendations for both shared scope and single subscription scope.
For Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) customers, purchase recommendations for shared and single subscription scopes are available with theAzure Consumption Insights Power BI content pack.
Analyze your usage information
Analyze your usage information to help determine which reservations you should purchase. Usage data is available in the usage file and APIs. Use them together to determine which reservation to purchase. Check for instances that have high usage on daily basis to determine the quantity of reservations to purchase.
Your usage file shows your charges by billing period and daily usage. For information about downloading your usage file, seeView and download your Azure usage and charges. Then, by using the usage file information, you candetermine what reservation to purchase.
