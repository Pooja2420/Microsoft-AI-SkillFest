Once your VMware vSphere resources are enabled in Azure, the final step in setting up a self-service experience for your teams is to provide them with access. This article describes how to use built-in roles to manage granular access to VMware resources through Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and allow your teams to deploy and manage VMs.
Prerequisites
Your vCenter must be connected to Azure Arc.
Your vCenter resources such as Resourcepools/clusters/hosts, networks, templates, and datastores must be Arc-enabled.
You must have User Access Administrator or Owner role at the scope (resource group/subscription) to assign roles to other users.
Provide access to use Arc-enabled vSphere resources
To provision VMware VMs and change their size, add disks, change network interfaces, or delete them, your users need to have permissions on the compute, network, storage, and to the VM template resources that they'll use. These permissions are provided by the built-inAzure Arc VMware Private Cloud Userrole.
You must assign this role on individual resource pool (or cluster or host), network, datastore, and template that a user or a group needs to access.
Go to theVMware vCenterslist in Arc center.

If you have organized your vSphere resources into a resource group, you can provide the same role at the resource group scope.
Your users now have access to VMware vSphere cloud resources. However, your users also need to have permissions on the subscription/resource group where they would like to deploy and manage VMs.
Provide access to subscription or resource group where VMs will be deployed
In addition to having access to VMware vSphere resources through theAzure Arc VMware Private Cloud User, your users must have permissions on the subscription and resource group where they deploy and manage VMs.
TheAzure Arc VMware VM Contributorrole is a built-in role that provides permissions to conduct all VMware virtual machine operations.
