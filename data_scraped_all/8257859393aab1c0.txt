Azure Front Door (classic) will be retired onMarch 31, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure Front Door (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by March 2027. For more information, seeAzure Front Door (classic) retirement.
This quickstart guides you through setting up high availability for a web application using Azure Front Door (classic) via the Azure portal. You configure Azure Front Door to distribute traffic across two web application instances in different Azure regions. The setup uses equal weighted and same priority backends, directing traffic to the nearest available site. Azure Front Door also monitors the health of the web applications and automatically fails over to the next nearest site if the closest one is down.

Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.Create an account for free.
Create two instances of a web app
To complete this quickstart, you need two instances of a web application running in different Azure regions. These instances operate inActive/Activemode, meaning they can handle traffic simultaneously. This setup differs fromActive/Stand-Bymode, where one instance serves as a backup.
If you don't have the web apps already, follow these steps to create them:
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Select+ Create a resourcefrom the top left corner and search forWeb App.

Create a Front Door for your application
Set up Azure Front Door to route user traffic based on the lowest latency between the two web app servers. Start by adding a frontend host for Azure Front Door.

This means that you need to have at least one routing rule for each of your frontend hosts at the default path/*among all of your routing rules. Otherwise, your end-user traffic may not be routed properly.

View Azure Front Door in action
Once you create a Front Door, it takes a few minutes for the configuration to be deployed globally. After deployment, access the frontend host you created by navigating to its address in your browser. Your requests automatically get routed to the nearest server from the specified servers in the backend pool.
If you followed this quickstart to create the web apps, you should see an information page.
To test the instant global failover feature, follow these steps:
Navigate to the resource groupFrontDoorQS_rg0and select the Front Door service.
