Azure Schema Registry in Event Hubs

Event streaming and messaging scenarios often deal with structured data in the event or message payload. However, the structured data is of little value to the event broker, which only deals with bytes. Schema-driven formats such asApache Avro,JSONSchema, orProtobufare often used to serialize or deserialize such structured data to/from binary.
An event producer uses a schema definition to serialize event payload and publish it to an event broker such as Event Hubs. Event consumers read event payload from the broker and deserialize it using the same schema definition.
So, both producers and consumers can validate the integrity of the data with the same schema.

What is Azure Schema Registry?
Azure Schema Registryis a feature of Event Hubs, which provides a central repository for schemas for event-driven and messaging-centric applications. It provides the flexibility for your producer and consumer applications toexchange data without having to manage and share the schema. It also provides a simple governance framework for reusable schemas and defines relationship between schemas through a logical grouping construct (schema groups).

With schema-driven serialization frameworks like Apache Avro, JSONSchema and Protobuf, moving serialization metadata into shared schemas can also help withreducing the per-message overhead. It's because each message doesn't need to have the metadata (type information and field names) as it's the case with tagged formats such as JSON.
Note
The feature is available in theStandard,Premium, andDedicatedtier.
Having schemas stored alongside the events and inside the eventing infrastructure ensures that the metadata required for serialization or deserialization is always in reach and schemas can't be misplaced.
