This feature is deprecated as of May 1, 2024.
A core component of every cyber risk and security program is the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities. Defender for Cloud regularly checks your connected machines to ensure they're running vulnerability assessment tools.
When a machine is found that doesn't have a vulnerability assessment solution deployed, Defender for Cloud generates the security recommendation:Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution.
Use this recommendation to deploy the vulnerability assessment solution to your Azure virtual machines and your Azure Arc-enabled hybrid machines.
Defender for Cloud includes vulnerability scanning for your machines. You don't need a Qualys license or even a Qualys account - everything's handled seamlessly inside Defender for Cloud. This page provides details of this scanner and instructions for how to deploy it.
Tip
The integrated vulnerability assessment solution supports both Azure virtual machines and hybrid machines. To deploy the vulnerability assessment scanner to your on-premises and multicloud machines, connect them to Azure first with Azure Arc as described inConnect your non-Azure machines to Defender for Cloud.
Defender for Cloud's integrated vulnerability assessment solution works seamlessly with Azure Arc. When you've deployed Azure Arc, your machines will appear in Defender for Cloud and no Log Analytics agent is required.
If you don't want to use the vulnerability assessment powered by Qualys, you can useMicrosoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

Overview of the integrated vulnerability scanner
The vulnerability scanner included with Microsoft Defender for Cloud is powered by Qualys. Qualys' scanner is one of the leading tools for real-time identification of vulnerabilities. It's only available withMicrosoft Defender for Servers. You don't need a Qualys license or even a Qualys account - everything's handled seamlessly inside Defender for Cloud.
How the integrated vulnerability scanner works
The vulnerability scanner extension works as follows:
Deploy- Microsoft Defender for Cloud monitors your machines and provides recommendations to deploy the Qualys extension on your selected machine/s.

Gather information- The extension collects artifacts and sends them for analysis in the Qualys cloud service in the defined region.

Your machines appear in one or more of the following groups:

Automate at-scale deployments
Note
All of the tools described in this section are available fromDefender for Cloud's GitHub community repository. There, you can find scripts, automations, and other useful resources to use throughout your Defender for Cloud deployment.
Some of these tools only affect new machines connected after you enable at scale deployment. Others also deploy to existing machines. You can combine multiple approaches.
Some of the ways you can automate deployment at scale of the integrated scanner:
Azure Resource Managerâ This method is available fromview recommendation logicin the Azure portal. The remediation script includes the relevant ARM template you can use for your automation:
DeployIfNotExists policyâA custom policyfor ensuring all newly created machines receive the scanner. SelectDeploy to Azureand set the relevant parameters. You can assign this policy at the level of resource groups, subscriptions, or management groups.
PowerShell Scriptâ Use theUpdate qualys-remediate-unhealthy-vms.ps1script to deploy the extension for all unhealthy virtual machines. To install on new resources, automate the script withAzure Automation. The script finds all unhealthy machines discovered by the recommendation and executes an Azure Resource Manager call.
Update qualys-remediate-unhealthy-vms.ps1
Azure Logic Appsâ Build a logic app based onthe sample app. Use Defender for Cloud'sworkflow automationtools to trigger your logic app to deploy the scanner whenever theMachines should have a vulnerability assessment solutionrecommendation is generated for a resource.
REST APIâ To deploy the integrated vulnerability assessment solution using the Defender for Cloud REST API, make a PUT request for the following URL and add the relevant resource ID:https://management.azure.com/<resourceId>/providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/default?api-Version=2015-06-01-previewâ
https://management.azure.com/<resourceId>/providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessments/default?api-Version=2015-06-01-previewâ
Trigger an on-demand scan
You can trigger an on-demand scan from the machine itself, using locally or remotely executed scripts or Group Policy Object (GPO). Alternatively, you can integrate it into your software distribution tools at the end of a patch deployment job.
The following commands trigger an on-demand scan:
Windows machines:REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Qualys\QualysAgent\ScanOnDemand\Vulnerability /v "ScanOnDemand" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Qualys\QualysAgent\ScanOnDemand\Vulnerability /v "ScanOnDemand" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
Linux machines:sudo /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/cloudagentctl.sh action=demand type=vm
sudo /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/cloudagentctl.sh action=demand type=vm
