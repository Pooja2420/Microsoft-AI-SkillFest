Azure Service Bus Premium provides encryption of data at rest with Azure Storage Service Encryption (Azure SSE). Service Bus Premium uses Azure Storage to store the data. All the data that's stored in Azure Storage is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys. If you use your own key (also referred to as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) or customer-managed key), the data is still encrypted using the Microsoft-managed key, but in addition the Microsoft-managed key is encrypted using the customer-managed key. This feature enables you to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access to customer-managed keys that are used for encrypting Microsoft-managed keys. Enabling the BYOK feature is a one time setup process on your namespace.
There are some caveats to the customer managed key for service side encryption.
This feature is supported byAzure Service Bus Premiumtier. It can't be enabled for standard tier Service Bus namespaces.
The encryption can only be enabled for new or empty namespaces. If the namespace contains any queues or topics, then the encryption operation fails.
You can use Azure Key Vault (including Azure Key Vault Managed Hardware Security Module (HSM)) to manage your keys and audit your key usage. You can either create your own keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use the Azure Key Vault APIs to generate keys. For more information about Azure Key Vault, seeWhat is Azure Key Vault?
If you only need to encrypt certain properties of your messages, consider using a library likeNServiceBus.
Enable customer-managed keys (Azure portal)
To enable customer-managed keys in the Azure portal, follow these steps:
Navigate to your Service Bus Premium namespace.
Navigate to your Service Bus Premium namespace.
On theSettingspage of your Service Bus namespace, selectEncryption.
On theSettingspage of your Service Bus namespace, selectEncryption.
Select theCustomer-managed key encryption at restas shown in the following image.
Select theCustomer-managed key encryption at restas shown in the following image.

Note
Currently you can't configure Azure Key Vault Managed HSM through the portal.
Set up a key vault with keys
After you enable customer-managed keys, you need to associate the customer managed key with your Azure Service Bus namespace. Service Bus supports only Azure Key Vault. If you enable theEncryption with customer-managed keyoption in the previous section, you need to have the key imported into Azure Key Vault. Also, the keys must haveSoft DeleteandDo Not Purgeconfigured for the key. These settings can be configured usingPowerShellorCLI.
Create key vault or key vault managed HSM
Important
Using customer-managed keys with Azure Service Bus requires that the vault have two required properties configured. They are:Soft DeleteandDo Not Purge. The Soft Delete property is enabled by default when you create a new vault in the Azure portal whereas the Purge Protection is optional so make sure to select it when creating the vault. Also, if you need to enable these properties on an existing key vault, you must use either PowerShell or Azure CLI.

Managed identities
There are two types of managed identities that you can assign to a Service Bus namespace.
System-assigned: You can enable a managed identity directly on a Service Bus namespace. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Microsoft Entra that's tied to the lifecycle of that Service Bus namespace. So when the namespace is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource (namespace) can use this identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.
User-assigned: You can also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource, which is called user-assigned identity. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more Service Bus namespaces. When you use user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it. They aren't tied to the lifecycle of the namespace. You can explicitly delete a user-assigned identity when you no longer need it.
For more information, seeWhat are managed identities for Azure resources?.

Encrypt using user-assigned identities (template)
Create auser-assigned identity.
Create akey vaultand grant access to the user-assigned identity via access policies.
Create apremiumService Bus namespace with the managed user-identity and the key vault information.
Create a user-assigned identity
Follow instructions from theCreate a user-assigned managed identityarticle to create a user-assigned identity. You can also create a user-assigned identity usingCLI,PowerShell,Azure Resource Manager template, andREST.
Note
You can assign up to4user identities to a namespace. These associations are deleted when the namespace is deleted or when you pass theidentity -> typein the template toNone.

None
Grant access to user-assigned identity
Get theService principal IDfor the user identity using the following PowerShell command. In the example,ud1is the user-assigned identity to be used for encryption.$servicePrincipal=Get-AzADServicePrincipal -SearchString "ud1"

Create a premium Service Bus namespace with user identity and key vault information
This section gives you an example that shows you how to do the following tasks using an Azure Resource Manager template.
Assign a user-managed identity to a Service Bus namespace."identity": {
                "type": "UserAssigned",
                "userAssignedIdentities": {
                    "[parameters('identity').userAssignedIdentity]": {}
                }
            },
Assign a user-managed identity to a Service Bus namespace.

                    "[parameters('identity').userAssignedIdentity]": {}
                }
            },
Enable encryption on the namespace by specifying a key from your key vault and the user-managed identity to access the key."encryption":{
                   "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",
                   "keyVaultProperties":[

Use both user-assigned and system-assigned identities
A namespace can have both system-assigned and user-assigned identities at the same time. In this case, thetypeproperty would beSystemAssigned,UserAssignedas shown in the following example.
type
SystemAssigned
UserAssigned
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned, UserAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<userIdentity1>" : {}
    }
}
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned, UserAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<userIdentity1>" : {}
    }
}
In this scenario, you can choose either the system-assigned identity or the user-assigned identity for encrypting the data at rest.
In the Resource Manager template, if you don't specify anidentityattribute, the system-managed identity is used. Here's an example snippet.
identity
"properties":{
   "encryption":{
      "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",
      "keyVaultProperties":[
         {
            "keyName":"[parameters('keyName')]",
            "keyVaultUri":"[parameters('keyVaultUri')]"
         }
      ]
   }
}
"properties":{
   "encryption":{
      "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",
      "keyVaultProperties":[
         {
            "keyName":"[parameters('keyName')]",
            "keyVaultUri":"[parameters('keyVaultUri')]"
         }
      ]
   }
}
See the following example for using the user-managed identity for the encryption. Notice theidentityattribute is set to the user-managed identity.
identity
"properties":{
   "encryption":{
      "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",
      "keyVaultProperties":[
         {
            "keyName":"[parameters('keyName')]",
            "keyVaultUri":"[parameters('keyVaultUri')]",
            "identity": {
                "userAssignedIdentity": "[parameters('identity').userAssignedIdentity]"
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
"properties":{
   "encryption":{
      "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",
      "keyVaultProperties":[
         {
            "keyName":"[parameters('keyName')]",
            "keyVaultUri":"[parameters('keyVaultUri')]",
            "identity": {
                "userAssignedIdentity": "[parameters('identity').userAssignedIdentity]"
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
Enable infrastructure (double) encryption of data
If you require a higher level of assurance that your data is secure, you can enable infrastructure level encryption, which is also known as Double Encryption.
When infrastructure encryption is enabled, data in the Azure Service Bus is encrypted twice, once at the service level and once at the infrastructure level, using two different encryption algorithms and two different keys. Hence, infrastructure encryption of Azure Service Bus data protects against a scenario where one of the encryption algorithms or keys can be compromised.
Also, infrastructure encryption can be enabled only while switching from "Microsoft-managed key" to "Customer-managed key".
You can enable infrastructure encryption later even by updating the Azure Resource Manager template withrequireInfrastructureEncryptionproperty in theUpdateServiceBusNamespaceWithEncryption.jsonas shown in the following example.
requireInfrastructureEncryption
"properties":{
   "encryption":{
      "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",    
      "requireInfrastructureEncryption":true,         
      "keyVaultProperties":[
         {
            "keyName":"[parameters('keyName')]",
            "keyVaultUri":"[parameters('keyVaultUri')]"
         }
      ]
   }
}
"properties":{
   "encryption":{
      "keySource":"Microsoft.KeyVault",    
      "requireInfrastructureEncryption":true,         
      "keyVaultProperties":[
         {
            "keyName":"[parameters('keyName')]",
            "keyVaultUri":"[parameters('keyVaultUri')]"
         }
      ]
   }
}
Rotate, revoke, and cache keys
Rotate your encryption keys
You can rotate your key in the key vault by using the Azure Key Vaults rotation mechanism. Activation and expiration dates can also be set to automate key rotation. The Service Bus service detects new key versions and starts using them automatically.
Revoke access to keys
Revoking access to the encryption keys won't purge the data from Service Bus. However, the data can't be accessed from the Service Bus namespace. You can revoke the encryption key through access policy or by deleting the key. Learn more about access policies and securing your key vault fromSecure access to a key vault.
Once the encryption key is revoked, the Service Bus service on the encrypted namespace becomes inoperable. If the access to the key is enabled or the deleted key is restored, Service Bus service picks the key so you can access the data from the encrypted Service Bus namespace.
Caching of keys
The Service Bus instance polls its listed encryption keys every 5 minutes. It caches and uses them until the next poll, which is after 5 minutes. As long as at least one key is available, queues, and topics are accessible. If all listed keys are inaccessible when it polls, all queues and topics become unavailable.
Here are more details:
Every 5 minutes, the Service Bus service polls all customer-managed keys listed in the namespaceâs record:If a key was rotated, the record is updated with the new key.If a key was revoked, the key is removed from the record.If all keys were revoked, the namespaceâs encryption status is set toRevoked. The data can't be accessed from the Service Bus namespace.
If a key was rotated, the record is updated with the new key.
If a key was revoked, the key is removed from the record.
If all keys were revoked, the namespaceâs encryption status is set toRevoked. The data can't be accessed from the Service Bus namespace.
Considerations when using Geo-Disaster Recovery
Encryption with system-assigned identities
To enable encryption of Microsoft-managed key with a customer managed key, anaccess policyis set up for a system-assigned managed identity on the specified Azure KeyVault. This step ensures controlled access to the Azure KeyVault from the Azure Service Bus namespace. Therefore, you need to follow these steps:
IfGeo-Disaster Recoveryis already enabled for the Service Bus namespace and you're looking to enable customer managed key, thenBreak the pairing.Set up the access policyfor the system-assigned managed identity for both the primary and secondary namespaces to the key vault.Set up encryption on the primary namespace.Re-pair the primary and secondary namespaces.
Break the pairing.
Set up the access policyfor the system-assigned managed identity for both the primary and secondary namespaces to the key vault.
Set up encryption on the primary namespace.
Re-pair the primary and secondary namespaces.
If you're looking to enable Geo-Disaster Recovery on a Service Bus namespace where customer-managed key is already set up, then follow these steps:Set up the access policyfor the managed identity for the secondary namespace to the key vault.Pair the primary and secondary namespaces.
Set up the access policyfor the managed identity for the secondary namespace to the key vault.
Pair the primary and secondary namespaces.
Encryption with user-assigned identities
Here are a few recommendations:
Create managed identity and assign Key Vault permissions to your managed identity.
Add the identity as a user assigned identity, and enable encryption with the identity on both namespaces.
Pair namespaces together.
Conditions for enabling Geo-Disaster Recovery and Encryption with User-Assigned Identities:
Secondary namespace must already have Encryption enabled with a User-Assigned identity if it's to be paired with a primary namespace that has Encryption enabled.
It isn't possible to enable Encryption on an already paired primary, even if the secondary has a User-Assigned identity associated with the namespace.
Troubleshoot
Symptom
You get an error stating that the Service Bus namespace is disabled because the encryption key is no longer valid.
Cause
You're be using theresource_idorversion, which links to a specific version of the key, which is expired. If a specific version is provided, Service Bus uses that version of the key, even if the key is rotated.
resource_id
version
Resolution
Use theresource__versionless_idorversionless_idinstead of usingresource_idorversion.
resource__versionless_id
versionless_id
