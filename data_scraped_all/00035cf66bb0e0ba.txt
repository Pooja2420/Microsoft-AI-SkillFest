The data-access layer services are also independently scaled based on load. Data services manage data models, connection clients, and drivers. The services also provide a consistent data interface for all higher-level services wishing to consume data in the application. You can deploy and scale these data services using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Each AKS cluster is responsible for a set of related features in the layer. AKS can implement a microservice architecture, which features a series of containers that each encapsulate specific functionality within the cluster. This allows for a high degree of abstraction and de-coupling within the code. It also allows for clusters to scale out individually to account for increased load from multiple tenants. Each cluster can scale up its resources if load increases on the cluster. The scale up doesn't affect the other clusters in the resource group as long as they aren't experiencing the same increase.

Store and manage relational data outside of the application framework. Doing so provides a single point of data entry for either region. You can achieve replication, availability, scalability, and security by leveraging the strength of Azure SQL Elastic Pools. Provision each tenant a database in a pool. Allocate the resources available in the pool to databases on-demand as load and requests come in. This optimizes database resources available for tenants against your budget.

Azure SQL Elastic Pools: Provides a solution for managing a set of databases flexibly with a pool of resources. The service allocates resources on demand to the databases. It gives the developer of a multitenant SaaS architecture the power to deliver database resources to clients as they need it. The service also reduces the budget and overhead of maintaining multiple SQL Servers with large chunks of unused compute resources.

Alternatives components
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets: Allows for the deployment of services to a virtual machine (VM) environment that scales and grows automatically as needed. Virtual Machine Scale Sets integrate well with aLoad Balanceror Application Gateway to automatically rebalance load as the scale set grows. Virtual Machine Scale Sets provides the scalability this solution demands. In many cases though, it's unnecessary to manage the full VM environment, and we can defer that level of the stack to App Service or AKS.

Azure SQL Database: Implement as individual dedicated instances as a replacement for Elastic Pools. Using Azure SQL Database adds higher overhead in managing the instance directly and incurs more cost for allocated resources. That said, it's an acceptable alternative when the tenant requires a dedicated server. In particular, the client might require more control over the instance and dedicated available resources. Tenants that require a dedicated SQL Server can exist side by side with tenants on an Elastic Pool configuration. You can make a tier of SQL databases one of the pricing options available to tenants when purchasing licenses for the SaaS.

In that case, the tenant might want to use their current licenses, either as a full migration or in a hybrid scenario. The decoupled nature of the SaaS allows for the data layer of the application to target any SQL Database via configuration.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
Multitenancy
A multitenant solution is the key consideration in this solution. The solution handles a number of clients simultaneously. It also allocates enough resources to process all client requests effectively. While processing requests, the solution secures traffic from global endpoints and isolates client data to prevent breaches and cross-contamination. Deploy clients to a pair of regional resource groups based on their primary location. Doing so optimizes regional availability.
You can deploy many clients to a single compute group because the system isolates requests based on authentication and client keys, which differentiates requests based on these unique identifiers. The system can encrypt all client requests separately by their keys so that no client can decrypt any other client's data. Managing multiple clients on a single compute stack gives you the ability to optimize resource allocation to provide clients the responsiveness they need at cost.
You manage client databases in a similar way outside of the compute stack, because a client request could arrive from either of the regional stacks. Many client databases can exist on the same Elastic Pool, isolated and secured by transparent data encryption (TDE). You can configure each database to encrypt data using a client-managed key and decrypt the data just in time (JIT). Decrypting JIT protects client data from both the developer and other clients. The system leverages the Elastic Pool to provide resources on demand to the clients assigned to it while keeping costs low for you. You can assign replication policies to each Elastic Pool to provide backup and failover for client data. Bring more Elastic Pools online as you onboard more clients into the system.

Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
This solution is designed to account for a large number of tenants using the SaaS. It takes advantage of the large number of scalable components and services to grow based on load. This architecture isn't designed for solutions that service a few tenants, or a small load of requests and data. It could stress the budget of a solution targeting a single client or smaller load. It's also unnecessary to have the multiregion overhead where high global availability isn't a requirement, because it adds unnecessary complexity and cost.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
The system addresses security from end-to-end at each level of the application:
Azure Front Door provides built-in HTTPS support for its domains. This means the system can encrypt all traffic to the SaaS application. Azure Front Door also implements Azure Web Application Firewall, protecting the SaaS stack from attacks at the edge, before the system routes requests to the application.

Each application stack in each region lies within an Azure Virtual Network. The system restricts traffic into the virtual network accepting requests from Azure Front Door, protecting all application services from external traffic. Once inside the secure firewall, Application Gateway can terminate SSL and provide performant load balancing and routing within the application.

Once inside the secure firewall, Application Gateway can terminate SSL and provide performant load balancing and routing within the application.
You can securely manage all credentials, secrets, and connection strings by using Azure Key Vault. By managing this sensitive data as secrets, developers can inject credentials into the application at the time of deployment. Doing so makes sure that the code isn't polluted with sensitive information. Using secrets protects client data by ensuring that a breach in code or man-in-the-middle attack wouldn't gain access to tenant databases.

In this scenario, the data of multiple tenants might exist side by side on the same database server, if not the same database. Using TDE and JIT decryption protects data on the database. The system encrypts all data on the database at rest, and only decrypts it when requested by the tenant. Clients can provide their own keys, and you can store all client keys in Azure Key Vault to manage encryption for multiple tenants. It protects client data end to end, prevents the developer from having access to client data, isolates data between tenants, and helps to meet compliance requirements for security and data.

Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.
Azure App Service provides many pricing tiers based on the expected compute resources required. For a multitenant SaaS, high availability and scale-out capabilities are key components in choosing the service plan. If you expect to host many tenants, choosing a premium or isolated tier might be necessary to provide the compute resources necessary to account for the high traffic. The standard, premium, and isolated tiers are all dedicated VM instances. You can calculate cost per unit of time by how many VMs of said tier you've specified. For more information, visit theoverview of App Service pricing plans.

By design, the Azure SQL Elastic Pool pricing is highly cost-effective in a multitenant scenario. Tenant databases in an Elastic Pool will share the available resources. As demand shifts between tenants over time, resources will shift as well.  Azure SQL Elastic Pool provides the maximum available resources to demanded databases without the need for resource overhead on all databases. The service keeps cost low for the developer of the SaaS and the tenants. Use theAzure SQL Database pricing calculatorto price out and determine the tier and amount of resources needed to serve your tenants and their data.
Using a virtual core (vCore) pricing model provides greater flexibility in scaling to meet required resources. Also, you can take advantage of the Azure Hybrid Benefit. Existing SQL Server licenses provide a discount to vCore SQL resources in the cloud. Therefore, in an instance when on-premises servers are already part of the developer infrastructure, you can manage cost even more by using these discounts. You can estimate your potential savings by using theAzure Hybrid Benefit savings calculator.

You can also save cost on SQL Server resources by purchasingAzure SQL Database reserved capacity. Purchasing reserved capacity marks a commitment of long-term SQL Database usage. The term is usually between one to three years. In return, you get discounts on the compute costs of the resources in reservation. For instance, you could reserve 32 general purpose vCores for a year, which reduces the cost of those 32 vCores for that year. Having multiple tenants purchasing licenses for a SaaS is a strong indicator that making use of Reserved capacity fits the solution, and an ideal cost saver in this workload.

You can find the pricing structure for Azure Cache for Redis on theAzure Cache for Redis pricingpage. Adjust the cache tier at any time between a Basic, Standard, and Premium tier based on need. You'll see higher pricing on the larger cache limits and additional features such as replication and disaster recovery. Azure Cache for Redis also offers reserved capacity pricing for long-term usage commitments.
Azure Front Door's pricing depends on the amount of data transfer in and out of the service. For outbound data, the pricing is different based on zones. Different regions will incur different costs. If you come across a price differential, estimate the cost separately. The price includes some routing and domain capacity, but the system incurs costs past the initial limits. Azure Web Application Firewall incurs a small additional charge per policy or rule applied. You can find the pricing details for Azure Front Door on theAzure Front Door pricingpage.
Thepricing for AI Searchis a fully tiered system. A free tier is available for development and testing. After that, each tier incurs a per-hour cost for each AI Search instance allocated. As the tiers increase, the total storage, number of indexes, and scale-out limits also increase. AI Search provides image extraction as a service at the same rate to all paid tiers.
