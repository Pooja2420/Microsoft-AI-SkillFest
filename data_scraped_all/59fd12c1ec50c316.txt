Returns a sha256 hash value of the source input.
Syntax
hash_sha256(source)
hash_sha256(
)

Parameters
Returns
The sha256 hash value of the given scalar, encoded as a hex string (a string
of characters, each two of which represent a single Hex number between 0
and 255).
Warning
The algorithm used by this function (SHA256) is guaranteed
to not be modified in the future, but is very complex to calculate. Users that
need a "lightweight" hash function for the duration of a single query are advised
to use the functionhash()instead.
Examples
Run the query
print 
    h1=hash_sha256("World"),
    h2=hash_sha256(datetime(2020-01-01))
print 
    h1=hash_sha256("World"),
    h2=hash_sha256(datetime(2020-01-01))
Output
The following example uses thehash_sha256()function to aggregate StormEvents based on State's SHA256 hash value.
hash_sha256()
Run the query
StormEvents 
| summarize StormCount = count() by State, StateHash=hash_sha256(State)
| top 5 by StormCount desc
StormEvents 
| summarize StormCount = count() by State, StateHash=hash_sha256(State)
| top 5 by StormCount desc
Output
