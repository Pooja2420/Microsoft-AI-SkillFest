Learn how to create Azure HDInsight Apache HBase clusters in anAzure Virtual Network.
With virtual network integration, Apache HBase clusters can be deployed to the same virtual network as your applications so that applications can communicate with HBase directly. The benefits include:
Direct connectivity of the web application to the nodes of the HBase cluster, which enables communication via HBase Java remote procedure call (RPC) APIs.
Improved performance by not having your traffic go over multiple gateways and load-balancers.
The ability to process sensitive information in a more secure manner without exposing a public endpoint.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create Apache HBase cluster into virtual network
In this section, you create a Linux-based Apache HBase cluster with the dependent Azure Storage account in an Azure virtual network using anAzure Resource Manager template. For other cluster creation methods and understanding the settings, seeCreate HDInsight clusters. For more information about using a template to create Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight, seeCreate Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using Azure Resource Manager templates
Note
Some properties are hard-coded into the template. For example:
Location: East US 2
Cluster version: 3.6
Cluster worker node count: 2
Default storage account: a unique string
Virtual network name: CLUSTERNAME-vnet
Virtual network address space: 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet name: subnet1
Subnet address range: 10.0.0.0/24
CLUSTERNAMEis replaced with the cluster name you provide when using the template.
CLUSTERNAME

After you complete the article, you might want to delete the cluster. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it isn't in use. You're also charged for a HDInsight cluster, even when it isn't in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they aren't in use. For the instructions of deleting a cluster, seeManage Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight by using the Azure portal.
To begin working with your new HBase cluster, you can use the procedures found inGet started using Apache HBase with Apache Hadoop in HDInsight.
Connect to the Apache HBase cluster using Apache HBase Java RPC APIs
Create a virtual machine
Create an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machine into the same Azure virtual network and the same subnet. For instructions on creating a new IaaS virtual machine, seeCreate a Virtual Machine Running Windows Server. When following the steps in this document, you must use the following values for the Network configuration:
Virtual network: CLUSTERNAME-vnet
Subnet: subnet1
Important
ReplaceCLUSTERNAMEwith the name you used when creating the HDInsight cluster in previous steps.
CLUSTERNAME
By using these values, the virtual machine is placed in the same virtual network and subnet as the HDInsight cluster. This configuration allows them to directly communicate with each other. There's a way to create a HDInsight cluster with an empty edge node. The edge node can be used to manage the cluster.  For more information, seeUse empty edge nodes in HDInsight.
Obtain fully qualified domain name
When you use a Java application to connect to HBase remotely, you must use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). To determine, you must get the connection-specific DNS suffix of the HBase cluster. To do that, you can use one of the following methods:
Use a Web browser to make anApache Ambaricall:Browse tohttps://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTERNAME/hosts?minimal_response=true. It returns a JSON file with the DNS suffixes.

https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTERNAME/hosts?minimal_response=true
Use the Ambari website:Browse tohttps://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net.SelectHostsfrom the top menu.

Use Curl to make REST calls:curl -u <username>:<password> -k https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/services/hbase/components/hbrest
Use Curl to make REST calls:
curl -u <username>:<password> -k https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/services/hbase/components/hbrest
curl -u <username>:<password> -k https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/services/hbase/components/hbrest
In the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data returned, find the "host_name" entry. It contains the FQDN for the nodes in the cluster. For example:
"host_name" : "hn*.hjfrnszlumfuhfk4pi1guh410c.bx.internal.cloudapp.net"
"host_name" : "hn*.hjfrnszlumfuhfk4pi1guh410c.bx.internal.cloudapp.net"
The portion of the domain name beginning with the cluster name is the DNS suffix. For example,hjfrnszlumfuhfk4pi1guh410c.bx.internal.cloudapp.net.
hjfrnszlumfuhfk4pi1guh410c.bx.internal.cloudapp.net
Verify communication inside virtual network
To verify that the virtual machine can communicate with the HBase cluster, use the commandping headnode0.<dns suffix>from the virtual machine. For example,ping hn*.hjfrnszlumfuhfk4pi1guh410c.bx.internal.cloudapp.net.
ping headnode0.<dns suffix>
ping hn*.hjfrnszlumfuhfk4pi1guh410c.bx.internal.cloudapp.net
To use this information in a Java application, you can follow the steps inUse Apache Maven to build Java applications that use Apache HBase with HDInsight (Hadoop)to create an application. To have the application connect to a remote HBase server, modify thehbase-site.xmlfile in this example to use the FQDN for Zookeeper. For example:
<property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>zookeeper0.<dns suffix>,zookeeper1.<dns suffix>,zookeeper2.<dns suffix></value>
</property>
<property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>zookeeper0.<dns suffix>,zookeeper1.<dns suffix>,zookeeper2.<dns suffix></value>
</property>
