Supported aggregations
TheAggregation Typecolumn in the table corresponds to the default aggregation that is used when the metric is selected for a chart or alert.

For most metrics, all aggregation types are valid. For count metrics with aUnitcolumn value ofCount, only some aggregations are valid. Count metrics can be one of two types:
ForSingle-pointcount metrics, IoT Hub registers a single data point (essentially a 1) every time the measured operation occurs. Azure Monitor then sums these data points over the specified granularity. Examples ofSingle-pointmetrics areTelemetry messages sentandC2D message deliveries completed. For these metrics, the only relevant aggregation type is Total (Sum). The portal allows you to choose minimum, maximum, and average. These values are always 1.

ForSnapshotcount metrics, IoT Hub registers a total count when the measured operation occurs. Currently, there are threeSnapshotmetrics emitted by IoT Hub:Total number of messages used,Total devices, andConnected devices. Because these metrics present a "total" quantity every time, summing them over the specified granularity makes no sense. Azure Monitor limits you to selecting average, minimum, and maximum for the aggregation type for these metrics.

Cloud-to-device commands category
The cloud-to-device commands category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to the cloud-to-device message pipeline. This category includes errors that occur from:
Sending cloud-to-device messages (like unauthorized sender errors),
Receiving cloud-to-device messages (like delivery count exceeded errors), and
Receiving cloud-to-device message feedback (like feedback expired errors).
This category doesn't catch errors when the cloud-to-device message is delivered successfully but then improperly handled by the device.

Distributed tracing category (preview)
The distributed tracing category tracks the correlation IDs for messages that carry the trace context header. To fully enable these logs, client-side code must be updated by followingAnalyze and diagnose IoT applications end-to-end with IoT Hub distributed tracing (preview).
ThecorrelationIdconforms to theW3C Trace Contextproposal, where it contains atrace-idand aspan-id.

IoT Hub records this log when a message containing valid trace properties arrives at IoT Hub.

Here,durationMsisn't calculated as IoT Hub's clock might not be in sync with the device clock, and thus a duration calculation can be misleading. We recommend writing logic using the timestamps in thepropertiessection to capture spikes in device-to-cloud latency.

File upload operations category
The file upload category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to file upload functionality. This category includes:
Errors that occur with the SAS URI, such as when it expires before a device notifies the hub of a completed upload.
Failed uploads reported by the device.
Errors that occur when a file isn't found in storage during IoT Hub notification message creation.
This category can't catch errors that directly occur while the device is uploading a file to storage.

Routes category
Themessage routingcategory tracks errors that occur during message route evaluation and endpoint health as perceived by IoT Hub. This category includes events such as:
A rule evaluates to "undefined"
IoT Hub marks an endpoint as dead
Any errors received from an endpoint
This category doesn't include specific errors about the messages themselves (like device throttling errors), which are reported under the "device telemetry" category.
