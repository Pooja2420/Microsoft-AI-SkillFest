The following lists provide up-to-date information on which OS images are tagged as supported for remote NVM Express (NVMe).
Important
Only Gen2 VM images with security type "Standard" support NVMe. For more information, seeFAQ for NVMe. Older operating systems cannot support NVMe due to OS driver limitations. If an older version of the OS is not included in the list below, it means that NVMe support is not present for that OS.
For specifics about which virtual machine (VM) generations support which storage types, check thedocumentation about VM sizes in Azure.
For more information about enabling the NVMe interface on virtual machines created in Azure, review theFAQ for remote NVMe disks.
