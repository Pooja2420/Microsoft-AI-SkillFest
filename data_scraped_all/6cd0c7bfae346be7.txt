This article builds on several considerations and recommendations defined inAzure landing zone design area for network topology and connectivity. It offers key design considerations and best practices for networking and connectivity of your Oracle instance that runs on Azure Virtual Machines. Because Oracle supports mission-critical workloads, you should include the guidance for the Azure landing zone design areas in your design.
Prioritize security for Oracle workloads
As with most production databases, securing an Oracle workload is essential. The database must remain private and have no public endpoints. Only authorized cloud services such as a business application or web front-end services should control access to the data. A select few authorized individuals can manage any production database by using a secured service. For more information, seePlan for VM remote access.
High-level network design
The following architecture diagram shows networking considerations for Oracle instances within an Azure landing zone.

Ensure that all solution services reside within a single virtual network.

Use Azure Firewall, Azure Application Gateway, or other security mechanisms to ensure that only essential traffic is allowed to access the solution.

Monitor and filter traffic by using Azure Monitor, Azure network security groups (NSGs), or application security groups.

Ensure that all VMs that directly support the Oracle database reside in a dedicated subnet and are kept secure from the internet.

The Oracle database subnet should include an NSG that allows the following traffic:
Inbound port 22 or 3389 if Oracle database services are running on Windows from a secure source only. For more information about secure VM access, seePlan for VM remote access.

Inbound port 1521 from the front-end subnet only. The front-end subnet should followbest practices for internet facing workloads.

Change ports when security requires obfuscation. Don't use default ports.

If you use Azure Bastion to access the Oracle database server, make sure theAzureBastionSubnetincludes an NSG that allows inbound traffic on port 443.
