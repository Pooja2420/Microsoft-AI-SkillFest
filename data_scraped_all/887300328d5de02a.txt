How do remote environments work?
To use remote environments, you can enable remote state to ensure the environment state automatically persists to the configured remote store. Meaning anyazdcommand that writes to yourazd.envorconfig.jsonfile will automatically persist.
azd
azd
.env
config.json
Configure remote state
Remote state forazdcan be configured globally inazd'sconfig.jsonor by project within theazure.yaml. If remote state is not set up, environment values and configuration continue to be stored locally.
azd
azd
config.json
azure.yaml
You can configure remote state within thestate.remoteelement ofazdconfiguration
state.remote
azd
backend: The name of the backend type used for remote state
config: Map of key/value pairs unique to each remote state provider
Enable by project
name: azd-project-name
state:
  remote:
    backend: AzureBlobStorage
    config:
      accountName: saazdremotestate
      containerName: myproject # Defaults to project name if not specified
name: azd-project-name
state:
  remote:
    backend: AzureBlobStorage
    config:
      accountName: saazdremotestate
      containerName: myproject # Defaults to project name if not specified
Enable globally
{
  "state": {
    "remote": {
      "backend": "AzureBlobStorage",
      "config": {
        "accountName": "saazdremotestate"
      }
    }
  }
}
{
  "state": {
    "remote": {
      "backend": "AzureBlobStorage",
      "config": {
        "accountName": "saazdremotestate"
      }
    }
  }
}
Supported Remote state backends
Azure Blob Storage
azdwrites.envandconfig.jsonfiles to an Azure storage blob container
azd
.env
config.json
accountName: Name of the Azure storage account
containerName: Name of the container within the storage account where configuration is stored. Defaults to the current azd project name if not specified
endpoint: Azure Endpoint used when configuring remote state.Defaults tocore.windows.net
core.windows.net
Remote state andazdcommands
azd
azd env list
azd env list
Lists all local and remote environments available. For example:

azd env select
azd env select
When selecting an environment that does not exist locally, the remote state is copied to a new local environment.
For example, consider the output fromazd env listabove. To copy the remote state,devto your local environment you would run the following:
azd env list
dev
azd env select dev
azd env select dev
