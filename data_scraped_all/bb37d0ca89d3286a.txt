The images shown in your web portal might differ from the images in this article due to system updates, but the basic functionality remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.
Service accounts
The system generates a few service accounts to support specific operations. The following table describes these user accounts, which get added at the organization or collection level.

Groups
You can grant permissions directly to an individual, or to a group.
Using groups makes things simpler and the system provides several built-in groups for that purpose.
These groups and the default permissions they're assigned get defined at different levels: server (on-premises deployment only), project collection, project, and specific objects. You can also create your own groups and grant them the specific set of permissions that are appropriate for certain roles in your organization.
Note
Security groups are managed at the organization level, even if they are used for specific projects. Depending on user permissions, some groups might be hidden in the web portal. To view all group names within an organization, you can use the Azure DevOps CLI tool or our REST APIs.  For more information, seeAdd and manage security groups.
Note
Security groups are managed at the collection level, even if they are used for specific projects. Depending on user permissions, some groups might be hidden in the web portal. To view all group names within a collection, you can use the Azure DevOps CLI tool or our REST APIs.  For more information, seeAdd and manage security groups.
Server-level groups
When you install Azure DevOps Server, the system creates default groups that havedeployment-wide, server-level permissions. You can't remove or delete the built-in server-level groups.

You can't remove or delete the default server level groups.
The full name of each of these groups is[Team Foundation]\{group name}. So the full name of the server level administrators group is[Team Foundation]\Team Foundation Administrators.
Group name
Permissions
Membership
Azure DevOps Service Accounts
Has service-level permissions for the server instance.
Contains the service account that was supplied during installation
This group should contain only service accounts
and not user accounts or groups that contain user accounts.
By default, this group is a member ofTeam Foundation Administrators.
To add an account to this group after you install Azure DevOps Server, use the TFSSecurity.exe utility in theToolssubfolder of your on-premises installation directory. Use the following command:TFSSecurity /g+ "[TEAM FOUNDATION]\Team Foundation Service Accounts" n:domain\username /server:http(s)://azuredevopsservername.
TFSSecurity /g+ "[TEAM FOUNDATION]\Team Foundation Service Accounts" n:domain\username /server:http(s)://azuredevopsservername
Azure DevOps Proxy Service Accounts
Has service level permissions for Azure DevOps Server Proxy,
and some service-level permissions.
Note
This account gets created when youinstall the Azure DevOps proxy service.
This group should contain only service accounts and not user accounts or groups
that contain user accounts.
Azure DevOps Valid Users
Has permission to view server instance-level information.
Contains all users known to exist in the server instance.
You can't modify the membership of this group.
Team Foundation Administrators
Has permissions to perform all server-level operations.
Local Administratorsgroup (BUILTIN\Administrators)
for any server that hosts Azure DevOPs/Team Foundation application services.
Server\Team Foundation Service Accountsgroup
and the members of the\Project Server Integration Service Accountsgroup.
Limit this group to the fewest users who require full administrative control over server-level operations.
Note
If your deployment uses Reporting, consideradding the members of this groupto the Content Managers groups in Reporting Services.
Collection-level groups
When you create an organization or project collection in Azure DevOps, the system creates collection-level groups that havepermissions in that collection. You can't remove or delete the built-in collection-level groups.
Note
To enable theOrganizations Permissions Settings Page v2preview page,seeEnable preview features. The preview page provides a group settings page that the current page doesn't.
Preview page

Preview page is not available for on-premises versions.


The full name of each of these groups is[{collection name}]\{group name}.
So the full name of the administrator group for the default collection is[Default Collection]\Project Collection Administrators.
Group name
Permissions
Membership
Project Collection Administrators
Has permissions to perform all operations for the collection.
Contains theLocal Administratorsgroup (BUILTIN\Administrators)
for the server where the application-tier services are installed.
Contains the members of theCollectionName/Service Accountsgroup.
Limit this group to the fewest users who require full administrative control over the collection.
Note
If your deployment uses Reporting Services, consider adding the members of this group to theTeam Foundation Content Managers groups in Reporting Services.
Project Collection Build Administrators
Has permissions to administer build resources and permissions for the collection.
Limit this group to the fewest users who require full administrative control over build servers and services for this collection.
Project Collection Build Service Accounts
Has permissions to run build services for the collection.
Limit this group to service accounts and groups that contain only service accounts. This is a legacy group used for XAML builds. Use the Project Collection Build Service ({your organization}) user for managing permissions for current builds.
Project Collection Proxy Service Accounts
Has permissions to run the proxy service for the collection.
Limit this group to service accounts and groups that contain only service accounts.
Project Collection Service Accounts
Has service level permissions for the collection and for Azure DevOps Server.
Contains the service account that was supplied during installation. This group should contain only service accounts and groups that contain only service accounts. By default, this group is a member of the Administrators group.
Project Collection Test Service Accounts
Has test service permissions for the collection.
Limit this group to service accounts and groups that contain only service accounts.
Project Collection Valid Users
Has permissions to access team projects and view information in the collection.
Contains all users and groups added anywhere within the collection. You can't modify the membership of this group.
Project-Scoped Users
Has limited access to view organization settings and projects other than those projects they are specifically added to. Also, people picker options are limited to those users and groups explicitly added to the project the user is connected to.
Add users to this group when you want to limit their visibility and access to those projects that you explicitly add them to. don't add users to this group if they are also added to the Project Collection Administrators group.
Note
TheProject-Scoped Usersgroup becomes available with limited access when the organization-level preview feature,Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projectsis enabled. For more information including important security-related call-outs, seeManage your organization, Limit  user visibility for projects and more.
Security Service Group
Used to store users with permissions, but not added to any other security group.
Don't assign users to this group. If you're removing users from all security groups, check whether you need to remove them from this group.

Project-level groups
For each project that you create, the system creates the followings project-level groups. These groups are assignedproject-level permissions.
Note
To enable the preview page for theProject Permissions Settings Page, seeEnable preview features.

Tip
The full name of each of these groups is[{project name}]\{group name}.
For example, the contributors group for a project called "My Project" is[My Project]\Contributors.

Permissions
Membership
Build Administrators
Has permissions to administer build resources and build permissions for the project. Members can manage test environments, create test runs, and manage builds.
Assign to users who define and manage build pipelines.
Contributors
Has permissions to contribute fully to the project code base and work item tracking. The main permissions they don't have are permissions that manage or administer resources.
By default, the team group created when you create a project is added to this group, and any user you add to the team or project is a member of this group. In addition, any team you create for a project is added to this group.
Readers
Has permissions to view project information, the code base, work items, and other artifacts but not modify them.
Assign to members of your organization or collection who you want to provide view-only permissions to a project. These users can view backlogs, boards, dashboards, and more, but not add or edit anything.
Project Administrators
Has permissions to administer all aspects of teams and project, although they can't create team projects.
Assign to users who require the following functions: Manage user permissions, create or edit teams, modify team settings, define area or iteration paths, or customize work item tracking. Members of the Project Administrators group have permissions to perform the following tasks:
Add and remove users from project membership
Add and remove custom security groups from a project
Add and administer all project teams and team-related features
Edit project level permission ACLs
Editevent subscriptions (email or SOAP)for teams or project-level events.
Project Valid Users
Has permissions to access and view project information.
Contains all users and groups added anywhere to the project. You can't modify the membership of this group.
Note
We recommend that you don't change the default permissions for this group.
Release Administrators
Has permissions to manage all release operations.
Assign to users who define and manage release pipelines.
Note
The Release Administrator group gets created at the same time the first release pipeline is defined. It isn't created by default when the project is created.
TeamName
Has permissions to contribute fully to the project code base and work item tracking.
The default Team group is created when you create a project, and by default is added to the Contributors group for the project. Any new teams you create also have a group created for them and added to the Contributors group.
Add members of the team to this group. To grant access to configure team settings,add a team member to the team administrator role.
Team administrator role
For each team that you add, you can assign one or more team members as administrators. The team admin role isn't a group with a set of defined permissions. Instead, the team admin role is tasked with managing  team assets. For more information, seeManage teams and configure team tools. To add a user as a team administrator, seeAdd a team administrator.
Note
Project Administrators can manage all team administrative areas for all teams.
Permissions
The system manages permissions at different levelsâorganization, project, object, and role-based permissionsâand by default assigns them to one or more built-in groups. You can manage most permissions through the web portal. Manage more permissions with thecommand line tool (CLI).

Note
To control permissions for specific build definitions, turn offinheritance.
When inheritance is turnedon, the build definition respects the build permissions defined at the project level or a group or user. For example, a custom Build Managers group has permissions set to manually queue a build for project Fabrikam. Any build definition with inheritance for project Fabrikam allows a member of the Build Managers group to manually queue a build.
When inheritance is turnedoff, you can set permissions so only Project Administrators can manually queue a build for a specific build definition.

You can manage these permissions for all Git repositories, or for a specific Git repo.

Note
Set permissions across all Git repositories by making changes to the top-levelGit repositoriesentry. Individual repositories inherit permissions from  the top-levelGit repositoriesentry.

Area path (object-level)
Area path permissions manage access to branches of the area hierarchy and to the work items in those areas. Manage the security of each area path from theweb portalor using theTFSSecurity command-line tool. Area permissions manage access to create and manage area paths as well as create and modify work items defined under area paths.
Members of the Project Administrators group are automatically granted permissions to manage area paths for a project. Consider granting team administrators or team leads permissions to create, edit, or delete area nodes.
Note
Multiple teams can contribute to a project.
When that's the case, you can set up teams that are associated with an area.
Permissions for the team's work items are assigned by assigning permissions to the area.

Tagging, Create
Can create new tags and apply them to work items.Users without this permission can only select from the existing set of tags for the project.
By default, Contributors are assigned theCreate tag definitionpermission. Although theCreate tag definitionpermission appears in the security settings at the project-level, tagging permissions are actually collection-level permissions that are scoped at the project level when they appear in the user interface. To scope tagging permissions to a single project when you're using a command-line tool, you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax. Otherwise, your change applies to the entire collection. Keep this in mind when changing or setting these permissions.
Delete tag definitionTagging, Delete
Tagging, Delete
Can remove a tag from the list of available tags for that project.
This permission doesn't appear in the UI. You can only set it by using a command-line tool. There's also no UI to explicitly delete a tag. Instead, when a tag has not been in use for three days, the system automatically deletes it.

Release (object-level)
Manage permissionsfor each release defined in the web portal. Project Administrators and Release Administrators are granted all release management permissions. These permissions work in a hierarchical model at the project level, for a specific release pipeline, or for a specific environment in a release pipeline. Within this hierarchy, permissions can be inherited from the parent or overridden.

Note
The project-level Release Administrator's group gets created when you define your first release pipeline.
In addition, you can assign approvers to specific steps within a release pipeline to ensure that the applications being deployed meet quality standards.
The following permissions are defined in Release Management. The scope column explains whether the permission can be set at the project, release pipeline, or environment level.
