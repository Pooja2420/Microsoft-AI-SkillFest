This quickstart describes how to create a Traffic Manager profile that delivers high availability for your web application.
In this quickstart, you'll read about two instances of a web application. Each of them is running in a different Azure region. You'll create a Traffic Manager profile based onendpoint priority. The profile directs user traffic to the primary site running the web application. Traffic Manager continuously monitors the web application. If the primary site is unavailable, it provides automatic failover to the backup site.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountnow.
Prerequisites
For this quickstart, you'll need two instances of a web application deployed in two different Azure regions (East USandWest Europe). Each will serve as primary and failover endpoints for Traffic Manager.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

Create a Traffic Manager profile

In theCreate Traffic Manager profile, enter, or select these settings:SettingValueNameEnter a unique name for your Traffic Manager profile.Routing methodSelectPriority.SubscriptionSelect the subscription you want the traffic manager profile applied to.Resource groupSelectmyResourceGroupTM1.LocationThis setting refers to the location of the resource group. It has no effect on the Traffic Manager profile that will be deployed globally.
In theCreate Traffic Manager profile, enter, or select these settings:

SelectCreate.
SelectCreate.
Add Traffic Manager endpoints
Add the website in theEast USas primary endpoint to route all the user traffic. Add the website inWest Europeas a failover endpoint. When the primary endpoint is unavailable, traffic automatically routes to the failover endpoint.
In the portal's search bar, enter the Traffic Manager profile name that you created in the preceding section.

InTraffic Manager profile, in theSettingssection, selectEndpoints, and then selectAdd.

Enter, or select, these settings:SettingValueTypeSelectAzure endpoint.NameEntermyPrimaryEndpoint.Target resource typeSelectApp Service.Target resourceSelectChoose an app service>East US.PrioritySelect1. All traffic goes to this endpoint when it's healthy.
Enter, or select, these settings:

SelectAdd.
SelectAdd.
To create a failover endpoint for your second Azure region, repeat steps 3 and 4 with these settings:SettingValueTypeSelectAzure endpoint.NameEntermyFailoverEndpoint.Target resource typeSelectApp Service.Target resourceSelectChoose an app service>West Europe.PrioritySelect2. All traffic goes to this failover endpoint if the primary endpoint is unhealthy.
To create a failover endpoint for your second Azure region, repeat steps 3 and 4 with these settings:
SelectAdd.
SelectAdd.
When you're done adding the two endpoints, they're displayed inTraffic Manager profile. Notice that their monitoring status isOnlinenow.
Test Traffic Manager profile
In this section, you'll check the domain name of your Traffic Manager profile. You'll also configure the primary endpoint to be unavailable. Finally, you get to see that the web app is still available. It's because Traffic Manager sends the traffic to the failover endpoint.
Check the DNS name
In the portalâs search bar, search for theTraffic Manager profilename that you created in the preceding section.
