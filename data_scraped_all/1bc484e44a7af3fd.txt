There are a few things you need to prepare before using Managed DevOps Pools for the first time.
At a high level, you need:
An Azure account with an active subscription, with the Managed DevOps Pools resource provider registered
An Azure DevOps organization, connected to the Microsoft Entra ID tenant of the users who will be administering the Managed DevOps Pool
Permissions in the Azure DevOps organization to create a Managed DevOps Pool
This article shows you how to configure your Azure subscription and Azure DevOps organization for use with Managed DevOps Pools. These configuration steps only need to be performed a single time per Azure DevOps organization and Azure subscription.
Configure your Azure subscription
Register the Managed DevOps Pools resource provider in your Azure Subscription
Review Managed DevOps Pools quotas
Create a dev center and dev center project(If you plan to create your Managed DevOps Pools using the Azure portal, you can create the dev center and dev center project during the pool creation process.)
Register the Managed DevOps Pools resource provider in your Azure Subscription
To use Managed DevOps Pools, register the following resource providers with your Azure subscription.
Registering a resource provider uses the/register/actionoperation. Permission to perform this operation is included if your account is assigned thecontributor or owner roleon your subscription.
/register/action

Azure CLI
If you prefer using Azure CLI to register the Azure Resource Provider, run the following command usingAzure CLI.
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.DevCenter'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.DevCenter'
PowerShell
If you prefer using PowerShell to register the Azure Resource Provider, run the following command using theAz.Resources module.
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure'
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.DevCenter'
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure'
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.DevCenter'

Review Managed DevOps Pools quotas
Managed DevOps Pools usesAzure Quotasto manage the usage of the virtual machine resources that run your agents. Managed DevOps Pools quotas are based on CPU cores per Azure VM SKU family. By default, regions that support Managed DevOps Pools have five cores of quota granted for the followingSKU families.

standardDADSv5Family

The default agent size for new Managed DevOps Pools resources isStandard D2ads v5, which is part of thestandardDADSv5Family.Standard D2ads v5uses two cores, so you can create a pool with up to two agents, for a total of four cores, without requesting additional quota. To create more, you mustrequest a quota adjustment.
To view the quotas for SKU families in your region, sign in to theAzure portal, enterquotasin the search box, and chooseQuotasfrom the list.

Choose your subscription and the region where you want to create the pool. In the following example, theStandard DADSv5 Family vCPUsquota is8 of 8, which means eight cores are available, but all eight are being used. If you want to use more than eight cores for this SKU, or you want to use a different SKU that doesn't have any quota, you can request a quota adjustment.

Create a dev center and dev center project
Managed DevOps Pools requires a dev center and dev center project. You have the option to create a dev center and dev center project when you create your pool in the Azure portal, but if you want to create them ahead of time, perform the following steps.
Create a dev center
Create a dev center Project
Multiple Managed DevOps Pools can use the same dev center and dev center project, and the dev center project isn't required to be in the same region or the same subscription as your Managed DevOps Pool.

Configure your Azure DevOps organization
Connect your Azure DevOps organization to Microsoft Entra ID and verify membership
Verify Azure DevOps permissions
Connect your Azure DevOps organization to Microsoft Entra ID and verify membership
To create a Managed DevOps Pool in your Azure DevOps organization, your Azure DevOps organization must be connected to Microsoft Entra ID, and your user account must be a member of the following Microsoft Entra IDtenants:
The tenant of the Azure subscription that contains your Managed DevOps Pool
The tenant your Azure DevOps organization is connected to
View your current directory (Azure tenant) in the Azure portal.
View the tenant for your Azure DevOps organization. You can go directly to this page in the Azure DevOps portal here:https://dev.azure.com/<your-organization>/_settings/organizationAad.
https://dev.azure.com/<your-organization>/_settings/organizationAad
If your Azure DevOps organization isn't connected to Microsoft Entra ID, follow the steps inConnect your organization to Microsoft Entra IDand connect to the desired tenant, such as the same tenant as your Azure subscription.
Verify Azure DevOps permissions
When you create a Managed DevOps Pool, the account you use to sign in to the Azure subscription that contains your Managed DevOps Pool is used to create a corresponding agent pool in your Azure DevOps organization. To successfully create a Managed DevOps Pool, your account must have one of the following permissions in your Azure DevOps organization. These permissions are listed in order from least privileged to most privileged.
