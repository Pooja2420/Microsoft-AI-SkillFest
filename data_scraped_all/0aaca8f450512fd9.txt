Azure Repos
Source or version control systems are pivotal for developers who need to collaborate seamlessly on codebases and maintain a comprehensive history of changes. These systems are indispensable for projects that involve multiple developers and ensure consistency and coordination throughout the development process.

Azure DevOps supports two primary types of source control to suit diverse project needs:GitandTeam Foundation Version Control (TFVC).
Git
Git is a version control system where each developer has a local copy of the entire repository. This approach allows for offline work and easy branching and merging. Git is the default choice for new projects and is recommended for its flexibility and robustness.
Note
Git in Azure DevOps is standard Git. You can use Visual Studio with third-party Git services. You can also use third-party Git clients with Azure DevOps Server.
You can do the following tasks with Azure Repos for Git:
Review files: Examine the details and history of changes made to each file within your repository.
Download and edit files: Obtain a local copy of files from the repository and make necessary modifications.
Manage commits: Keep track of commits pushed to the repository and ensure a clear history of code changes.
Use pull requests: Participate in the collaborative code review process by creating, approving, commenting on, and completing pull requests.
Use Git tags: Organize and mark specific points in your repository's history by using Git tags for easy reference.
TFVC
Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) is a centralized version control system that simplifies code management. Developers work with a single version of each file on their local machines, while the server retains the full history of changes, providing a single source of truth.
TFVC includes the following key features:
Single version workflow: Each developer's machine holds the current version of files. This approach reduces complexity and ensures consistency across the team.
Server-side history: All historical data including changes and versions are securely stored on the server, which preserves the integrity of your project's evolution.
Path-based branching: Branches are created and managed on the server by using a path-based approach. This approach allows for clear organization and straightforward merging processes.
Azure Pipelines
Achieving rapid and reliable software releases is a hallmark of modern development practices. Azure Pipelines stands at the forefront of this endeavor by automating the build, test, and release processes.
