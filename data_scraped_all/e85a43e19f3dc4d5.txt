A persistent volume represents a piece of storage that has been provisioned for use with Kubernetes pods. A persistent volume can be used by one or many pods, and it can be statically or dynamically provisioned. This article shows you how to configureAzure NetApp Filesto be used by pods on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
Azure NetApp Filesis an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file storage service running on Azure and supports volumes usingNFS(NFSv3 or NFSv4.1),SMB, anddual-protocol(NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB). Kubernetes users have two options for using Azure NetApp Files volumes for Kubernetes workloads:
Create Azure NetApp Files volumesstatically. In this scenario, the creation of volumes is external to AKS. Volumes are created using the Azure CLI or from the Azure portal, and are then exposed to Kubernetes by the creation of aPersistentVolume. Statically created Azure NetApp Files volumes have many limitations (for example, inability to be expanded, needing to be over-provisioned, and so on). Statically created volumes aren't recommended for most use cases.
PersistentVolume
Create Azure NetApp Files volumesdynamically, orchestrating through Kubernetes. This method is thepreferredway to create multiple volumes directly through Kubernetes, and is achieved usingTrident. Trident is a CSI-compliant dynamic storage orchestrator that helps provision volumes natively through Kubernetes.
Note
Dual-protocol volumes can only be createdstatically. For more information on using dual-protocol volumes with Azure Kubernetes Service, seeProvision Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service.
Using a CSI driver to directly consume Azure NetApp Files volumes from AKS workloads is the recommended configuration for most use cases. This requirement is accomplished using Trident, an open-source dynamic storage orchestrator for Kubernetes. Trident is an enterprise-grade storage orchestrator purpose-built for Kubernetes, and fully supported by NetApp. It simplifies access to storage from Kubernetes clusters by automating storage provisioning.
You can take advantage of Trident's Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Azure NetApp Files to abstract underlying details and create, expand, and snapshot volumes on-demand.
Important
Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.
For example, theRay GitHub repositorydescribes several platforms that vary in response time, purpose, and support level.
Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, seeVulnerability management for AKSandAKS support coverage.
Before you begin
The following considerations apply when you use Azure NetApp Files:
Your AKS cluster must bein a region that supports Azure NetApp Files.
The Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher installed and configured. Runaz --versionto find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, seeInstall Azure CLI.
az --version
After the initial deployment of an AKS cluster, you can choose to provision Azure NetApp Files volumes statically or dynamically.
To use dynamic provisioning with Azure NetApp Files with Network File System (NFS), install and configureTridentversion 19.07 or higher. To use dynamic provisioning with Azure NetApp Files with Secure Message Block (SMB), install and configure Trident version 22.10 or higher. Dynamic provisioning for SMB shares is only supported on windows worker nodes.
Before you deploy Azure NetApp Files SMB volumes, you must identify the AD DS integration requirements for Azure NetApp Files to ensure that Azure NetApp Files is well connected to AD DS. For more information, seeUnderstand guidelines for Active Directory Domain Services site design and planning. Both the AKS cluster and Azure NetApp Files must have connectivity to the same AD.
