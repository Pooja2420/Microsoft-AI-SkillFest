Controlling outbound network access is an important part of an overall network security plan. For example, you might want to limit access to web sites. Or, you might want to limit the outbound IP addresses and ports that can be accessed.
One way you can control outbound network access from an Azure subnet is with Azure Firewall. With Azure Firewall, you can configure:
Application rules that define fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that can be accessed from a subnet.
Network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port, and destination address.
Network traffic is subjected to the configured firewall rules when you route your network traffic to the firewall as the subnet default gateway.
For this article, you create a simplified single virtual network with two subnets for easy deployment.
For production deployments, ahub and spoke modelis recommended, where the firewall is in its own virtual network. The workload servers are in peered virtual networks in the same region with one or more subnets.
AzureFirewallSubnet- the firewall is in this subnet.
Workload-SN- the workload server is in this subnet. This subnet's network traffic goes through the firewall.

In this article, you learn how to:
Set up a test network environment
Deploy a firewall
Create a default route
Configure an application rule to allow access towww.google.com
Configure a network rule to allow access to external DNS servers
Configure a NAT rule to allow a remote desktop to the test server
Test the firewall
Note
This article uses classic Firewall rules to manage the firewall. The preferred method is to useFirewall Policy. To complete this procedure using Firewall Policy, seeTutorial: Deploy and configure Azure Firewall and policy using the Azure portal
If you prefer, you can complete this procedure usingAzure PowerShell.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Set up the network
First, create a resource group to contain the resources needed to deploy the firewall. Then create a virtual network, subnets, and a test server.
Create a resource group
The resource group contains all the resources used in this procedure.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groupsor search for and selectResource groupsfrom any page. Then selectCreate.
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource groupname, typeTest-FW-RG.
ForRegion, select a region. All other resources that you create must be in the same region.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Create a virtual network
This virtual network has two subnets.
Note
The size of the AzureFirewallSubnet subnet is /26. For more information about the subnet size, seeAzure Firewall FAQ.
On the Azure portal menu or from theHomepage, search forVirtual networks.
SelectVirtual networksin the result pane.
SelectCreate.
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource group, selectTest-FW-RG.
ForVirtual network name, typeTest-FW-VN.
ForRegion, select the same region that you used previously.
SelectNext.
On theSecuritytab, selectEnable Azure Firewall.
ForAzure Firewall name, typeTest-FW01.
ForAzure Firewall public IP address, selectCreate a public IP address.
ForName, typefw-pipand selectOK.
SelectNext.
ForAddress space, accept the default10.0.0.0/16.
UnderSubnets, selectdefaultand change theNametoWorkload-SN.
ForStarting address, change it to10.0.2.0/24.
SelectSave.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
Note
Azure Firewall uses public IPs as needed based on available ports. After randomly selecting a public IP to connect outbound from, it will only use the next available public IP after no more connections can be made from the current public IP. In scenarios with high traffic volume and throughput, it's recommended to use a NAT Gateway to provide outbound connectivity. SNAT ports are dynamically allocated across all public IPs associated with NAT Gateway. To learn more, seeScale SNAT ports with Azure NAT Gateway.
Create a virtual machine
Now create the workload virtual machine, and place it in theWorkload-SNsubnet.
On the Azure portal menu or from theHomepage, selectCreate a resource.

Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Examine the firewall
Go to the resource group and select the firewall.
Note the firewall private and public IP addresses. You use these addresses later.
Create a default route
When you create a route for outbound and inbound connectivity through the firewall, a default route to 0.0.0.0/0 with the virtual appliance private IP as a next hop is sufficient. This directs any outgoing and incoming connections through the firewall. As an example, if the firewall is fulfilling a TCP-handshake and responding to an incoming request, then the response is directed to the IP address who sent the traffic. This is by design.
As a result, there's no need create another user defined route to include the AzureFirewallSubnet IP range. This might result in dropped connections. The original default route is sufficient.
For theWorkload-SNsubnet, configure the outbound default route to go through the firewall.
On the Azure portal, search forRoute tables.
SelectRoute tablesin the results pane.
SelectCreate.
ForSubscription, select your subscription.
ForResource group, selectTest-FW-RG.
ForRegion, select the same location that you used previously.
ForName, typeFirewall-route.
SelectReview + create.
SelectCreate.
After deployment completes, selectGo to resource.

On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groupsor search for and selectResource groupsfrom any page. Select theTest-FW-RGresource group.
Select the network interface for theSrv-Workvirtual machine.
UnderSettings, selectDNS servers.
UnderDNS servers, selectCustom.

SelectSave.
Restart theSrv-Workvirtual machine.
Test the firewall
Now, test the firewall to confirm that it works as expected.
Connect a remote desktop to the firewall public IP address and sign in to the Srv-Work virtual machine.
Connect a remote desktop to the firewall public IP address and sign in to the Srv-Work virtual machine.
Open Internet Explorer and browse tohttps://www.google.com.

https://www.microsoft.com
The firewall should block you.
So now you verified that the firewall rules are working:
You can connect to the virtual machine using RDP.
You can browse to the one allowed FQDN, but not to any others.
You can resolve DNS names using the configured external DNS server.
Clean up resources
You can keep your firewall resources to continue testing, or if no longer needed, delete theTest-FW-RGresource group to delete all firewall-related resources.
