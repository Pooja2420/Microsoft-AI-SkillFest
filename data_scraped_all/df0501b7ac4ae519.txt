In this article
Azure file shares can be mounted in Linux distributions using either the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol or the Network File System (NFS) protocol. This article is focused on mounting with NFS. For details on mounting SMB file shares, seeUse Azure Files with Linux. For details on each of the available protocols, seeAzure file share protocols.
Applies to
Support
Currently, only NFS version 4.1 is supported. NFS 4.1 shares are only supported within theFileStoragestorage account type (premium file shares only).
NFS Azure file shares support most features from the 4.1 protocol specification. Some features such as delegations and callback of all kinds, Kerberos authentication, and encryption-in-transit aren't supported.
Regional availability
NFS file shares are supported in all the same regions that support SSD file shares. SeeAzure Files redundancy support for SSD file shares.
Step 1: Configure network security
NFS file shares can only be accessed from trusted networks. Currently, the only way to secure the data in your storage account is by using a virtual network and other network security settings. Any other tools used to secure data, including account key authorization, Microsoft Entra security, and access control lists (ACLs) can't be used to authorize an NFSv4.1 request.
Important
The NFSv4.1 protocol runs on port 2049. If you're connecting from an on-premises network, make sure that your client allows outgoing communication through port 2049. If you grant access to specific VNets, make sure that any network security groups associated with those VNets don't contain security rules that block incoming communication through port 2049.
Create a private endpoint or service endpoint
To use NFS Azure file shares, you must eithercreate a private endpoint(recommended) orrestrict access to your public endpoint.
Disable secure transfer
Azure Files doesn't currently support encryption-in-transit with the NFS protocol and relies instead on network-level security. Therefore, you need to disable secure transfer on your storage account.

Enable hybrid access through VPN or ExpressRoute (optional)
To enable hybrid access to an NFS Azure file share, use one of the following networking solutions:
Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN.
Configure a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.
ConfigureExpressRoute.
Step 2: Mount an NFS Azure file share
You can mount the share using the Azure portal. You can also create a record in the/etc/fstabfile to automatically mount the share every time the Linux server or VM boots.

Once the file share is created, select the share and selectConnect from Linux.

The NFS file share is now mounted.
Mount an NFS share using /etc/fstab
If you want the NFS file share to automatically mount every time the Linux server or VM boots, create a record in the/etc/fstabfile for your Azure file share. ReplaceYourStorageAccountNameandFileShareNamewith your information.
YourStorageAccountName
FileShareName
<YourStorageAccountName>.file.core.windows.net:/<YourStorageAccountName>/<FileShareName> /media/<YourStorageAccountName>/<FileShareName> nfs vers=4,minorversion=1,_netdev,nofail,sec=sys 0 0
<YourStorageAccountName>.file.core.windows.net:/<YourStorageAccountName>/<FileShareName> /media/<YourStorageAccountName>/<FileShareName> nfs vers=4,minorversion=1,_netdev,nofail,sec=sys 0 0
For more information, enter the commandman fstabfrom the Linux command line.
man fstab

The following mount options are recommended or required when mounting NFS Azure file shares.

Step 3: Validate connectivity
If your mount fails, it's possible that your private endpoint wasn't set up correctly or isn't accessible. For details on confirming connectivity, seeVerify connectivity.
NFS file share snapshots
Customers using NFS Azure file shares can take file share snapshots. This capability allows users to roll back entire file systems or recover files that were accidentally deleted or corrupted. SeeUse share snapshots with Azure Files.
