The Azure CLI is Azure's command-line experience for managing Azure resources. You can use it in your browser with Azure Cloud Shell. You can also install it on macOS, Linux, or Windows and run it from the command line.
In this quickstart, you learn how to create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace by using the Azure CLI.
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Download and installjq, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use.

After it's deployed, more permissions are required:In the Azure portal, assign other users of the workspace to the Contributor role in the workspace. For more information, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.Assign other users the appropriateAzure Synapse Analytics role-based access control rolesby using Synapse Studio.A member of the Owner role of the Azure Storage account must assign the Storage Blob Data Contributor role to the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace managed service identity and other users.

Clean up resources
Follow these steps to delete the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
Warning
Deleting an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace removes the analytics engines and the data stored in the database of the contained SQL pools and workspace metadata. It will no longer be possible to connect to the SQL or Apache Spark endpoints. All code artifacts will be deleted (queries, notebooks, job definitions, and pipelines).
Deleting the workspace won't affect the data in the Data Lake Storage Gen2 account linked to the workspace.
If you want to delete the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, complete the following command:
az synapse workspace delete --name $SynapseWorkspaceName --resource-group $SynapseResourceGroup
az synapse workspace delete --name $SynapseWorkspaceName --resource-group $SynapseResourceGroup
