APPLIES TO: Developer | Premium
Azure API Management can be deployed (injected) inside an Azure virtual network (VNet) to access backend services within the network. For VNet connectivity options, requirements, and considerations, see:
Using a virtual network with Azure API Management
Network resource requirements for API Management injection into a virtual network
This article explains how to set up VNet connectivity for your API Management instance in theinternalmode. In this mode, you can only access the following API Management endpoints within a VNet whose access you control.
The API gateway
The developer portal
Direct management
Git
Note
None of the API Management endpoints are registered on the public DNS. The endpoints remain inaccessible until youconfigure DNSfor the VNet.
To use the self-hosted gateway in this mode, also enable private connectivity to the self-hosted gatewayconfiguration endpoint.
Use API Management in internal mode to:
Make APIs hosted in your private datacenter securely accessible by third parties outside of it by using Azure VPN connections or Azure ExpressRoute.
Enable hybrid cloud scenarios by exposing your cloud-based APIs and on-premises APIs through a common gateway.
Manage your APIs hosted in multiple geographic locations, using a single gateway endpoint.

For configurations specific to theexternalmode, where the API Management endpoints are accessible from the public internet, and backend services are located in the network, seeDeploy your Azure API Management instance to a virtual network - external mode.
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.
Important
Changes to your API Management service's infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration.
While the service is updating, other service infrastructure changes can't be made. However, you can configure APIs, products, policies, and user settings. The service will not experience gateway downtime (except in the Developer tier).
Prerequisites
Review thenetwork resource requirements for API Management injection into a virtual networkbefore you begin.
Some prerequisites differ depending on the version (stv2orstv1) of thecompute platformhosting your API Management instance.

Configure NSG rules
Configure custom network rules in the API Management subnet to filter traffic to and from your API Management instance. We recommend the followingminimumNSG rules to ensure proper operation and access to your instance. Review your environment carefully to determine more rules that might be needed.
Important
Depending on your use of caching and other features, you may need to configure additional NSG rules beyond the minimum rules in the following table. For detailed settings, seeVirtual network configuration reference.
For most scenarios, use the indicatedservice tagsinstead of service IP addresses to specify network sources and destinations.
Set the priority of these rules higher than that of the default rules.

DNS configuration
In internal VNet mode, you have to manage your own DNS to enable inbound access to your API Management endpoints.
We recommend:
Configure an AzureDNS private zone.
Link the Azure DNS private zone to the VNet into which you've deployed your API Management service.
Learn how toset up a private zone in Azure DNS.
Note
The API Management service does not listen to requests on its IP addresses. It only responds to requests to the hostname configured on its endpoints. These endpoints include:
API gateway
The Azure portal
The developer portal
Direct management endpoint
Git
Access on default host names
When you create an API Management service (contosointernalvnet, for example), the following endpoints are configured by default:
contosointernalvnet
contosointernalvnet.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.portal.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.developer.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.management.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.scm.azure-api.net
Access on custom domain names
If you don't want to access the API Management service with the default host names, set upcustom domain namesfor all your endpoints, as shown in the following image:

Configure DNS records
Create records in your DNS server to access the endpoints accessible from within your VNet. Map the endpoint records to theprivate virtual IP addressfor your service.
For testing purposes, you might update the hosts file on a virtual machine in a subnet connected to the VNet in which API Management is deployed. Assuming theprivate virtual IP addressfor your service is 10.1.0.5, you can map the hosts file as follows. The hosts mapping file is at%SystemDrive%\drivers\etc\hosts(Windows) or/etc/hosts(Linux, macOS).
%SystemDrive%\drivers\etc\hosts
/etc/hosts
contosointernalvnet.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.portal.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.developer.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.management.azure-api.net
contosointernalvnet.scm.azure-api.net
You can then access all the API Management endpoints from the virtual machine you created.
Routing
The following virtual IP addresses are configured for an API Management instance in an internal virtual network.
The load-balanced public and private IP addresses can be found on theOverviewblade in the Azure portal.
For more information and considerations, seeIP addresses of Azure API Management.
VIP and DIP addresses
Dynamic IP (DIP) addresses will be assigned to each underlying virtual machine in the service and used to access endpoints and resources in the VNet and in peered VNets. The API Management service's public virtual IP (VIP) address will be used to access public-facing resources.
If IP restriction lists secure resources within the VNet or peered VNets, we recommend specifying the entire subnet range where the API Management service is deployed to grant or restrict access from the service.
Learn more about therecommended subnet size.
If you deploy 1capacity unitof API Management in the Premium tier in an internal VNet, 3 IP addresses will be used: 1 for the private VIP and one each for the DIPs for two VMs. If you scale out to 4 units, more IPs will be consumed for additional DIPs from the subnet.
If the destination endpoint has allow-listed only a fixed set of DIPs, connection failures will result if you add new units in the future. For this reason and since the subnet is entirely in your control, we recommend allow-listing the entire subnet in the backend.
Force tunnel traffic to on-premises firewall using ExpressRoute or network virtual appliance
Forced tunneling lets you redirect or "force" all internet-bound traffic from your subnet back to on-premises for inspection and auditing. Commonly, you configure and define your own default route (0.0.0.0/0), forcing all traffic from the API Management subnet to flow through an on-premises firewall or to a network virtual appliance. This traffic flow breaks connectivity with API Management, since outbound traffic is either blocked on-premises, or NAT'd to an unrecognizable set of addresses that no longer work with various Azure endpoints. You can solve this issue via the following methods:
0.0.0.0/0
Enableservice endpointson the subnet in which the API Management service is deployed for:Azure SQL (required only in the primary region if the API Management service is deployed tomultiple regions)Azure StorageAzure Event HubsAzure Key Vault (required when API Management is deployed on thestv2platform)By enabling endpoints directly from the API Management subnet to these services, you can use the Microsoft Azure backbone network, providing optimal routing for service traffic. If you use service endpoints with a force tunneled API Management, traffic for the preceding Azure services isn't force tunneled. However, the other API Management service dependency traffic remains force tunneled. Ensure that your firewall or virtual appliance doesn't block this traffic, or the API Management service may not function properly.NoteWe strongly recommend enabling service endpoints directly from the API Management subnet to dependent services such as Azure SQL and Azure Storage that support them. However, some organizations may have requirements to force tunnel all traffic from the API Management subnet. In this case, ensure that you configure your firewall or virtual appliance to allow this traffic. You will need to allow the completeIP address rangeof each dependent service, and keep this configuration up to date when the Azure infrastructure changes. Your API Management service may also experience latency or unexpected timeouts because of the force tunneling of this network traffic.

All the control plane traffic from the internet to the management endpoint of your API Management service is routed through a specific set of inbound IPs, hosted by API Management, encompassed by theApiManagementservice tag. When the traffic is force tunneled, the responses won't symmetrically map back to these inbound source IPs and connectivity to the management endpoint is lost. To overcome this limitation, configure a user-defined route (UDR) for the ApiManagement service tag with next hop type set to "Internet", to steer traffic back to Azure.NoteAllowing API Management management traffic to bypass an on-premises firewall or network virtual appliance isn't considered a significant security risk. Therecommended configurationfor your API Management subnet allows inbound management traffic on port 3443 only from the set of Azure IP addresses encompassed by the ApiManagement service tag. The recommended UDR configuration is only for the return path of this Azure traffic.

(External VNet mode) Data plane traffic for clients attempting to reach the API Management gateway and developer portal from the internet will also be dropped by default because of asymmetric routing introduced by forced tunneling. For each client that requires access, configure an explicit UDR with next hop type "Internet" to bypass the firewall or virtual network appliance.

Common network configuration issues
This section has moved. SeeVirtual network configuration reference.
Troubleshooting
Unsuccessful initial deployment of API Management service into a subnet
Deploy a virtual machine into the same subnet.
Connect to the virtual machine and validate connectivity to one of each of the following resources in your Azure subscription:Azure Storage blobAzure SQL DatabaseAzure Storage TableAzure Key Vault (for an API Management instance hosted on thestv2platform)
Azure Storage blob
Azure SQL Database
Azure Storage Table
Azure Key Vault (for an API Management instance hosted on thestv2platform)

Important
After validating the connectivity, remove all the resources in the subnet before deploying API Management into the subnet (required when API Management is hosted on thestv1platform).
stv1
Verify network status
After deploying API Management into the subnet, use the portal to check the connectivity of your instance to dependencies, such as Azure Storage.

To address connectivity issues, reviewnetwork configuration settingsand fix required network settings.
Incremental updates
When making changes to your network, refer toNetworkStatus APIto verify that the API Management service hasn't lost access to critical resources. The connectivity status should be updated every 15 minutes.
To apply a network configuration change to the API Management instance using the portal:
In the left-hand menu for your instance, underDeployment and infrastructure, selectNetwork>Virtual network.
SelectApply network configuration.
Resource navigation links
An API Management instance hosted on thestv1compute platform, when deployed into a Resource Manager VNet subnet, reserves the subnet by creating a resource navigation link. If the subnet already contains a resource from a different provider, deployment willfail. Similarly, when you delete an API Management service, or move it to a different subnet, the resource navigation link will be removed.
stv1
Challenges encountered in reassigning API Management instance to previous subnet
VNet lock- When moving an API Management instance back to its original subnet, immediate reassignment may not be possible due to the VNet lock, which takes up to one hour to be removed. If the original subnet has otherstv1platform-based API Management services (cloud service-based), deleting them and waiting is necessary for deploying anstv2platform-based service in the same subnet.
stv1
stv2
Resource group lock- Another scenario to consider is the presence of a scope lock at the resource group level or higher, hindering the Resource Navigation Link Deletion process. To resolve this, remove the scope lock and allow a delay of approximately 4-6 hours for the API Management service to unlink from the original subnet before the lock removal, enabling deployment to the desired subnet.
Troubleshoot connection to Microsoft Graph from inside a VNet
Network connectivity to Microsoft Graph is needed for features including user sign-in to the developer portal using the Microsoft Entra identity provider.
To troubleshoot connectivity to Microsoft Graph from inside a VNet:
Ensure that NSG and other network rules are configured for outbound connectivity from your API Management instance to Microsoft Graph (using theAzureActiveDirectoryservice tag).
Ensure that NSG and other network rules are configured for outbound connectivity from your API Management instance to Microsoft Graph (using theAzureActiveDirectoryservice tag).
Ensure DNS resolution and network access tograph.microsoft.comfrom within the VNet. For example, provision a new VM inside the VNet, connect to it, and try toGET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadatafrom a browser or using cURL, PowerShell, or other tools.
