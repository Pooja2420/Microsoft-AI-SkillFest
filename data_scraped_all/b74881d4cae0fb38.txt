The NCasT4_v3-series virtual machines are powered byNvidia Tesla T4GPUs and AMD EPYC 7V12(Rome) CPUs. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA T4 GPUs with 16 GB of memory each, up to 64 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC 7V12 (Rome) processor cores(base frequency of 2.45 GHz, all-cores peak frequency of 3.1 GHz and single-core peak frequency of 3.3 GHz) and 440 GiB of system memory. These virtual machines are ideal for deploying AI services- such as real-time inferencing of user-generated requests, or for interactive graphics and visualization workloads using NVIDIA's GRID driver and virtual GPU technology. Standard GPU compute workloads based around CUDA, TensorRT, Caffe, ONNX and other frameworks, or GPU-accelerated graphical applications based on OpenGL and DirectX can be deployed economically, with close proximity to users, on the NCasT4_v3 series.

1Temp disk speed often differs between RR (Random Read) and RW (Random Write) operations. RR operations are typically faster than RW operations. The RW speed is usually slower than the RR speed on series where only the RR speed value is listed.
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
