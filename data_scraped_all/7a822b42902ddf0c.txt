Integrate IBM mainframe and midrange message queues with Azure
When using Azure as a modern data platform, you have your choice of platform as a service (PaaS) or infrastructure as a service (IaaS). PaaS provides cloud-native options for data ingestion, transformation, and storage. IaaS gives you greater control over your hybrid infrastructure, starting with the size and type of virtual machines (VM) you choose. With either approach, you can take advantage of a variety of fully managed relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases, storage solutions, and analytics offerings that span proprietary and open-source engines. This example architecture shows both approaches.

Workflow
IBM MQ is the middleware that acts as a loosely coupled link between a mainframe or midrange system and Azure services. Messages are received and sent according to application requirements to communicate with the mainframe application layer.

In a cloud-native approach, Azure Logic Apps uses the MQ connector to exchange messages with IBM MQ. The Scheduler feature orchestrates the Azure workflow, sending and receiving messages atrecurring intervalsof one second.

The MQ connector can send the messages it reads directly to storage through a connector or send them to be transformed first. Logic Apps includes several options for data transformation, such as an inlineJavaScriptruntime that you can use to run simple JavaScript code snippets for data transformation ordata operationsthat perform transformations on JSON, CSV, and HTML table data. You can also create serverless, single-task functions usingAzure Function.

In an IaaS approach, a VM runs Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS) with the BizTalk Adapter for WebSphere MQ. HIS exchanges messages with IBM MQ and exposes orchestration as web service to a custom .NET application.

Components
Azure Logic Appsprovides tools for data orchestration, data integration, and data transformation. It includes hundreds ofconnectorsfor accessing data on-premises or in the cloud. Make sure to test throughput and performance before choosing a data storage connector.
Logic Apps Schedulerprovides triggers for starting and running workflows based on the interval and frequency of recurrence that you specify.
Logic Apps MQ connectorconnects your Logic Apps workflows to an IBM MQ server on-premises or on Azure. Workflows receive and send messages stored in your MQ server. A Microsoft MQ client is also included for communicating with a remote MQ server across a TCP/IP network. You can use the client to connect to IBM WebSphere MQ 7.5, MQ
8.0, and MQ 9.0, 9.1, and 9.2.
Host Integration Server (HIS)can serve as a message integrator through the WebSphere MQ adapter in Microsoft BizTalk Server. A client and server adapter exchange messages between IBM MQ and BizTalk Server. HIS also serves as an MQ listener and can poll the MQ server for messages at intervals you specify.
.NETis a free, open-source development platform used in this example to create an app to pull the data through HIS to the data storage layer. It can also be used to access IBM WebSphere MQ Servers directly through the Microsoft Client for MQ.

Scenario details
A popular approach in digital transformation scenarios is to see whether
existing applications and middleware tiers can run as-is in a hybrid setup where Microsoft Azure serves as the scalable, distributed data platform. This example describes a data-first approach to middleware integration that enables IBM message queues (MQs) running on mainframe or midrange systems to work with Azure services so you can find the best data platform for your workload.

VM-based IaaS. RunningMicrosoft Host Integration Server (HIS)on a VM, you can use a messaging integration component that connects to IBM MQ. You control the data transformation process by creating a .NET application to read and write messages. The application can persist data in the Azure data store of your choice, and you can choose the MQ server's polling interval.

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeMicrosoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
A hybrid datacenter configuration make sense for organizations that are developing their cloud strategies. Connecting to Azure can help bridge the gaps in your datacenter, enhance performance, improve business continuity, and expand your reach globally.
For example, applications on-premises can communicate with a modern data platform on Azure and begin taking advantage of big data analytics or machine learning. If you need a cost-effective storage solution, you can replicate mainframe data, store it on Azure, and keep the data in sync. Azure can also add the scale needed to support online transaction processing (OLTP), batch, and data ingestion systems.
Reliability
Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Reliability.
Azure service-level agreements (SLAs) describe your uptime guarantees. The SLAs for various components can vary. For example, Azure Logic Apps will be available at least 99.9 percent of the time. Configuration settings you choose can improve SLA.
Cost Optimization
Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Cost Optimization.

In this example architecture, Logic Apps connectors can be used to send messages directly toAzure StorageandAzure Data Lake Storage. For example, Logic Apps includes theAzure Blob Storage connectoras the following figure shows. The connector makes it easy to store massive amounts of unstructured data inAzure Blob Storage. Your data becomes accessible from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. Blob storage also supportsAzure Data Lake Storage Gen2, a big data analytics solution for the cloud. Data is loaded into storage using an Azure service such as theAzCopytool,Azure Data Factory, or another solution that can connect to storage.

Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
Make sure to test the throughput and performance of your data transformation layer before you finalize your architectural approach. Performance depends on several factors, including a workload's message size, latency, and the connectors that are used. Testing helps you find the most compatible target data platform.
