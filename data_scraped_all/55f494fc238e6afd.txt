Microsoft Azure Government uses same underlying technologies as global Azure, which includes the core components ofInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), andSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS). Both Azure and Azure Government have the same comprehensive security controls in place and the same Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data toscreened US persons. These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations.
Note
These lists and tables do not include feature or bundle availability in the Azure Government Secret or Azure Government Top Secret clouds.
For more information about specific availability for air-gapped clouds, please contact your account team.
Export control implications
You're responsible for designing and deploying your applications to meetUS export control requirementssuch as the requirements prescribed in the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810. In doing so, you shouldn't include sensitive or restricted information in Azure resource names, as explained inConsiderations for naming Azure resources.
Guidance for developers
Most of the currently available technical content assumes that applications are being developed on global Azure rather than on Azure Government. For this reason, itâs important to be aware of two key differences in applications that you develop for hosting in Azure Government.
Certain services and features that are in specific regions of global Azure might not be available in Azure Government.
Certain services and features that are in specific regions of global Azure might not be available in Azure Government.
Feature configurations in Azure Government might differ from those in global Azure.
Feature configurations in Azure Government might differ from those in global Azure.
Therefore, it's important to review your sample code and configurations to ensure that you are building within the Azure Government cloud services environment.
For more information, seeAzure Government developer guide.
Note
This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, seeIntroducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module. For Az module installation instructions, seeInstall the Azure Az PowerShell module.
You can use AzureCLI or PowerShell to obtain Azure Government endpoints for services you provisioned:
UseAzure CLIto run theaz cloud showcommand and provideAzureUSGovernmentas the name of the target cloud environment. For example,az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernmentshould get you different endpoints for Azure Government.
UseAzure CLIto run theaz cloud showcommand and provideAzureUSGovernmentas the name of the target cloud environment. For example,
AzureUSGovernment
az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernment
az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernment
should get you different endpoints for Azure Government.
Use aPowerShellcmdlet such asGet-AzEnvironmentto get endpoints and metadata for an instance of Azure service. For example,Get-AzEnvironment -Name AzureUSGovernmentshould get you properties for Azure Government. This cmdlet gets environments from your subscription data file.

Table below lists API endpoints in Azure vs. Azure Government for accessing and managing some of the more common services. If you provisioned a service that isn't listed in the table below, see the Azure CLI and PowerShell examples above for suggestions on how to obtain the corresponding Azure Government endpoint.

Service availability
Microsoft's goal for Azure Government is to match service availability in Azure. For service availability in Azure Government, seeProducts available by region. Services available in Azure Government are listed by category and whether they're Generally Available or available through Preview. If a service is available in Azure Government, that fact isn't reiterated in the rest of this article. Instead, you're encouraged to reviewProducts available by regionfor the latest, up-to-date information on service availability.
In general, service availability in Azure Government implies that all corresponding service features are available to you. Variations to this approach and other applicable limitations are tracked and explained in this article based on the main service categories outlined in theonline directory of Azure services. Other considerations for service deployment and usage in Azure Government are also provided.

Frequently asked questions
Can I migrate data from Azure Monitor logs in Azure to Azure Government?No. It isn't possible to move data or your workspace from Azure to Azure Government.
No. It isn't possible to move data or your workspace from Azure to Azure Government.
Can I switch between Azure and Azure Government workspaces from the Operations Management Suite portal?No. The portals for Azure and Azure Government are separate and don't share information.
No. The portals for Azure and Azure Government are separate and don't share information.
Application Insights (part of Azure Monitor) enables the same features in both Azure and Azure Government. This section describes the supplemental configuration that is required to use Application Insights in Azure Government.
Visual Studioâ In Azure Government, you can enable monitoring on your ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, and Node.js based applications running on Azure App Service. For more information, seeApplication monitoring for Azure App Service overview. In Visual Studio, go to Tools|Options|Accounts|Registered Azure Clouds|Add New Azure Cloud and select Azure US Government as the Discovery endpoint. After that, adding an account in File|Account Settings will prompt you for which cloud you want to add from.
SDK endpoint modificationsâ In order to send data from Application Insights to an Azure Government region, you'll need to modify the default endpoint addresses that are used by the Application Insights SDKs. Each SDK requires slightly different modifications, as described inApplication Insights overriding default endpoints.
Firewall exceptionsâ Application Insights uses several IP addresses. You might need to know these addresses if the app that you're monitoring is hosted behind a firewall. For more information, seeIP addresses used by Azure Monitorfrom where you can download Azure Government IP addresses.
Note
Although these addresses are static, it's possible that we'll need to change them from time to time. All Application Insights traffic represents outbound traffic except for availability monitoring and webhooks, which require inbound firewall rules.
To allow the Application Insights SDK/agent to send data to the Application Insights resource, you need to allow access to the regional endpoint defined in your connection string and open theoutgoing port 443in your firewall. To learn more about the endpoint suffix, seeConnection strings in Application Insights.
