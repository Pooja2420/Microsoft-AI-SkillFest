During your AKS Arc cluster's lifecycle, you might need to directly access cluster nodes for maintenance, log collection, or troubleshooting operations. For security purposes, you must use a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) connection to access Windows or Linux worker nodes. You sign in using the node's IP address.
This article explains how to use SSH to connect to both Windows and Linux nodes.
Use SSH to connect to worker nodes
To access the Kubernetes cluster with the specified permissions, you must retrieve the certificate-based adminkubeconfigfile using theaz aksarc get-credentialscommand. For more information, seeRetrieve certificate-based admin kubeconfig:az aksarc get-credentials --resource-group $<resource_group_name> --name $<aks_cluster_name> --admin
To access the Kubernetes cluster with the specified permissions, you must retrieve the certificate-based adminkubeconfigfile using theaz aksarc get-credentialscommand. For more information, seeRetrieve certificate-based admin kubeconfig:
az aksarc get-credentials --resource-group $<resource_group_name> --name $<aks_cluster_name> --admin
az aksarc get-credentials --resource-group $<resource_group_name> --name $<aks_cluster_name> --admin

Runsshto connect to a worker node:NoteYou must pass the correct location to your SSH private key. The following example uses the default location of~/.ssh/id_rsa, but you might need to change this location if you requested a different path. To change the location, seeConfigure SSH keysto specify the--ssh-key-valueparameter when you create an AKS Arc cluster.For a Linux worker node, run the following command:ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa clouduser@<IP address of the node>For a Windows worker node, run the following command:ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa Administrator@<IP address of the node>

You must pass the correct location to your SSH private key. The following example uses the default location of~/.ssh/id_rsa, but you might need to change this location if you requested a different path. To change the location, seeConfigure SSH keysto specify the--ssh-key-valueparameter when you create an AKS Arc cluster.
--ssh-key-value
For a Linux worker node, run the following command:
ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa clouduser@<IP address of the node>
ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa clouduser@<IP address of the node>
For a Windows worker node, run the following command:
ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa Administrator@<IP address of the node>
ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa Administrator@<IP address of the node>
If you encounter SSH login issues, verify that your IP address is included in the--ssh-auth-ip list. To check this list, runaz aksarc show --name "$<aks_cluster_name>" --resource-group "$<resource_group_name>"and look forauthorizedIpRangesunderclusterVmAccessProfile.
az aksarc show --name "$<aks_cluster_name>" --resource-group "$<resource_group_name>"
