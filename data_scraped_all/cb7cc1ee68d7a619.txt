Azure VMware Solution provides a VMware private cloud environment accessible to users and applications from on-premises and Azure-based environments or resources. Connectivity is delivered through networking services such as Azure ExpressRoute and VPN connections. Specific network address ranges and firewall ports are required to enable these services. This article helps you configure your networking to work with Azure VMware Solution.
In this tutorial, learn about:
Virtual network and ExpressRoute circuit considerations
Routing and subnet requirements
Required network ports to communicate with the services
DHCP and DNS considerations in Azure VMware Solution
Prerequisites
Ensure all gateways, including the ExpressRoute provider's service, support 4-byte Autonomous System Number (ASN). Azure VMware Solution uses 4-byte public ASNs for advertising routes.
Virtual network and ExpressRoute circuit considerations
When you create a virtual network connection in your subscription, the ExpressRoute circuit is established through peering, using an authorization key and a peering ID you request in the Azure portal. The peering is a private, one-to-one connection between your private cloud and the virtual network.
Note
The ExpressRoute circuit is not part of a private cloud deployment. The on-premises ExpressRoute circuit is beyond the scope of this document. If you require on-premises connectivity to your private cloud, use one of your existing ExpressRoute circuits or purchase one in the Azure portal.
When deploying a private cloud, you receive IP addresses for vCenter Server and NSX Manager. To access these management interfaces, create more resources in your subscription's virtual network. Find the procedures for creating those resources and establishingExpressRoute private peeringin the tutorials.
The private cloud logical networking includes a pre-provisioned NSX configuration. A Tier-0 gateway and Tier-1 gateway are pre-provisioned for you. You can create a segment and attach it to the existing Tier-1 gateway or attach it to a new Tier-1 gateway that you define. NSX logical networking components provide East-West connectivity between workloads and North-South connectivity to the internet and Azure services.
Important
If you plan to scale your Azure VMware Solution hosts by usingAzure NetApp Files datastores, deploying the virtual network close to your hosts with an ExpressRoute virtual network gateway is crucial. The closer the storage is to your hosts, the better the performance.
Routing and subnet considerations
The Azure VMware Solution private cloud connects to your Azure virtual network using an Azure ExpressRoute connection. This high bandwidth, low latency connection allows you to access services running in your Azure subscription from your private cloud environment. The routing uses Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is automatically provisioned, and enabled by default for each private cloud deployment.
Azure VMware Solution private clouds require a minimum/22CIDR network address block for subnets. This network complements your on-premises networks, so the address block shouldn't overlap with address blocks used in other virtual networks in your subscription and on-premises networks. Management, vMotion, and Replication networks are provisioned automatically within this address block.
/22
Note
Permitted ranges for your address block are the RFC 1918 private address spaces (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), except for 172.17.0.0/16.
Replication network is not applicable to AV64 nodes and is slated for general deprecation at a future date.
Important
Avoid using the following IP schemas reserved for NSX usage:
169.254.0.0/24 - used for internal transit network
169.254.2.0/23 - used for inter-VRF transit network
100.64.0.0/16 - used to connect T1 and T0 gateways internally

ESXi management/vmotion/replication networks are technically capable of supporting 125 Hosts, however supported max is 96 as 29 are reserved for replacements/maintenance(19) and HCX(10).

This table presents common firewall rules for typical scenarios. However, you might need to consider more items when configuring firewall rules. Note when the source and destination say "on-premises," this information is only relevant if your datacenter has a firewall that inspects flows. If your on-premises components don't have a firewall for inspection, you can ignore those rules.
For more information, see thefull list of VMware HCX port requirements.
DHCP and DNS resolution considerations
Applications and workloads running in a private cloud environment require name resolution and DHCP services for lookup and IP address assignments. A proper DHCP and DNS infrastructure are required to provide these services. You can configure a virtual machine to provide these services in your private cloud environment.
Use the DHCP service built-in to NSX-T Data Center or use a local DHCP server in the private cloud instead of routing broadcast DHCP traffic over the WAN back to on-premises.
Important
If you advertise a default route to the Azure VMware Solution, then you must allow the DNS forwarder to reach the configured DNS servers and they must support public name resolution.
