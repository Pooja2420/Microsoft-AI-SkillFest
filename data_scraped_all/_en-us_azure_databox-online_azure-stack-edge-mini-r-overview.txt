Azure Stack Edge Mini R is an ultra portable, rugged, edge computing device designed for use in harsh environments. Azure Stack Edge Mini R is delivered as a hardware-as-a-service solution. Microsoft ships you a cloud-managed device that acts as network storage gateway and has a built-in Vision Processing Unit (VPU) that enables accelerated AI-inferencing.
This article provides you an overview of the Azure Stack Edge Mini R solution, key capabilities, and the scenarios where you can deploy this device.
Key capabilities
Azure Stack Edge Mini R has the following capabilities:
For information on VM workloads, seeVM overview on Azure Stack Edge.
For containerized workloads, seeKubernetes overview on Azure Stack Edge
Use cases
Here are the various scenarios where Azure Stack Edge Mini R can be used for rapid Machine Learning (ML) inferencing at the edge and preprocessing data before sending it to Azure.
Inference with Azure Machine Learning- With Azure Stack Edge Mini R, you can run ML models to get quick results that can be acted on before the data is sent to the cloud. The full data set can optionally be transferred to continue to retrain and improve your ML models. For more information on how to use the Azure Machine Learning hardware accelerated models on the Azure Stack Edge Mini R device, seeDeploy Azure Machine Learning hardware accelerated models on Azure Stack Edge Mini R.

Preprocess data- Transform data via compute options such as containers or virtual machines before sending it to Azure to create a more actionable dataset. Preprocessing can be used to:Aggregate data.Modify data, for example to remove personal data.Subset data to optimize storage and bandwidth, or for further analysis.Analyze and react to IoT Events.

Components
The Azure Stack Edge Mini R solution comprises an Azure Stack Edge resource, Azure Stack Edge Mini R rugged, ultra portable physical device, and a local web UI.
Azure Stack Edge Mini R physical device- An ultra portable, rugged, compute and storage device supplied by Microsoft. The device has an onboard battery and weighs less than 7 lbs.To procure a device, go to the Azure Edge Hardware Center and place an order. Azure Edge Hardware Center service lets you choose from a variety of Azure Stack Edge SKUs as per your business need. You can order multiple units of a device type, ship multiple devices to different locations, save addresses for future orders, and also track the status of your orders.Once the order is delivered, you can configure your device and create an Azure Stack Edge resource to manage the device.For more information, go toCreate an order for your Azure Stack Edge Mini R device.

Destination Storage accounts- The storage accounts that store the data are available in all Azure regions. The regions where the storage accounts store Azure Stack Edge Mini R data should be located close to where the device is located for optimum performance. A storage account located far from the device results in long latencies and slower performance.
