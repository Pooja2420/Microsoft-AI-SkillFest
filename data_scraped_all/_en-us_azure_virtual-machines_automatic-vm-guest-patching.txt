Enabling automatic guest patching for your Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) and Scale Sets (VMSS) helps ease update management by safely and automatically patching virtual machines to maintain security compliance, while limiting the blast radius of VMs.
Automatic VM guest patching has the following characteristics:
Patches classified asCriticalorSecurityare automatically downloaded and applied on the VM.
Patches are applied during off-peak hours for IaaS VMs in the VM's time zone.
Patches are applied during all hours for VMSS Flex.
Azure manages the patch orchestration and followsavailability-first principles.
Virtual machine health, as determined through platform health signals, is monitored to detect patching failures.
Application health can be monitored through theApplication Health extension.
Works for all VM sizes.
How does automatic VM guest patching work?
If automatic VM guest patching is enabled on a VM, then the availableCriticalandSecuritypatches are downloaded and applied automatically on the VM. This process kicks off automatically every month when new patches are released. Patch assessment and installation are automatic, and the process includes rebooting the VM as configured. The rebootSetting parameter on the VM Model takes precedence over settings in another system, such asMaintenance Configuration.
The VM is assessed periodically every few days and multiple times within any 30-day period to determine the applicable patches for that VM. The patches can be installed any day on the VM during off-peak hours for the VM. This automatic assessment ensures that any missing patches are discovered at the earliest possible opportunity.
Patches are installed within 30 days of the monthly patch releases, following availability-first orchestration. Patches are installed only during off-peak hours for the VM, depending on the time zone of the VM. The VM must be running during the off-peak hours for patches to be automatically installed. If a VM is powered off during a periodic assessment, the platform automatically assess and apply patches (if necessary) during the next periodic assessment (usually within a few days) when the VM is powered on.
Definition updates and other patches not classified asCriticalorSecuritywon't be installed through automatic VM guest patching. To install patches with other patch classifications or schedule patch installation within your own custom maintenance window, you can useUpdate Management.
Enabling Automatic Guest Patching on single-instance VMs or Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Flexible orchestration mode allows the Azure platform to update your fleet in phases. Phased deployment follows Azure'sSafe Deployment Practicesand reduces the impact radius if any issues are identified with the latest update.Health monitoringis recommended for single instance VMs and required for Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Flexible orchestration mode to detect issues any issues with the update.
Availability-first Updates
Azure orchestrates the patch installation process across all public and private clouds for VMs that have enabled Automatic Guest Patching. The orchestration follows availability-first principles across different levels of availability provided by Azure.
For a group of virtual machines undergoing an update, the Azure platform orchestrates updates:
Across regions:
A monthly update is orchestrated across Azure globally in a phased manner to prevent global deployment failures.
A phase can have one or more regions, and an update moves to the next phases only if eligible VMs in a phase update successfully.
Geo-paired regions aren't updated concurrently and can't be in the same regional phase.
The success of an update is measured by tracking the VMâs health post update. VM Health is tracked through platform health indicators for the VM.
Within a region:
VMs in different Availability Zones aren't updated concurrently with the same update.
VMs that aren't part of an availability set are batched on a best effort basis to avoid concurrent updates for all VMs in a subscription.
Within an availability set:
All VMs in a common availability set aren't updated concurrently.
VMs in a common availability set are updated within Update Domain boundaries and VMs across multiple Update Domains aren't updated concurrently.
In an Update Domain, no more than 20% of the VMs within an availability set are be updated at a time. For availability sets with fewer than 10 VMs, VMs update one at a time within an Update Domain.
Restricting the number of concurrently patched VMs across regions, within a region, or within an availability set limits the impact of a faulty patch on a given set of VMs. With health monitoring, any potential issues are flagged before they impact the entire workload.
The patch installation date for a given VM may vary month-to-month, as a specific VM may be picked up in a different batch between monthly patching cycles.
Which patches are installed?
The patches installed depend on the rollout stage for the VM. Every month, a new global rollout is started where all security and critical patches assessed for an individual VM are installed for that VM. The rollout is orchestrated across all Azure regions in batches.
The exact set of patches to be installed vary based on the VM configuration, including OS type, and assessment timing. It's possible for two identical VMs in different regions to get different patches installed if there are more or less patches available when the patch orchestration reaches different regions at different times. Similarly, but less frequently, VMs within the same region but assessed at different times (due to different Availability Zone or Availability Set batches) might get different patches.
As the Automatic VM Guest Patching doesn't configure the patch source, two similar VMs configured to different patch sources, such as public repository vs private repository, may also see a difference in the exact set of patches installed.
For OS types that release patches on a fixed cadence, VMs configured to the public repository for the OS can expect to receive the same set of patches across the different rollout phases in a month. For example, Windows VMs configured to the public Windows Update repository.
As a new rollout is triggered every month, a VM receives at least one patch rollout every month if the VM is powered on during off-peak hours. This process ensures that the VM is patched with the latest available security and critical patches on a monthly basis. To ensure consistency in the set of patches installed, you can configure your VMs to assess and download patches from your own private repositories.
Supported OS images
Important
Automatic VM guest patching, on-demand patch assessment and on-demand patch installation are supported only on VMs created from images with the exact combination of publisher, offer and sku from the below supported OS images list. Custom images or any other publisher, offer, sku combinations aren't supported. More images are added periodically. Don't see your SKU in the list? Request support by filing outImage Support Request.
Supported Windows Images (Hotpatchable)
Supported Windows Images (non-Hotpatchable)
Supported Linux Images
Patch orchestration modes
VMs on Azure now support the following patch orchestration modes:
AutomaticByPlatform (Azure-orchestrated patching):
This mode is supported for both Linux and Windows VMs.
This mode enables automatic VM guest patching for the virtual machine and subsequent patch installation is orchestrated by Azure.
During the installation process, this modeassesses the VMfor available patches and save the details inAzure Resource Graph.
This mode is required for availability-first patching.
This mode is only supported for VMs that are created using the supported OS platform images above.
For Windows VMs, setting this mode also disables the native Automatic Updates on the Windows virtual machine to avoid duplication.
To use this mode on Linux VMs, set the propertyosProfile.linuxConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatformin the VM template.
osProfile.linuxConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatform
To use this mode on Windows VMs, set the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatformin the VM template.
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatform
Enabling this mode sets the Registry Key SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU\NoAutoUpdate to 1
AutomaticByOS:
This mode is supported only for Windows VMs.
This mode enables Automatic Updates on the Windows virtual machine, and patches are installed on the VM through Automatic Updates.
This mode doesn't support availability-first patching.
This mode is set by default if no other patch mode is specified for a Windows VM.
To use this mode on Windows VMs, set the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true, and set the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByOSin the VM template.
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByOS
Enabling this mode sets the Registry Key SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU\NoAutoUpdate to 0
Manual:
This mode is supported only for Windows VMs.
This mode disables Automatic Updates on the Windows virtual machine. When deploying a VM using CLI or PowerShell, setting--enable-auto-updatestofalsealso setspatchModetomanualand disables Automatic Updates.
--enable-auto-updates
false
patchMode
manual
This mode doesn't support availability-first patching.
This mode should be set when using custom patching solutions.
To use this mode on Windows VMs, set the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=false, and set the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=Manualin the VM template.
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=false
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=Manual
Enabling this mode sets the Registry Key SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU\NoAutoUpdate to 1
ImageDefault:
This mode is supported only for Linux VMs.
This mode doesn't support availability-first patching.
This mode honors the default patching configuration in the image used to create the VM.
This mode is set by default if no other patch mode is specified for a Linux VM.
To use this mode on Linux VMs, set the propertyosProfile.linuxConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=ImageDefaultin the VM template.
osProfile.linuxConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=ImageDefault
Note
For Windows VMs, the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdatescan only be set when the VM is first created. This impacts certain patch mode transitions. Switching between AutomaticByPlatform and Manual modes is supported on VMs that haveosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=false. Similarly switching between AutomaticByPlatform and AutomaticByOS modes is supported on VMs that haveosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true. Switching between AutomaticByOS and Manual modes isn't supported.
Azure recommends thatAssessment Modebe enabled on a VM even if Azure Orchestration isn't enabled for patching. This allows the platform to assess the VM every 24 hours for any pending updates, and save the details inAzure Resource Graph. The platform performs assessment to report consolidated results when the machineâs desired patch configuration state is applied or confirmed. This is reported as a âPlatformâ-initated assessment.
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=false
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true
Requirements for enabling automatic VM guest patching
The virtual machine must have the Azure VM Agent forWindowsorLinuxinstalled.
For Linux VMs, the Azure Linux agent must be version 2.2.53.1 or higher.Update the Linux agentif the current version is lower than the required version.
For Windows VMs, the Windows Update service must be running on the virtual machine.
The virtual machine must be able to access the configured update endpoints. If your virtual machine is configured to use private repositories for Linux or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for Windows VMs, the relevant update endpoints must be accessible.
Use Compute API version 2021-03-01 or higher to access all functionality including on-demand assessment and on-demand patching.
Custom images aren't currently supported.
VMSS Flexible Orchestration requires the installation ofApplication Health extension. This is optional for IaaS VMs.
Enable automatic VM guest patching
Automatic VM guest patching can be enabled on any Windows or Linux VM that is created from a supported platform image.

Azure PowerShell when creating a Windows VM
Use theSet-AzVMOperatingSystemcmdlet to enable automatic VM guest patching when creating a VM.
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $VirtualMachine -Windows -ComputerName $ComputerName -Credential $Credential -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate -PatchMode "AutomaticByPlatform"
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $VirtualMachine -Windows -ComputerName $ComputerName -Credential $Credential -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate -PatchMode "AutomaticByPlatform"
Azure PowerShell when updating a Windows VM
Use theSet-AzVMOperatingSystemandUpdate-AzVMcmdlet to enable automatic VM guest patching on an existing VM.
$VirtualMachine = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $VirtualMachine -PatchMode "AutomaticByPlatform"
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VM $VirtualMachine
$VirtualMachine = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $VirtualMachine -PatchMode "AutomaticByPlatform"
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VM $VirtualMachine
Azure CLI for Windows VMs
Useaz vm createto enable automatic VM guest patching when creating a new VM. The following example configures automatic VM guest patching for a VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image Win2019Datacenter --enable-agent --enable-auto-update --patch-mode AutomaticByPlatform
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image Win2019Datacenter --enable-agent --enable-auto-update --patch-mode AutomaticByPlatform
To modify an existing VM, useaz vm update
az vm update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --set osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatform
az vm update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --set osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatform
Azure portal
When creating a VM using the Azure portal, patch orchestration modes can be set under theManagementtab for both Linux and Windows.

Enablement and assessment
Note
It can take more than three hours to enable automatic VM guest updates on a VM, as the enablement is completed during the VM's off-peak hours. As assessment and patch installation occur only during off-peak hours, your VM must be also be running during off-peak hours to apply patches.
When automatic VM guest patching is enabled for a VM, a VM extension of typeMicrosoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtensionis installed on a Linux VM or a VM extension of typeMicrosoft.CPlat.Core.WindowsPatchExtensionis installed on a Windows VM. This extension doesn't need to be manually installed or updated, as this extension is managed by the Azure platform as part of the automatic VM guest patching process.
Microsoft.CPlat.Core.LinuxPatchExtension
Microsoft.CPlat.Core.WindowsPatchExtension
It can take more than three hours to enable automatic VM guest updates on a VM, as the enablement is completed during the VM's off-peak hours. The extension is also installed and updated during off-peak hours for the VM. If the VM's off-peak hours end before enablement can be completed, the enablement process resumes during the next available off-peak time.
The platform makes periodic patching configuration calls to ensure alignment when model changes are detected on IaaS VMs or scale sets in Flexible orchestration. Certain model changes such as, but not limited to, updating assessment mode, patch mode, and extension update may trigger a patching configuration call.
Automatic updates are disabled in most scenarios, and patch installation is done through the extension going forward. The following conditions apply.
If a Windows VM previously had Automatic Windows Update turned on through the AutomaticByOS patch mode, then Automatic Windows Update is turned off for the VM when the extension is installed.
For Ubuntu VMs, the default automatic updates are disabled automatically when Automatic VM Guest Patching completes enablement.
For RHEL, automatic updates need to be manually disabled. Execute:
sudo systemctl stop packagekit
sudo systemctl stop packagekit
sudo systemctl mask packagekit
sudo systemctl mask packagekit
To verify whether automatic VM guest patching has completed and the patching extension is installed on the VM, you can review the VM's instance view. If the enablement process is complete, the extension is installed and the assessment results for the VM are available underpatchStatus. The VM's instance view can be accessed through multiple ways as described below.
patchStatus
REST API
GET on `/subscriptions/subscription_id/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVirtualMachine/instanceView?api-version=2020-12-01`
GET on `/subscriptions/subscription_id/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVirtualMachine/instanceView?api-version=2020-12-01`
Azure PowerShell
Use theGet-AzVMcmdlet with the-Statusparameter to access the instance view for your VM.
-Status
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM" -Status
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM" -Status
PowerShell currently only provides information on the patch extension. Information aboutpatchStatuswill also be available soon through PowerShell.
patchStatus
Azure CLI
Useaz vm get-instance-viewto access the instance view for your VM.
az vm get-instance-view --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
az vm get-instance-view --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Understanding the patch status for your VM
ThepatchStatussection of the instance view response provides details on the latest assessment and the last patch installation for your VM.
patchStatus
The assessment results for your VM can be reviewed under theavailablePatchSummarysection. An assessment is periodically conducted for a VM that has automatic VM guest patching enabled. The count of available patches after an assessment is provided undercriticalAndSecurityPatchCountandotherPatchCountresults. Automatic VM guest patching installs all patches assessed under theCriticalandSecuritypatch classifications. Any other assessed patch is skipped.
availablePatchSummary
criticalAndSecurityPatchCount
otherPatchCount
The patch installation results for your VM can be reviewed under thelastPatchInstallationSummarysection. This section provides details on the last patch installation attempt on the VM, including the number of patches that were installed, pending, failed, or skipped. Patches are installed only during the off-peak hours maintenance window for the VM. Pending and failed patches are automatically retried during the next off-peak hours maintenance window.
lastPatchInstallationSummary
Disable automatic VM guest patching
Automatic VM guest patching can be disabled by changing thepatch orchestration modefor the VM.
To disable automatic VM guest patching on a Linux VM, change the patch mode toImageDefault.
ImageDefault
To enable automatic VM guest patching on a Windows VM, the propertyosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdatesdetermines which patch modes can be set on the VM and this property can only be set when the VM is first created. This impacts certain patch mode transitions:
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates
For VMs that haveosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=false, disable automatic VM guest patching by changing the patch mode toManual.
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=false
Manual
For VMs that haveosProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true, disable automatic VM guest patching by changing the patch mode toAutomaticByOS.
osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true
AutomaticByOS
Switching between AutomaticByOS and Manual modes isn't supported.
Use the examples from theenablementsection above in this article for API, PowerShell and CLI usage examples to set the required patch mode.
On-demand patch assessment
If automatic VM guest patching is already enabled for your VM, a periodic patch assessment is performed on the VM during the VM's off-peak hours. This process is automatic and the results of the latest assessment can be reviewed through the VM's instance view as described earlier in this document. You can also trigger an on-demand patch assessment for your VM at any time. Patch assessment can take a few minutes to complete and the status of the latest assessment is updated on the VM's instance view.
Note
On-demand patch assessment doesn't automatically trigger patch installation. If you have enabled automatic VM guest patching, then the assessed and applicable patches for the VM are installed during the VM's off-peak hours, following the availability-first patching process described earlier in this document.
REST API
Use theAssess PatchesAPI to assess available patches for your virtual machine.
POST on `/subscriptions/subscription_id/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVirtualMachine/assessPatches?api-version=2020-12-01`
POST on `/subscriptions/subscription_id/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVirtualMachine/assessPatches?api-version=2020-12-01`
Azure PowerShell
Use theInvoke-AzVmPatchAssessmentcmdlet to assess available patches for your virtual machine.
Invoke-AzVmPatchAssessment -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMName "myVM"
Invoke-AzVmPatchAssessment -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMName "myVM"
Azure CLI
Useaz vm assess-patchesto assess available patches for your virtual machine.
az vm assess-patches --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
az vm assess-patches --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
On-demand patch installation
If automatic VM guest patching is already enabled for your VM, a periodic patch installation of Security and Critical patches is performed on the VM during the VM's off-peak hours. This process is automatic and the results of the latest installation can be reviewed through the VM's instance view as described earlier in this document.
You can also trigger an on-demand patch installation for your VM at any time. Patch installation can take a few minutes to complete and the status of the latest installation is updated on the VM's instance view.
You can use on-demand patch installation to install all patches of one or more patch classifications. You can also choose to include or exclude specific packages for Linux or specific KB IDs for Windows. When triggering an on-demand patch installation, ensure that you specify at least one patch classification or at least one patch (package for Linux, KB ID for Windows) in the inclusion list.

Strict Safe Deployment on Canonical Images
Microsoft and Canonical have partneredto make it easier for our customers to stay current with Linux OS updates and increase the security and resiliency of their Ubuntu workloads on Azure. By using Canonicalâs snapshot service, Azure now applies the same set of Ubuntu updates consistently to your fleet across regions.
Azure stores the package related updates within the customer repository for up to 90 days, depending on the available space. This allows customers to update their fleet leveraging Strict Safe Deployment for VMs that are up to three months behind on updates.
There's no action required for customers that have enabled Auto Patching. The platform installs a package that is snapped to a point-in-time by default. In the event a snapshot-based update can't be installed, Azure applies the latest package on the VM to ensure the VM remains secure. The point-in-time updates are consistent on all VMs across regions to ensure homogeneity. Customers can view the published date information related to the applied update inAzure Resource Graphand theInstance Viewof the VM.
Image End-of-Life (EOL)
Publishers may no longer support generating new updates for their images after a certain date. This is commonly referred to as End-of-life (EOL) for the image. Azure doesn't recommend using images after their EOL date, since it exposes the service to security vulnerabilities or performance issues. The Azure Guest Patching Service (AzGPS) communicates necessary steps for customers and impacted partners. AzGPS removes the image from the support list after the EOL date. VMs that use an end of life image on Azure might continue to work beyond their date. However, any issues experienced by these VMs aren't eligible for support.
