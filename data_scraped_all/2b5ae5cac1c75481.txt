This article covers how to deploy and configure the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) to Arc-enabled servers through Azure Policy using a custom Policy definition. Using Azure Policy ensures that Azure Monitor is running on your selected Arc-enabled servers and automatically installs the AMA on newly added Arc resources.
Deploying the Azure Monitor Agent through a custom Policy definition involves two main steps:
Selecting an existing or creating a new Data Collection Rule (DCR)

Creating and deploying the Policy definition
Creating and deploying the Policy definition
In this scenario, the Policy definition is used to verify that the AMA is installed on your Arc-enabled servers. It will also install the AMA on newly added machines or on existing machines that don't have the AMA installed.
In order for Azure Monitor to work on a machine, it needs to be associated with a Data Collection Rule. Therefore, you'll need to include the resource ID of the DCR when you create your Policy definition.
Select a Data Collection Rule
Data Collection Rules define the data collection process in Azure Monitor. They specify what data should be collected and where that data should be sent. You'll need to select or create a DCR to be associated with your Policy definition.

Locate theResource IDfield at the top of the window and select the button to copy the resource ID for the DCR to the clipboard. Save this resource ID; you'll need to use it when creating your Policy definition.

Create and deploy the Policy definition
In order for Azure Policy to check if AMA is installed on your Arc-enabled, you'll need to create a custom policy definition that does the following:
Evaluates if new VMs have the AMA installed and the association with the DCR.

Enforces a remediation task to install the AMA and create the association with the DCR on VMs that aren't compliant with the policy.
