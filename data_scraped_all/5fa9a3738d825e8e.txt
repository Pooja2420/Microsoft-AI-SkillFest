Before your applications can interact with Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), they must be registered in a tenant that you manage.
In this article, you learn how to:
Create an Azure AD B2C tenant
Link your tenant to your subscription
Switch to the directory containing your Azure AD B2C tenant
Add the Azure AD B2C resource as aFavoritein the Azure portal
Before you create your Azure AD B2C tenant, you need to take the following considerations into account:
You can create up to20tenants per subscription. This limit help protect against threats to your resources, such as denial-of-service attacks, and is enforced in both the Azure portal and the underlying tenant creation API. If you want to increase this limit, please contactMicrosoft Support.

By default, each tenant can accommodate a total of1.25 millionobjects (user accounts and applications), but you can increase this limit to5.25 millionobjects when you add and verify a custom domain. If you want to increase this limit, please contactMicrosoft Support. However, if you created your tenant beforeSeptember 2022, this limit doesn't affect you, and your tenant will retain the size allocated to it at creation, that's,50 millionobjects.

If you want to reuse a tenant name that you previously tried to delete, but you see the error "Already in use by another directory" when you enter the domain name, you'll need tofollow these steps to fully delete the tenantbefore you try again. You require a role of at leastSubscription Administrator. After deleting the tenant, you might also need to sign out and sign back in before you can reuse the domain name.
