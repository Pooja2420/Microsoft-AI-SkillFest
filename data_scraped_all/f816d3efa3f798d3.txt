Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts onmetrics,logs, and theactivity log.
This article shows you how to create alerts on throttling, capacity, egress, and high server latency. To learn more about creating alerts, seeCreate or edit an alert rule.
For more information about alert types and alerts, seeMonitor Azure Files.

Metrics to use for alerts
The following table lists some example scenarios to monitor and the proper metric to use for the alert:
Tip
If you create an alert and it's too noisy, adjust the threshold value and alert logic.

Throttling alerts for pay-as-you-go file shares will be triggered if any file share within the storage account is throttled, and the alert won't identify which file share was throttled. Because per share metrics aren't available for pay-as-you-go file shares, we recommend using the provisioned v2 model instead of the pay-as-you-go model.
