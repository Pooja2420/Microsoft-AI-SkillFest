Microsoft Power BIis a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, enabling end users to create reports and dashboards by themselves without having to depend on information technology staff or database administrators.
When you use Azure Databricks as a data source with Power BI, you can bring the advantages of Azure Databricks performance and technology beyond data scientists and data engineers to all business users.
Publish to Power BI Online from Azure Databricks
When using Azure Databricks as a data source with Power BI Online, you can create Power BI datasets from tables or schemas directly from the Databricks UI.
Requirements
Your data must be in Unity Catalog, and your compute (cluster) must be Unity Catalog enabled. Hive metastore is not currently supported.

Features and notes
When publishing a schema containing multiple tables, all tables with columns are published. Tables with no columns are not published.
Comments on a tableâs columns in Azure Databricks are copied to the descriptions of corresponding columns in Power BI.
Foreign key relationships are preserved in the published dataset. However, Power BI only supports one active relationship path between any two tables. When multiple paths are present in the schema in Azure Databricks, some of the corresponding relationships in Power BI are set to inactive. You can later change which relationships are active or inactive in the data model view in Power BI.
When using OAuth or an on-premises data gateway, credentials might need to be configured under âData source credentialsâ on the Power BI dataset settings page.
Currently, users can only publish directly to Power BI workspaces in their home tenant. Publishing in tenants where they are guest users is not supported.

Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks
You can connect Power BI Desktop to your Azure Databricks clusters and Databricks SQL warehouses. You can also publish Power BI reports to the Power BI service and enable users to access the underlying Azure Databricks data using single sign-on (SSO), passing along the same Microsoft Entra ID credentials they use to access the report.
Requirements
Power BI Desktop 2.85.681.0 or above. To use data managed by Unity Catalog with Power BI, you must use Power BI Desktop 2.98.683.0 or above (October 2021 release).NotePower BI Desktop requires Windows. An alternative for other operating systems is to run Power BI Desktop on a physical host or a Windows-based virtual machine and then connect to it from your operating system.If you use a version of Power BI Desktop below 2.85.681.0, you also need to install theDatabricks ODBC driverin the same environment as Power BI Desktop.

Access Azure Databricks data source using the Power BI service
When you publish a report to the Power BI service, you connect to Azure Databricks using a personal access token.
In the Power BI service, you can also enable single sign on (SSO) so that users can access reports built using DirectQuery storage mode by passing their Microsoft Entra ID credentials to Azure Databricks.

Automated HTTP proxy detection
Power BI Desktop version 2.104.941.0 and above (May 2022 release) has built-in support for detecting Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration.
Power BI Desktop can automatically detect and use your Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration.
If the proxy server does not provide a CRL distribution point (CDP), Power BI might show the following error message:
Details: "ODBC: ERROR [HY000] [Microsoft][DriverSupport] (1200)
-The revocation status of the certificate or one of the certificates in the certificate chain is unknown."
Details: "ODBC: ERROR [HY000] [Microsoft][DriverSupport] (1200)
-The revocation status of the certificate or one of the certificates in the certificate chain is unknown."
To fix this error, complete the following steps:

Power BI Delta Sharing connector
The Power BI Delta Sharing connector allows users to discover, analyze, and visualize datasets shared with them through theDelta Sharingopen protocol. The protocol enables secure exchange of datasets across products and platforms by leveraging REST and cloud storage.
For connection instructions, seePower BI: Read shared data.
Limitations
The Azure Databricks connector supportsweb proxy. However, automatic proxy settings defined in .pac files arenât supported.
In the Azure Databricks connector, theDatabricks.Querydata source is not supported in combination with DirectQuery mode.
Databricks.Query
The data that the Delta Sharing connector loads must fit into the memory of your machine. To ensure this, the connector limits the number of imported rows to theRow Limitthat was set earlier.
Create a Power BI connection in Unity Catalog for orchestration
You can orchestrate publishing to Power BI with aPower BI task (preview). To create a Power BI task, you must have a connection to Power BI in Unity Catalog to store your Entra credentials.
Note
You must have theCREATE CONNECTIONprivilege in Unity Catalog to create the Power BI connection. If someone else creates the connection, you must have theUSE CONNECTIONprivilege to use the connection in a Power BI task.
CREATE CONNECTION
USE CONNECTION
Step 1: Prepare your credentials
You must prepare credentials for authentication to Power BI. You can choose to useService credential,OAuth Machine to Machine, orOAuth(user to machine) authentication methods.
To create aService credential, seeManage access to external cloud services using service credentials.
You must haveCREATE CONNECTIONprivilege on the service credential.
CREATE CONNECTION
You must add the access connector for the service credential to the Power BI workspace to which you are connecting.
Service principal access must be enabled in the Power BI admin portal. SeeEnable service principals.
To prepareOAuth (Machine to Machine)credentials:
Create an Azure service principal or use an existing one. To create a new Azure service principal from the Azure portal, seeRegister a Microsoft Entra app and create a service principal.
Add the service principal to the Power BI workspace that you are publishing to.
Enable the service principal in the Power BI admin portal. SeeEnable service principals.
Generate a client secret, and save both the client ID and client secret of the principal for use in the next step.
Save the authorization endpoint for use in the next step. The authorization endpoint is in the form:https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize.
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
To prepareOAuth(user to machine) credentials:
Get your authorization endpoint for use in the next step. The authorization endpoint is in the form:https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. If the Power BI workspace is in your home workspace, usecommonas the{tenant_id}.
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
common
{tenant_id}
When creating the connection in the next step, you are prompted to login to your Microsoft account and consent to the Databricks Dataset Publishing Integration Entra App. This Entra app is provided by Azure Databricks and used to access your Power BI workspace on your behalf to read workspace information and create and update semantic models. The specific permissions that are granted areContent.Create,Dataset.ReadWrite.All, andWorkspace.Read.All.
Content.Create
Dataset.ReadWrite.All
Workspace.Read.All
Step 2: Create the connection
Sign in to your Databricks workspace and clickCatalogin the sidebar to open Catalog Explorer.
ClickExternal data, thenConnections, and thenCreate a connection.
On theConnections basicspage of theSet up connectionwizard, enter a user-friendlyConnection name.
Select aConnection typeofPower BI.
ForAuth type, selectService credential,OAuth Machine to MachineorOAuth(user to machine), based on the credentials you prepared previously.
ClickNext.
InStep 2of theSet up connectionwizard, you are prompted for the credential information you prepared.
ClickCreate connection.
This connection can now be used when configuring a Power BI task. If you would like to allow other users to access this connection, grant theUSE CONNECTIONprivilege to those users.
USE CONNECTION
