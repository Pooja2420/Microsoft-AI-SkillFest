Who uses Avere vFXT for Azure?
Avere vFXT can help with all sorts of read-intensive computing tasks:
Visual effects rendering
In media and entertainment, the Avere vFXT cluster can speed up data access for time-critical rendering projects. Because you can add more cache space as well as more compute nodes in Azure, you have the flexibility to handle large projects efficiently.
Life sciences
Avere vFXT lets researchers run secondary analysis workflows in Azure Compute, and access genomic data no matter their location.
In pharmaceutical research, Avere vFXT clusters can expedite drug discovery by helping researchers predict drug-target interactions and analyze research data.
Financial services analytics
An Avere vFXT cluster can help speed up quantitative analysis calculations, which gives financial services companies better insight to make strategic decisions.
Features and specifications
The Avere vFXT system is made up of three or more virtual edge filer nodes, configured in a cluster. It can be situated near the client machines, which mount the cluster instead of mounting the storage directly.
The Avere vFXT cluster caches files as they are requested. Repeated requests can be served from the cache more than 80% of the time.
Compatibility
Compatible with hardware NAS systems from NetApp or Dell EMC Isilon
Compatible with Azure Blob
Uses NFSv3 or SMB2 protocol
