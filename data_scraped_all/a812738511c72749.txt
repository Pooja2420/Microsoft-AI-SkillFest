Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SAP Fiori.
Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SAP Fiori with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
Manage your accounts in one central location.
Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:
A Microsoft Entra user account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you canCreate an account for free.
One of the following roles:Application AdministratorCloud Application AdministratorApplication Owner.
Application Administrator
Cloud Application Administrator
Application Owner.
SAP Fiori single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
Scenario description
In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.
SAP Fiori supportsSPinitiated SSO
Note
For SAP Fiori initiated iFrame Authentication, we recommend using theIsPassiveparameter in the SAML AuthnRequest for silent authentication. For more details of theIsPassiveparameter refer toMicrosoft Entra SAML single sign-oninformation.
Adding SAP Fiori from the gallery
To configure the integration of SAP Fiori into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SAP Fiori from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.
Sign in to theMicrosoft Entra admin centeras at least aCloud Application Administrator.
Browse toEntra ID>Enterprise apps>New application.
In theAdd from the gallerysection, typeSAP Fioriin the search box.
SelectSAP Fiorifrom results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.
Alternatively, you can also use theEnterprise App Configuration Wizard. In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SAP Fiori
Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP Fiori using a test user calledB.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SAP Fiori.
To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP Fiori, perform the following steps:
Configure Microsoft Entra SSO- to enable your users to use this feature.Create a Microsoft Entra test user- to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.Assign the Microsoft Entra test user- to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
Create a Microsoft Entra test user- to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
Assign the Microsoft Entra test user- to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
Configure SAP Fiori SSO- to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.Create SAP Fiori test user- to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP Fiori that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
Create SAP Fiori test user- to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP Fiori that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
Test SSO- to verify whether the configuration works.
