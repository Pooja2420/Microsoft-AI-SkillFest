Global load balancer metrics
This table includes additional information about global metrics from the Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers table:
Note
Bandwidth-related metrics such as SYN packet, byte count, and packet count doesn't capture any traffic to an internal load balancer by using a UDR, such as from an NVA or firewall.
Max and min aggregations are not available for the SYN count, packet count, SNAT connection count, and byte count metrics.
Count aggregation is not recommended for Data path availability and health probe status. Use average instead for best represented health data.

This service has the following dimensions associated with its metrics.
