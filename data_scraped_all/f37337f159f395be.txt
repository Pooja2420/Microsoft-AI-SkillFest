Azure Import/Export protects the BitLocker keys used to lock the drives via an encryption key. By default, BitLocker keys are encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For additional control over encryption keys, you can also provide customer-managed keys.
Customer-managed keys must be created and stored in an Azure Key Vault. For more information about Azure Key Vault, seeWhat is Azure Key Vault?
This article shows how to use customer-managed keys with Import/Export service in theAzure portal.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure:
You have created an import or an export job as per the instructions in:Create an import job for blobs.Create an import job for files.Create an export job for blobs
You have created an import or an export job as per the instructions in:

You have an existing Azure Key Vault with a key in it that you can use to protect your BitLocker key. To learn how to create a key vault using the Azure portal, seeQuickstart: Create an Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal.Soft deleteandDo not purgeare set on your existing Key Vault. These properties are not enabled by default. To enable these properties, see the sections titledEnabling soft-deleteandEnabling Purge Protectionin one of the following articles:How to use soft-delete with PowerShell.How to use soft-delete with CLI.The existing key vault should have an RSA key of 2048 size or more. For more information about keys, seeAbout keys.Key vault must be in the same region as the storage account for your data.If you don't have an existing Azure Key Vault, you can also create it inline as described in the following section.

Enable keys
Configuring customer-managed key for your Import/Export service is optional. By default, the Import/Export service uses a Microsoft managed key to protect your BitLocker key. To enable customer-managed keys in the Azure portal, follow these steps:
Go to theOverviewblade for your Import job.
Go to theOverviewblade for your Import job.
In the right-pane, selectChoose how your BitLocker keys are encrypted.
In the right-pane, selectChoose how your BitLocker keys are encrypted.

In theEncryptionblade, you can view and copy the device BitLocker key. UnderEncryption type, you can choose how you want to protect your BitLocker key. By default, a Microsoft managed key is used.

You have the option to specify a customer managed key. After you have selected the customer managed key,Select key vault and a key.

If you created a new key vault, selectCreate newto create a key. RSA key size can be 2048 or greater.If the soft delete and purge protection are not enabled when you create the key vault, key vault will be updated to have soft delete and purge protection enabled.
If you created a new key vault, selectCreate newto create a key. RSA key size can be 2048 or greater.

If the soft delete and purge protection are not enabled when you create the key vault, key vault will be updated to have soft delete and purge protection enabled.
Provide the name for your key, accept the other defaults, and selectCreate.

In theEncryptionblade, you can see the key vault and the key selected for your customer managed key.
Important
You can only disable Microsoft managed keys and move to customer managed keys at any stage of the import/export job. However, you cannot disable the customer managed key once you have created it.
Troubleshoot customer managed key errors
If you receive any errors related to your customer managed key, use the following table to troubleshoot:
Key vault still has the MSI in the access policy.
Access policy has Get, Wrap, and Unwrap permissions enabled.
If key vault is in a VNet behind the firewall, check ifAllow Microsoft Trusted Servicesis enabled.
Check if the MSI of the job resource was reset toNoneusing APIs.If yes, then Set the value back toIdentity = SystemAssigned. This recreates the identity for the job resource.Once the new identity has been created, enableGet,Wrap, andUnwrappermissions to the new identity in the key vault's access policy
None
Identity = SystemAssigned
Get
Wrap
Unwrap
Yes, if the customer has the key backed-up and restores it.
No, otherwise.
Yes, if it is in the purge-protection duration, using the steps atRecover a key vault.
No, if it is beyond the purge-protection duration.
Revert the key vault back to the old tenant.
SetIdentity = Noneand then set the value back toIdentity = SystemAssigned. This deletes and recreates the identity once the new identity has been created. EnableGet,Wrap, andUnwrappermissions to the new identity in the key vault's Access policy.
Identity = None
Identity = SystemAssigned
