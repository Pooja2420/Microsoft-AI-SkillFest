Azure Front Door (classic) will be retired onMarch 31, 2027. To avoid any service disruption, it's important that youmigrate your Azure Front Door (classic) profilesto Azure Front Door Standard or Premium tier by March 2027. For more information, seeAzure Front Door (classic) retirement.
Note
Originandorigin groupin this article refers to the backend and backend pool of the Azure Front Door (classic) configuration.
This article describes concepts about how to map your web application deployment with Azure Front Door. You learn about what anoriginandorigin groupis in the Azure Front Door configuration.
Origin
An origin refers to the application deployment that Azure Front Door retrieves contents from. Azure Front Door supports origins hosted in Azure and applications hosted in your on-premises datacenter or with another cloud provider. An origin shouldn't be confused with your database tier or storage tier. The origin should be viewed as the endpoint for your application backend. When you add an origin to an origin group in the Front Door configuration, you must also configure the following settings:
Origin type:The type of resource you want to add. Front Door supports autodiscovery of your application backends from App Service, Cloud Service, or Storage. If you want a different resource in Azure or even a non-Azure backend, selectCustom host.ImportantDuring configuration, APIs doesn't validate if the origin is not accessible from the Front Door environment. Make sure that Front Door can reach your origin.

Certificate subject name validation:during Azure Front Door to origin TLS connection, Azure Front Door validates if the request host name matches the host name in the certificate provided by the origin. From a security standpoint, Microsoft doesn't recommend disabling certificate subject name check. For more information, seeEnd-to-end TLS encryption, especially if you want to disable this feature.

Priority. Assign priorities to your different backends when you want to use a primary service backend for all traffic. Also, provide backups if the primary or the backup backends are unavailable. For more information, seePriority.

Weight. Assign weights to your different backends to distribute traffic across a set of backends, either evenly or according to weight coefficients. For more information, seeWeights.

Important
When an origin isdisabled, both routing and health probes to the origin are also disabled.
Origin host header
Requests that get forwarded by Azure Front Door to an origin include a host header field that the origin uses to retrieve the targeted resource. The value for this field typically comes from the origin URI that has the host header and port.
For example, a request made forwww.contoso.comhas the host headerwww.contoso.com. If you use the Azure portal to configure your origin, the default value for this field is the host name of the origin. If your origin iscontoso-westus.azurewebsites.net, in the Azure portal, the autopopulated value for the origin host header iscontoso-westus.azurewebsites.net. However, if you use Azure Resource Manager templates or another method without explicitly setting this field, Front Door sends the incoming host name as the value for the host header. If the request was made forwww.contoso.com, and your origincontoso-westus.azurewebsites.nethas an empty header field, Front Door sets the host header aswww.contoso.com.
www.contoso.com
www.contoso.com
contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net
contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net
www.contoso.com
contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net
www.contoso.com
Most app backends (Azure Web Apps, Blob storage, and Cloud Services) require the host header to match the domain of the backend. However, the frontend host that routes to your origin uses a different hostname such aswww.contoso.net.
www.contoso.net
If your origin requires the host header to match the origin hostname, make sure that the origin host header includes the hostname of the origin.
Note
If you're using an App Service as an origin, make sure that the App Service also has the custom domain name configured. For more information, seeset up an existing custom domain name for your app.
To configure theâ¯origin host headerâ¯field for an origin in the origin group section:
Open your Front Door resource and select the origin group with the origin to configure.

Add an origin if you haven't done so, or edit an existing one.

Set the origin host header field to a custom value or leave it blank. The hostname for the incoming request gets used as the host header value.

Origin group
An origin group in Azure Front Door refers to a set of origins that receives similar traffic for their application. You can define the origin group as a logical grouping of your application instances across the world that receives the same traffic and responds with an expected behavior. These origins can be deployed across different regions or within the same region. All origins can be deployed in an Active/Active or Active/Passive configuration.
An origin group defines how origins get evaluated by health probes. It also defines the load balancing method between them.
Health probes
Azure Front Door sends periodic HTTP/HTTPS probe requests to each of your configured origins. Probe requests determine the proximity and health of each origin to load balance your end-user requests. Health probe settings for an origin group define how we poll the health status of app backends. The following settings are available for load-balancing configuration:
Path: The URL used for probe requests for all the origins in the origin group. For example, if one of your origins iscontoso-westus.azurewebsites.netand the path gets set to /probe/test.aspx, then Front Door sends health probe requests tohttp://contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net/probe/test.aspxif the protocol is set to HTTP.

For example, if one of your origins iscontoso-westus.azurewebsites.netand the path gets set to /probe/test.aspx, then Front Door sends health probe requests tohttp://contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net/probe/test.aspxif the protocol is set to HTTP.
contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net
http://contoso-westus.azurewebsites.net/probe/test.aspx
Protocol: Defines whether to send the health probe requests from Front Door to your origins with HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

Method: The HTTP method to be used for sending health probes. Options include GET or HEAD (default).NoteFor lower load and cost on your backends, Front Door recommends using HEAD requests for health probes.

Note
For lower load and cost on your backends, Front Door recommends using HEAD requests for health probes.
Interval (seconds): Defines the frequency of health probes to your origins, or the intervals in which each of the Front Door environments sends a probe.NoteFor faster failovers, set the interval to a lower value. The lower the value, the higher the health probe volume your backends receive. For example, if the interval is set to 30 seconds with say, 100 Front Door POPs globally, each backend will receive about 200 probe requests per minute.

For more information, seeHealth probes.
Load-balancing settings
Load-balancing settings for the origin group define how we evaluate health probes. These settings determine if the origin is healthy or unhealthy. They also check how to load-balance traffic between different origins in the origin group. The following settings are available for load-balancing configuration:
Sample size:Identifies how many samples of health probes we need to consider for origin health evaluation.
Sample size:Identifies how many samples of health probes we need to consider for origin health evaluation.
Successful sample size:Defines the sample size as previously mentioned, the number of successful samples needed to call the origin healthy. For example, assume a Front Door health probe interval is 30 seconds, sample size is 5, and successful sample size is 3. Each time we evaluate the health probes for your origin, we look at the last five samples over 150 seconds (5 x 30). At least three successful probes are required to declare the origin as healthy.

Latency sensitivity (extra latency):Defines if you want Front Door to send the request to the origin within the latency measurement sensitivity range or forward the request to the closest backend.
