Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy provides built-in initiative definitions to view a list of thecontrolsandcompliance domainsbased on responsibility (Customer,Microsoft,Shared).
For Microsoft-responsible controls, we provide additional details of our audit results based on
third-party attestation and our implementation details to achieve that compliance.
Microsoft-responsible controls are ofpolicyTypestatic.

Note
Regulatory Compliance is a Preview feature. For updated built-ins, the initiatives
controls map to the corresponding compliance standard. Existing compliance standard initiatives
are in the process of being updated to support Regulatory Compliance.
Regulatory Compliance defined
Regulatory Compliance is built on thegroupingportion of an initiative
definition. In built-ins, each grouping in the initiative definition defines a name (control), a
category (compliance domain), and provides a reference to thepolicyMetadataobject that has information
about thatcontrol. A Regulatory Compliance initiative definition must have thecategoryproperty set toRegulatory Compliance. As an otherwise standard initiative definition,
Regulatory Compliance initiatives supportparametersto create dynamic assignments.
category
Customers can create their own Regulatory Compliance initiatives. These definitions can be original
or copied from existing built-in definitions. If using a built-in Regulatory Compliance initiative
definition as a reference, it's recommended to monitor the source of the Regulatory Compliance
definitions in theAzure Policy GitHub repo.
To link a custom Regulatory Compliance initiative to your Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard, seeCreate custom security initiatives and policies.
Regulatory Compliance in portal
When an initiative definition has been created withgroups, theCompliancedetails
page in portal for that initiative has additional information.
A new tab,Controlsis added to the page. Filtering is available bycompliance domainand
policy definitions are grouped by thetitlefield from thepolicyMetadataobject. Each row
represents acontrolthat shows its compliance state, thecompliance domainit's part of,
responsibility information, and how many non-compliant and compliant policy definitions make up thatcontrol.

Selecting acontrolopens a page of details about that control. TheOverviewcontains the
information fromdescriptionandrequirements. Under thePoliciestab are all the individual
policy definitions in the initiative that contribute to thiscontrol. TheResource
compliancetab provides a granular view of each resource that's evaluated by a member policy of

From the samecontrolpage, changing to theResource compliancetab shows all resources thiscontrol's policy definitions include. Filters are available for name or ID, compliance state,
resource type, and location.

Regulatory Compliance in SDK
If Regulatory Compliance is enabled on an initiative definition, the evaluation scan record, events,
and policy states SDK each return additional properties. These additional properties are grouped by
compliance state and provide information on how many groups are in each state.
The following code is an example of added results from asummarizecall:
summarize
"policyGroupDetails": [{
        "complianceState": "noncompliant",
        "count": 4
    },
    {
        "complianceState": "compliant",
        "count": 76
    }
]
"policyGroupDetails": [{
        "complianceState": "noncompliant",
        "count": 4
    },
    {
        "complianceState": "compliant",
        "count": 76
    }
]
