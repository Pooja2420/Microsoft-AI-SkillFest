In this article, you learn how to add a new connection inAzure AI Foundry portal.
Connections are a way to authenticate and consume both Microsoft and other resources within your Azure AI Foundry projects. For example, connections can be used for prompt flow, training data, and deployments.Connections can be createdexclusively for one project or shared with all projects in the same Azure AI Foundry hub.
Connection types
Here's a table of some of the available connection types in Azure AI Foundry portal. ThePreviewcolumn indicates connection types that are currently in preview.
Create a new connection
Follow these steps to create a new connection that's only available for the current project.
Go to your project inAzure AI Foundry portal. If you don't have a project,create a new project.

Browse for and select your Azure AI Search service from the list of available services and then select the type ofAuthenticationto use for the resource. SelectAdd connection.TipDifferent connection types support different authentication methods. Using Microsoft Entra ID might require specific Azure role-based access permissions for your developers.

Network isolation
If your hub is configured fornetwork isolation, you might need to create an outbound private endpoint rule to connect toAzure Blob Storage,Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, orMicrosoft OneLake. A private endpoint rule is needed if one or both of the following are true:
The managed network for the hub is configured toallow only approved outbound traffic. In this configuration, you must explicitly create outbound rules to allow traffic to other Azure resources.
The data source is configured to disallow public access. In this configuration, the data source can only be reached through secure methods, such as a private endpoint.
To create an outbound private endpoint rule to the data source, use the following steps:
Sign in to theAzure portal, and select the Azure AI Foundry hub.
Sign in to theAzure portal, and select the Azure AI Foundry hub.
SelectNetworking, thenWorkspace managed outbound access.
SelectNetworking, thenWorkspace managed outbound access.
To add an outbound rule, selectAdd user-defined outbound rules. From theWorkspace outbound rulessidebar, provide the following information:Rule name: A name for the rule. The name must be unique for the Azure AI Foundry hub.Destination type: Private Endpoint.Subscription: The subscription that contains the Azure resource you want to connect to.Resource type:Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts. This resource provider is used for Azure Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Microsoft OneLake.Resource name: The name of the Azure resource (storage account).Sub Resource: The sub-resource of the Azure resource. Selectblobin the case of Azure Blob storage. Selectdfsfor Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Microsoft OneLake.
