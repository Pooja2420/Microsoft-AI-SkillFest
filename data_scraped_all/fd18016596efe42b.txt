Workload identity federation for the Azure service connection is nowgenerally available. We will work on supporting Workload identity federation for Azure-based Docker service connections next. This will help you eliminate secrets in the following use cases: (a) Run on a container job using a container from a private registry (b) Use a container from a private registry as a resource in the pipeline (c) Build and publish container images to a private Docker registry.
