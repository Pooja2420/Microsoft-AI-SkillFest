Log Analytics sample query
If you selected to send diagnostic data to a Log Analytics Workspace, then you can use SQL-like queries, such as the following example, to examine the data. For more information, seeLog Analytics Query Language.
The following example contains a query to obtain site-to-site route diagnostics.
AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"
AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"
Replace the following values, after the==, as needed based on the tables in this article.
==
GatewayDiagnosticLog
IKEDiagnosticLog
P2SDiagnosticLog
TunnelDiagnosticLog
RouteDiagnosticLog
In order to run the query, you have to open the Log Analytics resource you configured to receive the diagnostic logs, and then selectLogsunder theGeneraltab on the left side of the pane:
For Azure Firewall, aworkbookis provided to make log analysis easier. Using its graphical interface, you can investigate the diagnostic data without manually writing any Log Analytics query.
Azure Monitor Logs tables
This section lists the Azure Monitor Logs tables relevant to this service, which are available for query by Log Analytics using Kusto queries. The tables contain resource log data and possibly more depending on what is collected and routed to them.
