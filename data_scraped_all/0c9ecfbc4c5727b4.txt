Note
The following article is for Uniform Virtual Machine Scale Sets. We recommend using Flexible Virtual Machine Scale Sets for new workloads. Learn more about this new orchestration mode in ourFlexible Virtual Machine Scale Sets overview.
A Virtual Machine Scale Set allows you to deploy and manage a set of autoscaling virtual machines. You can scale the number of VMs in the scale set manually, or define rules to autoscale based on resource usage like CPU, memory demand, or network traffic. An Azure load balancer then distributes traffic to the VM instances in the scale set. In this quickstart, you create a Virtual Machine Scale Set in the Azure portal.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.

Create a load balancer
Azureload balancerdistributes incoming traffic among healthy virtual machine instances.
First, create a public Standard Load Balancer by using the portal. The name and public IP address you create are automatically configured as the load balancer's front end.

For more information, seeusername and password requirements.If you select a Linux OS disk image, you can instead chooseSSH public key. Only provide your public key, such as~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. You can use the Azure Cloud Shell from the portal tocreate and use SSH keys.

Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the resource group, scale set, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the scale set and then selectDelete.
Next steps
In this quickstart, you created a basic scale set in the Azure portal. To learn more, continue to the tutorial for how to create and manage Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
