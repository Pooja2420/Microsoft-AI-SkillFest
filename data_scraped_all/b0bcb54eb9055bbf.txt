View deployment history with Azure Resource Manager
Article

In this article
Azure Resource Manager enables you to view your deployment history. You can examine specific operations in past deployments and see which resources were deployed. This history contains information about any errors.
The deployment history for a resource group is limited to 800 deployments. As you near the limit, deployments are automatically deleted from the history. For more information, seeAutomatic deletions from deployment history.
For help with resolving particular deployment errors, seeTroubleshoot common Azure deployment errors.
Correlation ID and support
Each deployment has a correlation ID, which is used to track related events. If youcreate an Azure support request, support may ask you for the correlation ID. Support uses the correlation ID to identify the operations for the failed deployment.
The examples in this article show how to retrieve the correlation ID.
Resource group deployments
You can view details about a resource group deployment through the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API.

To list all deployments for a resource group, use theGet-AzResourceGroupDeploymentcommand.

Deployment operations and error message
Each deployment can include multiple operations. To see more details about a deployment, view the deployment operations. When a deployment fails, the deployment operations include an error message.
Portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
HTTP
On the summary for a deployment, selectOperation details.
On the summary for a deployment, selectOperation details.

You see the details for that step of the deployment. When an error occurs, the details include the error message.
You see the details for that step of the deployment. When an error occurs, the details include the error message.

To view the deployment operations for deployment to a resource group, use theGet-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperationcommand.
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -DeploymentName ExampleDeployment
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -DeploymentName ExampleDeployment
To view failed operations, filter operations withFailedstate.
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -Name ExampleDeployment | Where-Object { $_.ProvisioningState -eq "Failed" }
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -Name ExampleDeployment | Where-Object { $_.ProvisioningState -eq "Failed" }
To get the status message of failed operations, use the following command:
(Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -Name ExampleDeployment | Where-Object { $_.ProvisioningState -eq "Failed" }).StatusMessage
(Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -Name ExampleDeployment | Where-Object { $_.ProvisioningState -eq "Failed" }).StatusMessage
To view deployment operations for other scopes, use:
Get-AzDeploymentOperation
Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentOperation
Get-AzTenantDeploymentOperation
To view the deployment operations for deployment to a resource group, use theaz deployment operation group listcommand. You must have Azure CLI 2.6.0 or later.
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment
To view failed operations, filter operations withFailedstate.
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed']"
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed']"
To get the status message of failed operations, use the following command:
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed'].properties.statusMessage.error"
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed'].properties.statusMessage.error"
To view deployment operations for other scopes, use:
az deployment operation sub list
az deployment operation mg list
az deployment operation tenant list.
To get deployment operations, use the following operation. For the latest API version number to use in the request, seeDeployment Operations - List.
