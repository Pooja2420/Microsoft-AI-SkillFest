The first time you start Cloud Shell, you're prompted to select your storage options. If you want
store files that can be used every time you use Cloud Shell, you must create new or choose existing
storage resources. Cloud Shell uses a Microsoft Azure Files share to persist files across sessions.
To create new storage resources, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell using persistent storage.
To use existing storage resources, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell using existing storage.
How Cloud Shell storage works
Cloud Shell persists files through both of the following methods:
Creates a disk image to contain the contents of your$HOMEdirectory. The disk image is saved tohttps://storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename/.cloudconsole/acc_user.img.
Cloud Shell automatically syncs changes to this disk image.
$HOME
https://storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename/.cloudconsole/acc_user.img
Mounts the file share asclouddrivein your$HOMEdirectory./home/<User>/clouddrivepath is
mapped tostorageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename.
clouddrive
$HOME
/home/<User>/clouddrive
storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename
Note
All files in your$HOMEdirectory, such as SSH keys, are persisted in your user disk image,
which is stored in the mounted file share. Use best practices to secure the information in your$HOMEdirectory and mounted file share.

Securing storage access
For security, each user should create their own storage account. For Azure role-based access control
(RBAC), users must have contributor access or higher at the storage account level.
Cloud Shell uses an Azure file share in a storage account, inside a specified subscription. Due to
inherited permissions, users with sufficient access rights in the subscription can access the
storage accounts and file shares contained in the subscription.
Users should lock down access to their files by setting the permissions at the storage account or
the subscription level.
The Cloud Shell storage account contains files created by the Cloud Shell user in their home
directory, which might include sensitive information including access tokens or credentials.
Restrict resource creation with an Azure resource policy
Storage accounts that are created in Cloud Shell are tagged withms-resource-usage:azure-cloud-shell.
If you want to disallow users from creating storage accounts in Cloud Shell, create anAzure resource policythat's triggered by this specific tag.
ms-resource-usage:azure-cloud-shell
Managing Cloud Shell storage
Mount a new clouddrive
If you have previously selected to use ephemeral sessions for Cloud Shell, then you must reset your
preferences by selectingSettings>Reset User Settingsin Cloud Shell. Follow the steps to
mount anexisting storage accountor anew storage account.
Note
If you're mounting a new share, a new user image is created for your$HOMEdirectory. Your
previous$HOMEimage is kept in the previous file share.

Unmount clouddrive
You can unmount a Cloud Shell file share at any time. Since Cloud Shell requires a mounted file
share to be used, Cloud Shell prompts you to create and mount another file share on the next
session.
Runclouddrive unmount.
clouddrive unmount
Acknowledge and confirm prompts.
The unmounted file share continues to exist until you manually delete it. After unmounting, Cloud
Shell no longer searches for this file share in subsequent sessions. For more information, runclouddrive unmount -h,
clouddrive unmount -h
Command
  clouddrive unmount: Unmount an Azure file share from Cloud Shell.

    Unmount enables unmounting and disassociating a file share from Cloud Shell.
    All current sessions will be terminated. Machine state and non-persisted files will be lost.
    You will be prompted to create and mount a new file share on your next session.
    Your previously mounted file share will continue to exist.

    Note: This command does not unmount storage if the session is Ephemeral.

Arguments
  None

Warning
Although running this command doesn't delete any resources, manually deleting a resource group,
storage account, or file share that's mapped to Cloud Shell erases your$HOMEdirectory disk
image and any files in your file share. This action can't be undone.

Use PowerShell commands
Get information about the current file share
Use theGet-CloudDrivecommand in PowerShell to get information about the resources that back the
file share.
Get-CloudDrive
PS /home/user> Get-CloudDrive

FileShareName      : cs-user-microsoft-com-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
FileSharePath      : //cs7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.file.core.windows.net/cs-user-microsoft-com-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Unmount the file share
You can unmount a Cloud Shell file share at any time using theDismount-CloudDrivecmdlet.
Dismounting theclouddriveterminates the current session.
Dismount-CloudDrive
