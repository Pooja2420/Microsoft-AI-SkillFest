This tutorial helps you create and manage a virtual network gateway (VPN gateway) using the Azure portal. The VPN gateway is one part of the connection architecture that helps you securely access resources within a virtual network using VPN Gateway.

The left side of the diagram shows the virtual network and the VPN gateway that you create by using the steps in this article.
You can later add different types of connections, as shown on the right side of the diagram. For example, you can createsite-to-siteandpoint-to-siteconnections. To view different design architectures that you can build, seeVPN gateway design.
For more information about Azure VPN Gateway, seeWhat is Azure VPN Gateway? If you want to learn more about the configuration settings used in this tutorial, seeAbout VPN Gateway configuration settings.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network.
Create an active-active mode zone-redundant VPN gateway.
View the gateway public IP address.
Resize a VPN gateway (resize SKU).
Reset a VPN gateway.
Note
The steps in this article use the gateway SKUVpnGw2AZ, which is a SKU that supports Azure availability zones. Effective May 2025, all regions will accept anAZSKU, regardless of whether availability zones are supported in that region. For more information about gateway SKUs, seeAbout gateway SKUs.
Prerequisites
You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,create one for free.
Create a virtual network
This article uses the Azure portal to create a virtual network. You can also use a different tool or method to create a virtual network. For more information or steps, seeCreate a virtual network. For this exercise, the virtual network doesn't require the configuration of additional services, such asAzure BastionorDDoS Protection. However, you can add these services if you want to use them.
Sign in to the Azure portal.
InSearch resources, service, and docs (G+/)at the top of the portal page, entervirtual network. SelectVirtual networkfrom theMarketplacesearch results to open theVirtual networkpage.
On theVirtual networkpage, selectCreateto open theCreate virtual networkpage.
Fill out the required values for theBasicstab.
SelectNextorSecurityto go to theSecuritytab. For this exercise, leave the default values for all the services on this page.
SelectIP Addressesto go to theIP Addressestab. On theIP Addressestab, configure the required settings.
Review theIP addressespage and remove any address spaces or subnets that you don't need.
SelectReview + createto validate the virtual network settings.
After the settings are validated, selectCreateto create the virtual network.
Create a gateway subnet
Virtual network gateway resources are deployed to a specific subnet namedGatewaySubnet. The gateway subnet is part of the virtual network IP address range that you specify when you configure your virtual network.
If you don't have a subnet namedGatewaySubnet, when you create your VPN gateway, it fails. We recommend that you create a gateway subnet that uses a /27 (or larger). For example, /27 or /26. For more information, seeVPN Gateway settings - Gateway Subnet.
On the page for your virtual network, on the left pane, selectSubnetsto open theSubnetspage.
At the top of the page, select+ Subnetto open theAdd subnetpane.
ForSubnet purpose, selectVirtual Network Gatewayfrom the dropdown.
The name is automatically entered asGatewaySubnet. Adjust starting IP address and size if necessary. For example,10.1.255.0/27.
Don't adjust the other values on the page. ClickAddto add the subnet.
Important
NSGs on the gateway subnet aren't supported. Associating a network security group to this subnet might cause your virtual network gateway (VPN and ExpressRoute gateways) to stop functioning as expected. For more information about network security groups, seeWhat is a network security group?.
Create a VPN gateway
In this section, you create the virtual network gateway (VPN gateway) for your virtual network. Creating a gateway can often take 45 minutes or more, depending on the selected gateway SKU. Use the following steps to create a VPN gateway. Note that the VPN Gateway Basic SKU is only available inPowerShellor CLI.
InSearch resources, services, and docs (G+/), entervirtual network gateway. LocateVirtual network gatewayin theMarketplacesearch results and select it to open theCreate virtual network gatewaypage.
InSearch resources, services, and docs (G+/), entervirtual network gateway. LocateVirtual network gatewayin theMarketplacesearch results and select it to open theCreate virtual network gatewaypage.

On theBasicstab, fill in the values forProject detailsandInstance details.SettingValueNameExample: VNet1GWRegionThe region for the gateway must be the same as the virtual network.Gateway typeSelectVPN. VPN gateways use the virtual network gateway typeVPN.SKUExample: VpnGw2AZ. We recommend that you select aGateway SKUthat ends in AZ if your region supportsavailability zones.GenerationGeneration 2Virtual networkExample: VNet1. If your virtual network isn't available in the dropdown, you need to adjust the region you selected.SubnetExample: 10.1.255.0/27, A subnet namedGatewaySubnetis required to create a VPN gateway. If the gateway subnet doesn't autopopulate,andyou don't see the option to create one on this page, go back to your virtual network page and create the gateway subnet.
On theBasicstab, fill in the values forProject detailsandInstance details.
Specify the values forPublic IP address. These settings specify the public IP address object that gets associated to the VPN gateway. The public IP address is assigned to this object when the VPN gateway is created. The only time the primary public IP address changes is when the gateway is deleted and re-created.SettingValuePublic IP address nameExample: VNet1GWpip1Availability zoneThis setting is available for AZ SKUs in regions that supportavailability zones. Example:Zone-redundant.Enable active-active mode- SelectEnabledto take advantage of the benefits of anactive-active gateway. An active-active gateway requires an additional public IP address.- If you plan to use this gateway for site-to-site connections, verify theactive-active designthat you want to use.- Connections with your on-premises VPN device must be configured specifically to take advantage of active-active mode.- Some VPN devices don't support active-active mode. If you're not sure, check with your VPN device vendor. If you're using a VPN device that doesn't support active-active mode, you can selectDisabledfor this setting.Second public IP address nameOnly available for active-active mode gateways. Example: VNet1GWpip2Availability zoneExample:Zone-redundant.Configure BGPSelectDisabled, unless your configuration specifically requires this setting. If you do require this setting, the default ASN is 65515.Enable Key Vault AccessSelectDisabledunless you have a specific requirement to enable this setting.
Specify the values forPublic IP address. These settings specify the public IP address object that gets associated to the VPN gateway. The public IP address is assigned to this object when the VPN gateway is created. The only time the primary public IP address changes is when the gateway is deleted and re-created.
SelectReview + createto run validation.
SelectReview + createto run validation.
After validation passes, selectCreateto deploy the VPN gateway.
After validation passes, selectCreateto deploy the VPN gateway.
You can see the deployment status on theOverviewpage for your gateway. Once the gateway is created, you can view the IP address assigned to it by looking at the virtual network in the portal. The gateway appears as a connected device.
View public IP address
To view public IP addresses associated to your virtual network gateway, navigate to your gateway in the portal.
On theVirtual network gatewayportal page, underSettings, open thePropertiespage.
To view more information about the IP address object, click the associated IP address link.
Resize a gateway SKU
There are specific rules for resizing versus changing a gateway SKU. In this section, you resize the SKU. For more information, seeResize or change gateway SKUs.
Go to theConfigurationpage for your virtual network gateway.
On the right side of the page, select the dropdown arrow to show a list of available SKUs. Notice that the list only populates SKUs that you're able to use to resize your current SKU. If you don't see the SKU you want to use, instead of resizing, you have to change to a new SKU.
Select the SKU from the dropdown list and save your changes.
Reset a gateway
Gateway resets behave differently, depending on your gateway configuration. For more information, seeReset a VPN gateway or a connection.
In the portal, go to the virtual network gateway that you want to reset.
On theVirtual network gatewaypage, in the left pane, scroll and locateHelp -> Reset.
On theResetpage, selectReset. After the command is issued, the current active instance of Azure VPN gateway is rebooted immediately. Resetting the gateway causes a gap in VPN connectivity and might limit future root cause analysis of the issue.
Clean up resources
If you're not going to continue to use this application or go to the next tutorial, delete
these resources.
Enter the name of your resource group in theSearchbox at the top of the portal and select it from the search results.
SelectDelete resource group.
Enter your resource group forTYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAMEand selectDelete.
Next steps
After you create a VPN gateway, you can configure more gateway settings and connections. The following articles help you create a few of the most common configurations:
Site-to-site VPN connections
Point-to-site - Certificate authentication VPN connections
Point-to-site - Microsoft Entra ID authentication VPN connections
