This quickstart describes how to run an Azure Resource Graph query using the Azure CLI and the Resource Graph extension. The article also shows how to order (sort) and limit the query's results. You can run a query for resources in your tenant, management groups, or subscriptions. When you finish, you can remove the extension.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure account, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Azure CLImust be version 2.22.0 or higher for the Resource Graph extension.
A Bash shell environment where you can run Azure CLI commands. For example, Git Bash in aVisual Studio Codeterminal session.
Install the extension
To enable Azure CLI to query resources using Azure Resource Graph, the Resource Graph extension must be installed. The first time you run a query withaz grapha prompt is displayed to install the extension. Otherwise, use the following steps to do a manual installation.
az graph
List the available extensions and versions:az extension list-available --output table
List the available extensions and versions:
az extension list-available --output table
az extension list-available --output table
Install the extension:az extension add --name resource-graph
Install the extension:
az extension add --name resource-graph
az extension add --name resource-graph
Verify the extension was installed:az extension list --output table
Verify the extension was installed:
az extension list --output table
az extension list --output table
Display the extension's syntax:az graph query --helpFor more information about Azure CLI extensions, go toUse and manage extensions with the Azure CLI.
Display the extension's syntax:
az graph query --help
az graph query --help

Connect to Azure
From a Visual Studio Code terminal session, connect to Azure. If you have more than one subscription, run the commands to set context to your subscription. Replace<subscriptionID>with your Azure subscription ID.
<subscriptionID>
az login

# Run these commands if you have multiple subscriptions
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription <subscriptionID>
az login

# Run these commands if you have multiple subscriptions
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription <subscriptionID>
Run a query
After the Azure CLI extension is added to your environment, you can run a tenant-based query. The query in this example returns five Azure resources with thenameandtypeof each resource. To query bymanagement groupor subscription, use the--management-groupsor--subscriptionsarguments.
name
type
--management-groups
--subscriptions
Run an Azure Resource Graph query:az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5'This query example doesn't use a sort modifier likeorder by. If you run the query multiple times, it might yield a different set of resources for each request.
Run an Azure Resource Graph query:
az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5'
az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5'
This query example doesn't use a sort modifier likeorder by. If you run the query multiple times, it might yield a different set of resources for each request.
order by
Update the query toorder bythenameproperty:az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5 | order by name asc'Like the previous query, if you run this query multiple times it might yield a different set of resources for each request. The order of the query commands is important. In this example, theorder bycomes after thelimit. The query limits the results to five resources and then orders those results by name.
Update the query toorder bythenameproperty:
order by
name
az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5 | order by name asc'
az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5 | order by name asc'
Like the previous query, if you run this query multiple times it might yield a different set of resources for each request. The order of the query commands is important. In this example, theorder bycomes after thelimit. The query limits the results to five resources and then orders those results by name.
order by
limit
Update the query toorder bythenameproperty and thenlimitthe output to five results:az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | order by name asc | limit 5'If this query is run several times with no changes to your environment, the results are consistent and ordered by thenameproperty, but still limited to five results. The query orders the results by name and then limits the output to five resources.
Update the query toorder bythenameproperty and thenlimitthe output to five results:
order by
name
limit
az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | order by name asc | limit 5'
az graph query --graph-query 'Resources | project name, type | order by name asc | limit 5'
If this query is run several times with no changes to your environment, the results are consistent and ordered by thenameproperty, but still limited to five results. The query orders the results by name and then limits the output to five resources.
name
Clean up resources
To remove the Resource Graph extension, run the following command:
az extension remove --name resource-graph
az extension remove --name resource-graph
To sign out of your Azure CLI session:
az logout
az logout
