Azure DevOps provides one built-in role and three security groups to manage administrative tasks:
Team administrator role
Project Administrator group
Project Collection Administrator group
Team Foundation Administrators group
This article describes how to add users to the Team Foundation Administrators group. For information on adding users to other admin groups or roles, see:
Set permissions at the project- or collection-level.
Add a team administrator.
For an overview of administrative tasks, seeAbout user, team, project, and collection-level settings.
Prerequisite
You must be a member of the Team Foundation Administrators group to add a user to this group. The person who installed Azure DevOps Server is automatically added to this group.
Add a user to the server administrators group
To perform system maintenance, schedule backups, add functionality, and other server administrative tasks,
Azure DevOps Server administrators must be able to configure and control all aspects of Azure DevOps Server.
As a result, Azure DevOps Server administrators require administrative permissions
in the software that Azure DevOps Server inter-operates with, in addition to Azure DevOps Server itself.
You can quickly grant these permissions to administrators by adding them to theTeam Foundation Administratorsgroup in Azure DevOps Server.
On the application-tier server, add the user to the local Administrators group.
On the application-tier server, add the user to the local Administrators group.

On the application-tier server, open theAzure DevOps Server Administration Console.Choose theApplication Tier, and thenAdminister Security. Choose the[Team Foundation]\Team Foundation Administratorsgroup. Then, select the group type and then chooseAdd.TipTo add an Azure DevOps Server Group, first create it from the web portal.

If you're running a standard single-server deployment,
or a multi-server deployment without reporting, you're done!
However, if you have multiple application tiers,
you'll need to repeat these two steps on each application-tier server.
If you have reporting servers integrated with your Azure DevOps deployment,
you need to manually add administrative users to those products separately. For details, seeGrant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in Azure DevOps Server.
