When hosting a Linux virtual machine on Azure, the most common method for accessing that VM is through the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH). Any standard SSH client commonly found in Linux and Windows allows you to connect. You can also useAzure Cloud Shellfrom any browser.
This document describes how to connect, via SSH, to a VM that has a public IP. If you need to connect to a VM without a public IP, seeAzure Bastion Service.
Prerequisites
You need an SSH key pair. If you don't already have one, Azure creates a key pair during the deployment process. If you need help with creating one manually, seeCreate and use an SSH public-private key pair for Linux VMs in Azure.

You need an existing Network Security Group (NSG). Most VMs have an NSG by default, but if you don't already have one you can create one and attach it manually. For more information, seeCreate, change, or delete a network security group.

To connect to a Linux VM, you need the appropriate port open. Typically SSH uses port 22. The following instructions assume port 22 but the process is the same for other port numbers. You can validate an appropriate port is open for SSH using the troubleshooter or by checking manually in your VM settings. To check if port 22 is open:On the page for the VM, selectNetworkingfrom the left menu.On theNetworkingpage, check to see if there's a rule that allows TCP on port 22 from the IP address of the computer you're using to connect to the VM. If the rule exists, you can move to the next section.If there isn't a rule, add one by selectingAdd inbound port rule.ForService, selectSSHfrom the dropdown.EditPriorityandSourceif necessaryForName, typeSSH.When you're done, selectAdd.You should now have an SSH rule in the table of inbound port rules.

If you're having trouble connecting, you can also use portal:
Go to theAzure portalto connect to a VM. Search for and selectVirtual machines.
Select the virtual machine from the list.
SelectConnectfrom the left menu.
Select the option that fits with your preferred way of connecting. The portal helps walk you through the prerequisites for connecting.
Connect to the VM
Once the above prerequisites are met, you're ready to connect to your VM. Open your SSH client of choice. The SSH client command is typically included in Linux, macOS, and Windows. If you're using Windows 7 or older, where Win32 OpenSSH isn't included by default, consider installingWSLor usingAzure Cloud Shellfrom the browser.
Note
The following examples assume the SSH key is in the key.pem format. If you used CLI or Azure PowerShell to download your keys, they may be in the id_rsa or ED25519 format.
WSL, macOS, or native Linux client
Windows command line (cmd.exe, PowerShell etc.)
SSH with a new key pair
Ensure your public and private keys are in the correct directory. The directory is usually~/.ssh.If you generated keys manually or generated them with the CLI, then the keys are probably already there. However, if you downloaded them in pem format from the Azure portal, you may need to move them to the right location. Moving the keys is done with the following syntax:mv PRIVATE_KEY_SOURCE  PRIVATE_KEY_DESTINATIONFor example, if the key is in theDownloadsfolder, andmyKey.pemis the name of your SSH key, type:mv /Downloads/myKey.pem ~/.sshNoteIf you're using WSL, local files are found in themnt/c/directory. Accordingly, the path to the downloads folder and SSH key would be/mnt/c/Users/{USERNAME}/Downloads/myKey.pem

~/.ssh
If you generated keys manually or generated them with the CLI, then the keys are probably already there. However, if you downloaded them in pem format from the Azure portal, you may need to move them to the right location. Moving the keys is done with the following syntax:mv PRIVATE_KEY_SOURCE  PRIVATE_KEY_DESTINATION
mv PRIVATE_KEY_SOURCE  PRIVATE_KEY_DESTINATION
For example, if the key is in theDownloadsfolder, andmyKey.pemis the name of your SSH key, type:
Downloads
myKey.pem
mv /Downloads/myKey.pem ~/.ssh
mv /Downloads/myKey.pem ~/.ssh
Note
If you're using WSL, local files are found in themnt/c/directory. Accordingly, the path to the downloads folder and SSH key would be/mnt/c/Users/{USERNAME}/Downloads/myKey.pem
mnt/c/
/mnt/c/Users/{USERNAME}/Downloads/myKey.pem
Ensure you have read-only access to the private key by runningchmod 400 ~/.ssh/myKey.pem
Ensure you have read-only access to the private key by running
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/myKey.pem
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/myKey.pem
Run the SSH command with the following syntax:ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY USERNAME@EXTERNAL_IPFor example, if yourazureuseris the username you created and20.51.230.13is the public IP address of your VM, type:ssh -i ~/.ssh/myKey.pem azureuser@20.51.230.13
Run the SSH command with the following syntax:ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY USERNAME@EXTERNAL_IP
ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY USERNAME@EXTERNAL_IP
For example, if yourazureuseris the username you created and20.51.230.13is the public IP address of your VM, type:
azureuser
20.51.230.13
ssh -i ~/.ssh/myKey.pem azureuser@20.51.230.13
ssh -i ~/.ssh/myKey.pem azureuser@20.51.230.13
Validate the returned fingerprint.If you have never connected to this VM before, you're asked to verify the hosts fingerprint. It's tempting to accept the fingerprint presented, but that exposes you to a potential person in the middle attack. You should always validate the hosts fingerprint. You only need to do this the first time you connect from a client. To get the host fingerprint via the portal, use the Run Command feature to execute the command:ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | awk '{print $2}'

SSH With existing public key

Run the following command in your SSH client. In this example,20.51.230.13is the public IP Address of your VM andazureuseris the username you created when you created the VM.
ssh azureuser@20.51.230.13
ssh azureuser@20.51.230.13
Validate the returned fingerprint.If you have never connected to the desired VM from your current SSH client before you're asked to verify the host's fingerprint. While the default option is to accept the fingerprint presented, you're exposed to a possible "person in the middle attack". You should always validate the host's fingerprint, which only needs to be done the first time your client connects. To obtain the host fingerprint via the portal, use the Run Command feature to execute the command:ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | awk '{print $2}'
