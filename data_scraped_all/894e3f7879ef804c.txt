In Microsoft Entra ID, if another administrator or non-administrator needs to manage Microsoft Entra resources, you assign them a Microsoft Entra role that provides the permissions they need. For example, you can assign roles to allow adding or changing users, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, or managing domain names.
This article lists the Microsoft Entra built-in roles you can assign to allow management of Microsoft Entra resources. For information about how to assign roles, seeAssign Microsoft Entra roles. If you are looking for roles to manage Azure resources, seeAzure built-in roles.
All roles
AI Administrator
Assign the AI Administrator role to users who need to do the following tasks:
Manage all aspects of Microsoft 365 Copilot
Manage AI-related enterprise services, extensibility, and copilot agents from the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center
Approve and publish line-of-business copilot agents
Allow users to install an app or install an app for users in the organization if the app does not require permission
Read and configure Azure and Microsoft 365 service health dashboards
View usage reports, adoption insights, and organizational insight
Create and manage support tickets in Azure and the Microsoft 365 admin center
Application Administrator

This is aprivileged role. Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. Note that users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.
This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph.
Important
This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions forotherapps (for example, other Microsoft apps, 3rd-party apps, or apps that you have registered). You can stillrequestthese permissions as part of the app registration, butgranting(that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Privileged Role Administrator.
This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the applicationâs identity. If the applicationâs identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the applicationâs identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an applicationâs identity.
Application Developer

This is aprivileged role. Users in this role can create application registrations when the "Users can register applications" setting is set to No. This role also grants permission to consent on one's own behalf when the "Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf" setting is set to No. Users assigned to this role are added as owners when creating new application registrations.

This is aprivileged role. Users in this role have the same permissions as the Application Administrator role, excluding the ability to manage application proxy. This role grants the ability to create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications and application registrations. Users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.
This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph.
Important
This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions forotherapps (for example, other Microsoft apps, 3rd-party apps, or apps that you have registered). You can stillrequestthese permissions as part of the app registration, butgranting(that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Privileged Role Administrator.
This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the applicationâs identity. If the applicationâs identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the applicationâs identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an applicationâs identity.
Cloud Device Administrator

Domain Name Administrator

This is aprivileged role. Users with this role can manage (read, add, verify, update, and delete) domain names. They can also read directory information about users, groups, and applications, as these objects possess domain dependencies. For on-premises environments, users with this role can configure domain names for federation so that associated users are always authenticated on-premises. These users can then sign into Microsoft Entra based services with their on-premises passwords via single sign-on. Federation settings need to be synced via Microsoft Entra Connect, so users also have permissions to manage Microsoft Entra Connect.
Dynamics 365 Administrator
Users with this role have global permissions within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online, when the service is present, as well as the ability to manage support tickets and monitor service health. For more information, seeUse service admin roles to manage your tenant.

On the other hand, this role does not include the ability to review user data or make changes to the attributes that are included in the organization schema. Changes to Identity Experience Framework policies (also known as custom policies) are also outside the scope of this role.
External ID User Flow Attribute Administrator
Users with this role add or delete custom attributes available to all user flows in the Microsoft Entra organization. As such, users with this role can change or add new elements to the end-user schema and impact the behavior of all user flows and indirectly result in changes to what data may be asked of end users and ultimately sent as claims to applications. This role cannot edit user flows.
External Identity Provider Administrator

This is aprivileged role. This administrator manages federation between Microsoft Entra organizations and external identity providers. With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (e.g. authentication path, service ID, assigned key containers). This user can enable the Microsoft Entra organization to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end-user experiences depends on the type of organization:
Microsoft Entra organizations for employees and partners: The addition of a federation (e.g. with Gmail) will immediately impact all guest invitations not yet redeemed. SeeAdding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users.
Azure Active Directory B2C organizations: The addition of a federation (for example, with Facebook, or with another Microsoft Entra organization) does not immediately impact end-user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (also called a built-in policy). SeeConfiguring a Microsoft account as an identity providerfor an example. To change user flows, the limited role of "B2C User Flow Administrator" is required.
Fabric Administrator
Users with this role have global permissions within Microsoft Fabric and Power BI, when the service is present, as well as the ability to manage support tickets and monitor service health. For more information, seeUnderstanding Fabric admin roles.

Global Administrators can view Directory Activity logs. Furthermore, Global Administrators canelevate their accessto manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups. This allows Global Administrators to get full access to all Azure resources using the respective Microsoft Entra tenant. The person who signs up for the Microsoft Entra organization becomes a Global Administrator. There can be more than one Global Administrator at your company. Global Administrators can reset the password for any user and all other administrators. A Global Administrator cannot remove their own Global Administrator assignment. This is to prevent a situation where an organization has zero Global Administrators.
Note
As a best practice, Microsoft recommends that you assign the Global Administrator role to fewer than five people in your organization. For more information, seeBest practices for Microsoft Entra roles.
Global Reader

This is aprivileged role. Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services but can't take management actions. Global Reader is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Assign Global Reader instead of Global Administrator for planning, audits, or investigations.

Helpdesk Administrator

This is aprivileged role. Users with this role can change passwords, invalidate refresh tokens, create and manage support requests with Microsoft for Azure and Microsoft 365 services, and monitor service health. Invalidating a refresh token forces the user to sign in again. Whether a Helpdesk Administrator can reset a user's password and invalidate refresh tokens depends on the role the user is assigned. For a list of the roles that a Helpdesk Administrator can reset passwords for and invalidate refresh tokens, seeWho can reset passwords.
Users with this rolecannotdo the following:
Cannot change the credentials or reset MFA for members and owners of arole-assignable group.
Important
Users with this role can change passwords for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Microsoft Entra ID. Changing the password of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere not granted to Helpdesk Administrators. Through this path a Helpdesk Administrator may be able to assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
Azure subscription owners, who might have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere.
