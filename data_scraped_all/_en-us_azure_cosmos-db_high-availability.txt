This article describes high availability (reliability) support in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and covers bothavailability zones, as well ascross-region disaster recovery and business continuity.
Availability zone support
Availability zones are physically separate groups of datacenters within each Azure region. When one zone fails, services can fail over to one of the remaining zones.
For more information on availability zones in Azure, seeWhat are availability zones?
Azure Cosmos DB is a multitenant service that manages all details of individual compute nodes transparently. You don't have to worry about any kind of patching or planned maintenance. Azure Cosmos DB guaranteesSLAs for availabilityand P99 latency through all automatic maintenance operations that the system performs.
Azure Cosmos DB offers:
Individual node outage resiliency.Azure Cosmos DB automatically mitigatesreplicaoutages by guaranteeing at least three replicas of your data in each Azure region for your account within a four-replica quorum. This guarantee results in an RTO of 0 and an RPO of 0 for individual node outages, without requiring application changes or configurations. When you enable zone redundancy, those replicas are distributed across multiple availability zones, providing resiliency to datacenter problems and outages.
Zone outage resiliency.When you deploy an Azure Cosmos DB account by usingavailability zones, Azure Cosmos DB provides an RTO of 0 and an RPO of 0, even in a zone outage. For information on RTO, seeWhat are business continuity, high availability, and disaster recovery?.
With availability zones enabled, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL supports azone-redundantconfiguration.
Prerequisites
Your replicas must be deployed in an Azure region that supports availability zones. To see if your region supports availability zones, see thelist of supported regions.

Impact of using availability zones
The impact of availability zones on the high availability of your Cosmos DB for NoSQL database depends on the consistency level of the account and which regions have availability zones enabled. In many cases, availability zones donât add value or add minimal value if the account is multi-region (unless configured with strong consistency).
Consult the table below to estimate the impact of using availability zones in your current account configuration:
SLA improvements
Because availability zones are physically separate and provide distinct power source, network, and cooling, Availability SLAs (Service-level agreements) are higher (99.995%) than accounts with a single region (99.99%). Regions where availability zones are enabled are charged at 25% premium, while those without availability zones don't incur the premium. Moreover, the premium pricing for availability zones is waived for accounts configured with multi-region writes and/or for collections configured with autoscale mode.
Adding an additional region to Cosmos DB account typically increases existing bill by 100% (additively not multiplicatively) though small variations in cost across regions exist. For more details, seepricing page.
Enabling AZs, adding additional region(s), or turning on multi-region writes can be thought as a layering approach that increases resiliency and availability of a given Cosmos DB account at each step of the way - from 4 9's availability for single region no-AZ configuration, through 4 and half 9's for single region with AZs, all the way to 5 9's of availability for multi-region configuration with the multi-region write option enabled. Please refer to the following table for a summary of SLAs for each configuration.
1For serverless accounts, RUs are multiplied by a factor of 1.25.
2The 1.25 rate applies only to regions in which you enable availability zones.
Create a resource with availability zones enabled
You can configure availability zones only when you add a new region to an Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL account.
To enable availability zone support you can use:

Cross-region disaster recovery and business continuity
Disaster recovery (DR) refers to practices that organizations use to recover from high-impact events, such as natural disasters or failed deployments that result in downtime and data loss. Regardless of the cause, the best remedy for a disaster is a well-defined and tested DR plan and an application design that actively supports DR. Before you start creating your disaster recovery plan, seeRecommendations for designing a disaster recovery strategy.
For DR, Microsoft uses theshared responsibility model. In this model, Microsoft ensures that the baseline infrastructure and platform services are available. However, many Azure services don't automatically replicate data or fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. For those services, you're responsible for setting up a disaster recovery plan that works for your workload. Most services that run on Azure platform as a service (PaaS) offerings provide features and guidance to support DR. You can useservice-specific features to support fast recoveryto help develop your DR plan.
Region outages are outages that affect all Azure Cosmos DB nodes in an Azure region, across all availability zones. For the rare cases of region outages, you can configure Azure Cosmos DB to support various outcomes of durability and availability.
Durability
When an Azure Cosmos DB account is deployed in a single region, generally no data loss occurs. Data access is restored after Azure Cosmos DB services recover in the affected region. Data loss might occur only with an unrecoverable disaster in the Azure Cosmos DB region.
To help you protect against complete data loss that might result from catastrophic disasters in a region, Azure Cosmos DB provides two backup modes:
Continuous backupsback up each region every 100 seconds. They enable you to restore your data to any point in time with 1-second granularity. In each region, the backup is dependent on the data committed in that region. If the region has availability zones enabled, then the backup is stored in zone-redundant storage accounts.
Periodic backupsfully back up all partitions from all containers under your account, with no synchronization across partitions. The minimum backup interval is 1 hour.
When an Azure Cosmos DB account is deployed in multiple regions, data durability depends on the consistency level that you configure on the account. The following table details, for all consistency levels, the RPO of an Azure Cosmos DB account that's deployed in at least two regions.
K= The number of versions (that is, updates) of an item.
T= The time interval since the last update.
For multiple-region accounts, the minimum value ofKandTis 100,000 write operations or 300 seconds. This value defines the minimum RPO for data when you're using bounded staleness.
For more information on the differences between consistency levels, seeConsistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB.
Service managed failover
If your solution requires continuous uptime during region outages, you can configure Azure Cosmos DB to replicate your data across multiple regions and to transparently fail over to operating regions when required.
Single-region accounts might lose accessibility after a regional outage. To ensure business continuity at all times, we recommend that you set up your Azure Cosmos DB account witha single write region and at least a second (read) regionand enableservice-managed failover.
Service-managed failover allows Azure Cosmos DB to fail over the write region of a multiple-region account in order to preserve business continuity at the cost of data loss, as described earlier in theDurabilitysection. Regional failovers are detected and handled in the Azure Cosmos DB client. They don't require any changes from the application. For instructions on how to enable multiple read regions and service-managed failover, seeManage an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure portal.
Important
If you have chosen single-region write configuration with multiple read regions, we strongly recommend that you configure the Azure Cosmos DB accounts used for production workloads toenable service-managed failover. This configuration enables Azure Cosmos DB to fail over the account databases to available regions.
In the absence of this configuration, the account will experience loss of write availability for the whole duration of the write region outage. Manual failover won't succeed because of a lack of region connectivity.
Warning
Even with service-managed failover enabled, partial outage may require manual intervention for the Azure Cosmos DB service team. In these scenarios, it may take up to 1 hour (or more) for failover to take effect. For better write availability during partial outages, we recommend enabling availability zones in addition to service-managed failover.
Multiple write regions
You can configure Azure Cosmos DB to accept writes in multiple regions. This configuration is useful for reducing write latency  in geographically distributed applications.
When you configure an Azure Cosmos DB account for multiple write regions, strong consistency isn't supported and write conflicts might arise. For more information on how to resolve these conflicts, seeConflict types and resolution policies when using multiple write regions.
Important
Updating same Document ID frequently (or recreating same document ID frequently after TTL or delete) will have an effect on replication performance due to increased number of conflicts generated in the system.
When an Azure Cosmos DB account is configured with multiple-region writes, one of the regions will act as an arbiter in write conflicts.
Here are some best practices to consider when you're writing to multiple regions.
When you use multiple-region writes, the application should issue read and write traffic that originates in the local region strictly to the local Cosmos DB region. For optimal performance, avoid cross-region calls.
It's important for the application to minimize conflicts by avoiding the following antipatterns:
Sending the same write operation to all regions to increase the odds of getting a fast response time
Sending the same write operation to all regions to increase the odds of getting a fast response time
Randomly determining the target region for a read or write operation on a per-request basis

Using a round-robin policy to determine the target region for a read or write operation on a per-request basis.
You can't configure multiple-region write accounts for strong consistency. The region that's being written to responds immediately after Azure Cosmos DB replicates the data locally while asynchronously replicating the data globally.
Though it's infrequent, a replication lag might occur on one or a few partitions when you're geo-replicating data. Replication lag can occur because of a rare blip in network traffic or higher-than-usual rates of conflict resolution.
For instance, an architecture in which the application writes to Region A but reads from Region B introduces a dependency on replication lag between the two regions. However, if the application reads and writes to the same region, performance remains constant even in the presence of replication lag.
In session consistency, you use the session token for both read and write operations.
For read operations, Azure Cosmos DB sends the cached session token to the server with a guarantee of receiving data that corresponds to the specified (or a more recent) session token.
For write operations, Azure Cosmos DB sends the session token to the database with a guarantee of persisting the data only if the server has caught up to the provided session token. In single-region write accounts, the write region is always guaranteed to have caught up to the session token. However, in multiple-region write accounts, the region that you write to might not have caught up to writes issued to another region. If the client writes to Region A with a session token from Region B, Region A won't be able to persist the data until it catches up to changes made in Region B.
It's best to use session tokens only for read operations and not for write operations when you're passing session tokens between client instances.
The server's updates to resolve or confirm the absence of conflicts can collide with writes triggered by the application when the same document is repeatedly updated. Repeated updates in rapid succession to the same document experience higher latencies during conflict resolution.
Although occasional bursts in repeated updates to the same document are inevitable, you might consider exploring an architecture where new documents are created instead if steady-state traffic sees rapid updates to the same document over an extended period.
Read and write outages
Clients of single-region accounts will experience loss of read and write availability until service is restored.
Multiple-region accounts experience different behaviors depending on the following configurations and outage types.
The affected region is disconnected and marked offline. TheAzure Cosmos DB SDKsredirect read calls to the next available region in the preferred region list.

No changes are required in your application code to handle read region outages. When the affected read region is back online, it syncs with the current write region and is available again to serve read requests after it has fully caught up.

Subsequent reads are redirected to the recovered region without requiring any changes to your application code. During both failover and rejoining of a previously failed region, Azure Cosmos DB continues to honor read consistency guarantees.

Even in a rare and unfortunate event where an Azure write region is permanently irrecoverable, there's no data loss if your multiple-region Azure Cosmos DB account is configured with strong consistency. A multiple-region Azure Cosmos DB account has the durability characteristics specified earlier in theDurabilitysection.

During a write region outage, the Azure Cosmos DB account promotes a secondary region to be the new primary write region whenservice-managed failoveris configured on the Azure Cosmos DB account. The failover occurs to another region in the order of region priority that you specify.

Manual failover shouldn't be triggered and won't succeed in the presence of an outage of the source or destination region. The reason is that the failover procedure includes a consistency check that requires connectivity between the regions.

When the previously affected region is back online, any write data that wasn't replicated when the region failed is made available through theconflict feed. Applications can read the conflict feed, resolve the conflicts based on the application-specific logic, and write the updated data back to the Azure Cosmos DB container as appropriate.

After the previously affected write region recovers, it will show as "online" in Azure portal, and become available as a read region. At this point, it is safe to switch back to the recovered region as the write region by using [PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or the Azure portal](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-manage-database-account#perform-manual-failover-on-an-azure-cosmos-db-account. There isno data or availability lossbefore, while, or after you switch the write region. Your application continues to be highly available.

Warning
In the event of a write region outage, where the Azure Cosmos DB account promotes a secondary region to be the new primary write region viaservice-managed failover, the original write region willnot be be promoted back as the write region automaticallyonce it is recovered. It is your responsibility to switch back to the recovered region as the write region usingPowerShell, the Azure CLI, or the Azure portal(once safe to do so, as described above).
For single-region accounts, clients experience a loss of read and write availability during an Azure Cosmos DB region outage. Multiple-region accounts experience different behaviors, as described in the following table.
Even if your Azure Cosmos DB account is highly available, your application might not be correctly designed to remain highly available. To test the end-to-end high availability of your application as a part of your application testing or disaster recovery (DR) drills, temporarily disable service-managed failover for the account. Invokemanual failover by using PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or the Azure portal, and then monitor your application. After you complete the test, you can fail back over to the primary region and restore service-managed failover for the account.
Important
Don't invoke manual failover during an Azure Cosmos DB outage on either the source or destination region. Manual failover requires region connectivity to maintain data consistency, so it won't succeed.
