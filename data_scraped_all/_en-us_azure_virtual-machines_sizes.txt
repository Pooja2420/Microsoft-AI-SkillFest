Azure Virtual Machine (VM) sizes are designed to provide a wide range of options for hosting your servers and their workloads in the cloud. Sizes are categorized into different families and types, each optimized for specific purposes. Users can choose the most suitable VM size based on their requirements, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth.
This article describes what sizes are, gives an overview of the available sizes and shows different options for Azure virtual machine instances you can use to run your apps and workloads.

VM size and series naming
Azure VM sizes follow specific naming conventions to denote varying features and specifications. Each character in the name represents different aspects of the VM. These include the VM family, number of vCPUs, and extra features like premium storage or included accelerators.
VM naming is further broken down into the 'Series' name and the 'Size' name. Size names include extra characters representing the number of vCPUs, type of storage, etc.
Name structure breakdown
Series
Size
Here's a breakdown of a 'General purpose,DCads_v5-series' size series.
1Most families are represented using one letter, but others such as GPU sizes (ND-series,NV-series, etc.) use two.2Most subfamilies are represented with a single upper case letter, but others (such asEbsv5-series) are still considered subfamilies of their parent family due to feature differences.3If no feature letter for a CPU is listed, the series uses Intel x86-64 CPUs. If the CPU is AMD, it's listed asa. If the CPU is ARM based (Microsoft Cobalt or Ampere Altra), it's listed asp.4There can be any number of extra features in a size name. There could be none (Dv5-series) or there could be three (Dplds_v6-series).5Version numbers only appear in the size name if there are multiple versions of the same series. If you're using the first version of a series (HB-series,B-series, etc.) it's often not included in the size name.

General purpose
General purpose VM sizes provide balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers.
Family list
A family

DC family
The 'A' family of VM size series are one of Azure's general purpose VM instances. They're designed for entry-level workloads, such as development and test environments, small to medium databases, and low-traffic web servers.
View the full A family page
Cost Efficiency:A-series VMs are some of the most budget-friendly options available on Azure, making them a good choice for projects with limited financial resources or those that do not require high-performance compute capabilities.
General Workloads:A-series VMs are well-suited for handling basic applications, light web servers, and small databases that do not demand extensive CPU, memory, or I/O performance.
Entry-Level Applications:A-series VMs can serve as a good starting point for deploying applications that are not expected to scale significantly. They provide a platform for applications and services that require less processing power.
The 'B' family of VM size series are one of Azure's general purpose VM instances. While traditional Azure virtual machines provide fixed CPU performance, B-series virtual machines are the only VM type that use credits for CPU performance provisioning. B-series VMs utilize a CPU credit model to track how much CPU is consumed - the virtual machine accumulates CPU credits when a workload is operating below the base CPU performance threshold and, uses credits when running above the base CPU performance threshold until all of its credits are consumed. Upon consuming all the CPU credits, a B-series virtual machine is throttled back to its base CPU performance until it accumulates the credits to CPU burst again.
