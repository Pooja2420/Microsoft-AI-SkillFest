Security policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud include security standards and recommendations that improve your cloud security posture.
Security standards define rules, compliance conditions, and actions (effects) if conditions aren't met. Defender for Cloud assesses resources and workloads against the security standards in your Azure subscriptions, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects. Based on these assessments, security recommendations provide practical steps to remediate security issues.
Security standards
Security standards in Defender for Cloud originate from these sources:
Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB): The MCSB standard applies by default when you onboard cloud accounts to Defender. Yoursecure scoreis based on assessment against some MCSB recommendations.

Regulatory compliance standards: When you enable one or moreDefender for Cloud plans, you can add standards from various predefined regulatory compliance programs.

Custom standards: You can create custom security standards in Defender for Cloud and add built-in and custom recommendations as needed.

Security standards in Defender for Cloud are based onAzure Policyinitiativesor the Defender for Cloud native platform. Currently, Azure standards are based on Azure Policy, while AWS and GCP standards are based on Defender for Cloud.
Work with security standards
You can perform the following actions with security standards in Defender for Cloud:
Modify the built-in MCSB for the subscription: When you enable Defender for Cloud, the MCSB automatically assigns to all Defender for Cloud registered subscriptions.Learn more about managing the MCSB standard.

Add regulatory compliance standards: If you have one or more paid plans enabled, you can assign built-in compliance standards to assess your Azure, AWS, and GCP resources.Learn more about assigning regulatory standards.

Add custom standards: If you have at least one paid Defender plan enabled, you can define newcustom standardsandcustom recommendationsin the Defender for Cloud portal. You can then add recommendations to those standards.

Custom standards
Custom standards appear alongside built-in standards in theRegulatory Compliancedashboard.
Recommendations from assessments against custom standards appear with recommendations from built-in standards. Custom standards can include built-in and custom recommendations.
Custom recommendations
Using custom recommendations based on Kusto Query Language (KQL) is recommended and supported for all clouds but requires enabling theDefender CSPM plan. With these recommendations, you specify a unique name, description, remediation steps, severity, and relevant standards. You add recommendation logic with KQL. A query editor provides a built-in query template that you can tweak, or you can write your KQL query.
Alternatively, all Azure customers can onboard their Azure Policy custom initiatives as custom recommendations (legacy approach).

Security recommendations
Defender for Cloud continuously analyzes and assesses the security state of protected resources against defined security standards to identify potential security misconfigurations and weaknesses. Defender for Cloud provides recommendations based on assessment findings.
Each recommendation includes the following information:
A short description of the issue
Remediation steps for implementing the recommendation
Affected resources
Risk level
Risk factors
Attack paths
Every recommendation in Defender for Cloud has an associated risk level representing how exploitable and impactful the security issue is in your environment. The risk assessment engine considers factors such as internet exposure, data sensitivity, lateral movement possibilities, and attack path remediation. You can prioritize recommendations based on risk levels.
Important
Risk prioritizationdoesn't affect the secure score.
Example
The MCSB standard is an Azure Policy initiative that includes multiple compliance controls. One of these controls is "Storage accounts should restrict network access using virtual network rules."
Defender for Cloud continuously assesses resources. If it finds any that donât satisfy this control, it marks them as noncompliant and triggers a recommendation. In this case, the guidance is to harden Azure Storage accounts that aren't protected with virtual network rules.
