For securing a SQL Server database, you can take precautions like designing a secure system, encrypting confidential assets, and building a firewall. However, physical theft of media like drives or tapes can still compromise the data.
TDE provides a solution to this problem, with real-time I/O encryption/decryption of data at rest (data and log files) by using a symmetric database encryption key (DEK) secured by a certificate. For more information about migrating TDE certificates manually, seeMove a TDE Protected Database to Another SQL Server.
When you migrate a TDE-protected database, the certificate (asymmetric key) used to open the database encryption key (DEK) must also be moved along with the source database. Therefore, you need to recreate the server certificate in themasterdatabase of the target SQL Server for that instance to access the database files.
master
You can use theAzure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studioto help you migrate TDE-enabled databases (preview) from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to Azure SQL.
The TDE-enabled database migration process automates manual tasks such as backing up the database certificate keys (DEK), copying the certificate files from the on-premises SQL Server to the Azure SQL target, and then reconfiguring TDE for the target database again.
Important
Currently, only Azure SQL Managed Instance targets are supported. Encrypted Backups aren't supported.
In this tutorial, you learn how to migrate the exampleAdventureWorksTDEencrypted database from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to an Azure SQL managed instance.

Have an Azure account that is assigned to one of the following built-in roles:Contributor for the target managed instance (and Storage Account to upload your backups of the TDE certificate files from SMB network share).Reader role for the Azure Resource Groups containing the target managed instance or the Azure storage account.Owner or Contributor role for the Azure subscription (required if creating a new DMS service).As an alternative to using the above built-in roles, you can assign a custom role.

Post-migration steps
Your target managed instance should now have the databases, and their respective certificates migrated. To verify the current status of the recently migrated database, copy and paste the following example into a new query window on Azure Data Studio while connected to your managed instance target. Then, selectRun.
USE master;
GO

SELECT db_name(database_id),
       key_algorithm,
       encryption_state_desc,
       encryption_scan_state_desc,
       percent_complete
FROM sys.dm_database_encryption_keys
WHERE database_id = DB_ID('Your database name');
GO
USE master;
GO

SELECT db_name(database_id),
       key_algorithm,
       encryption_state_desc,
       encryption_scan_state_desc,
       percent_complete
FROM sys.dm_database_encryption_keys
WHERE database_id = DB_ID('Your database name');
GO
The query returns the information about the database, the encryption status and the pending percent complete. In this case, it's zero because the TDE certificate has been already completed.
