One of the main features of Microsoft Defender for Cloud is cloud security posture management (CSPM). CSPM provides detailed visibility into the security state of your assets and workloads and offers hardening guidance to help you improve your security posture.
Defender for Cloud continually assesses your resources against security standards defined for your Azure subscriptions, Amazon Web Service (AWS) accounts, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects. Defender for Cloud issues security recommendations based on these assessments.
By default, when you enable Defender for Cloud on an Azure subscription, theMicrosoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)compliance standard is enabled and provides recommendations to secure your multicloud environments. Defender for Cloud provides an aggregatedsecure scorebased on some of the MCSB recommendations. A higher score indicates a lower identified risk level.
CSPM plans
Defender for Cloud offers two CSPM plan options:
Foundational CSPM- A free plan enabled by default for subscriptions and accounts that onboard to Defender for Cloud.
