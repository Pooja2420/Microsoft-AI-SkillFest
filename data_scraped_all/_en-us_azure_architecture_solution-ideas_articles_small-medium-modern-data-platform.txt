Modern data platform for small and medium businesses using Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks
Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
This article describes how small and medium businesses (SMBs) can combine existing investments in Azure Databricks with a fully managed software as a service (SaaS) data platform such as Microsoft Fabric. SaaS data platforms are end-to-end data analytics solutions that integrate easily with tools like Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI Services, Power Platform, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and other Microsoft technologies.

The interoperability between Azure Databricks and Microsoft Fabric provides a robust solution that minimizes data fragmentation while enhancing analytical capabilities.
Microsoft Fabric provides an open and governed data lake, called OneLake, as the underlying SaaS storage. OneLake uses the Delta Parquet format, which is the same format that Azure Databricks uses. To access your Azure Databricks data from OneLake, you can useOneLake shortcutsin Fabric ormirror the Azure Databricks Unity Catalogin Fabric. This integration allows you to augment your Azure Databricks analytics systems with generative AI on top of OneLake.
You can also use the direct lake mode in Power BI on your Azure Databricks data in OneLake. Direct lake mode simplifies the serving layer and improves report performance. OneLake supports APIs for Azure Data Lake Storage and stores all tabular data in Delta Parquet format.
As a result, Azure Databricks notebooks can use OneLake endpoints to access the stored data. The experience is the same as accessing the data through a Microsoft Fabric warehouse. This integration allows you to use Fabric or Azure Databricks without reshaping your data.

Scenario details
Small and medium businesses that have an existing Azure Databricks environment, and optionally, a lakehouse architecture, can benefit from this pattern. They currently use an Azure extract, transform, load tool such as Azure Data Factory and serve reports in Power BI. However, they might also have multiple data sources that use different proprietary data formats on the same data lake, which leads to data duplication and concerns about vendor lock-in. This situation can complicate data management and increase dependency on specific vendors. They might also require up-to-date and near real-time reporting for decision-making and be interested in adopting AI tools across their environment.
Microsoft Fabric is an open, unified, and governed SaaS foundation that you can use to:
Use OneLake to store, manage, and analyze data in a single location without concerns about vendor lock-in.
