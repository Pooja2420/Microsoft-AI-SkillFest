Note
Additional security services will be added to this article soon.
Azure Government
Azure Government uses the same underlying technologies as Azure (sometimes referred to as Azure Commercial or Azure Public), which includes the core components of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Both Azure and Azure Government have comprehensive security controls in place, and the Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data.
Azure Government is a physically isolated cloud environment dedicated to US federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and their partners. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to screened US persons. These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations such as the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810.
For more information about Azure Government, seeWhat is Azure Government?
Note
These lists and tables do not include feature or bundle availability in the Azure Government Secret or Azure Government Top Secret clouds.
For more information about specific availability for air-gapped clouds, please contact your account team.
Microsoft 365 integration
Integrations between products rely on interoperability between Azure and Office platforms. Offerings hosted in the Azure environment are accessible from the Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Government platforms. Office 365 and Office 365 GCC are paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure Government.
The following diagram displays the hierarchy of Microsoft clouds and how they relate to each other.

The Office 365 GCC environment helps customers comply with US government requirements, including FedRAMP High, CJIS, and IRS 1075. The Office 365 GCC High and DoD environments support customers who need compliance with DoD IL4/5, DFARS 7012, NIST 800-171, and ITAR.
For more information about Office 365 US Government environments, see:
Office 365 GCC
Office 365 GCC High and DoD
The following sections identify when a service has an integration with Microsoft 365 and the feature availability for Office 365 GCC, Office 365 High, and Office 365 DoD.
Azure Information Protection
Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content.
AIP is part of the Microsoft Purview Information Protection (MIP) solution, and extends thelabelingandclassificationfunctionality provided by Microsoft 365.
For more information, see theAzure Information Protection product documentation.
Office 365 GCC is paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure Government. Make sure to pay attention to the Azure environment to understand whereinteroperability is possible. In the following table, interoperability that isnotpossible is marked with a dash (-) to indicate that support is not relevant.

Microsoft Defender for IoT
Microsoft Defender for IoT lets you accelerate IoT/OT innovation with comprehensive security across all your IoT/OT devices.â¯For end-user organizations, Microsoft Defender for IoT offers agentless, network-layer security that is rapidly deployed, works with diverse industrial equipment, and interoperates with Microsoft Sentinel and other SOC tools. Deploy on-premises or in Azure-connected environments.â¯For IoT device builders, the Microsoft Defender for IoT security agents allow you to build security directly into your new IoT devices and Azure IoT projects. The micro agent has flexible deployment options, including the ability to deploy as a binary package or modify source code. And the micro agent is available for standard IoT operating systems like Linux and Azure RTOS. For more information, see theMicrosoft Defender for IoT product documentation.

Azure Attestation
Microsoft Azure Attestation is a unified solution for remotely verifying the trustworthiness of a platform and integrity of the binaries running inside it. The service receives evidence from the platform, validates it with security standards, evaluates it against configurable policies, and produces an attestation token for claims-based applications (e.g., relying parties, auditing authorities).
Azure Attestation is currently available in multiple regions across Azure public and Government clouds. In Azure Government, the service is available in preview status across US Gov Virginia and US Gov Arizona.
For more information, see Azure Attestationpublic documentation.
