Identify or create aRecovery Services vaultin the same region and subscription as the storage account that hosts the file share.
Create a backup policy for protection of Azure Files.
If the storage account access has restrictions, check the firewall settings of the account to ensure the exceptionAllow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage accountis in grant state. You can refer tothislink for the steps to grant an exception.
Ensure that you allow theStorage account key accessin the required storage account.
