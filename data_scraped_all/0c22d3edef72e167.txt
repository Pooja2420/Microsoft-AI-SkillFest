Azure Front Door enables secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) delivery to your applications by default when you use your own custom domains. To learn more about custom domains, including how custom domains work with HTTPS, seeDomains in Azure Front Door.
Azure Front Door supports Azure-managed certificates and customer-managed certificates. In this article, you learn how to configure both types of certificates for your Azure Front Door custom domains.
Prerequisites
An Azure Front Door profile. For more information, seeQuickstart: Create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium.
A custom domain. If you don't have a custom domain, you must first purchase one from a domain provider. For more information, seeBuy a custom domain name.
If you're using Azure to host yourDNS domains, you must delegate the domain provider's domain name system (DNS) to an Azure DNS. For more information, seeDelegate a domain to Azure DNS. Otherwise, if you're using a domain provider to handle your DNS domain, you must manually validate the domain by entering prompted DNS TXT records.
Azure Front Door-managed certificates for non-Azure prevalidated domains
If you have your own domain, and the domain isn't already associated withanother Azure service that prevalidates domains for Azure Front Door, follow these steps:
UnderSettings, selectDomainsfor your Azure Front Door profile. Then select+ Addto add a new domain.

Then selectAddto onboard the custom domain.SettingValueDomain typeSelectNon-Azure pre-validated domain.DNS managementSelectAzure managed DNS (Recommended).DNS zoneSelect the Azure DNS zone that hosts the custom domain.Custom domainSelect an existing domain or add a new domain.HTTPSSelectAFD managed (Recommended).

Validate and associate the custom domain to an endpoint by following the steps to enable acustom domain.

After the custom domain is successfully associated with an endpoint, Azure Front Door generates a certificate and deploys it. This process might take from several minutes to an hour to finish.

Use your own certificate
You can also choose to use your own TLS certificate. Your TLS certificate must meet certain requirements. For more information, seeCertificate requirements.
Create a separate Azure Key Vault instance in which you store your Azure Front Door TLS certificates. For more information, seeCreate a Key Vault instance. If you already have a certificate, you can upload it to your new Key Vault instance. Otherwise, you can create a new certificate through Key Vault from one of the certificate authority (CA) partners.
There are currently two ways to authenticate Azure Front Door to access your Key Vault:
Managed identity: Azure Front Door uses a managed identity to authenticate to your Key Vault. This method is recommended because it's more secure and doesn't require you to manage credentials. For more information, seeUse managed identities in Azure Front Door. Skip toSelect the certificate for Azure Front Door to deployif you're using this method.
App registration: Azure Front Door uses an app registration to authenticate to your Key Vault. This method is being deprecated and will be retired in the future. For more information, seeUse app registration in Azure Front Door.
Warning
Azure Front Door currently only supports Key Vault in the same subscription. Selecting Key Vault under a different subscription results in a failure.
Azure Front Door doesn't support certificates with elliptic curve cryptography algorithms. Also, your certificate must have a complete certificate chain with leaf and intermediate certificates. The root CA also must be part of theMicrosoft Trusted CA List.
Register the service principal for Azure Front Door as an app in your Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Graph PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
Note
This action requires you to have User Access Administrator permissions in Microsoft Entra ID. The registration only needs to be performedonce per Microsoft Entra tenant.
