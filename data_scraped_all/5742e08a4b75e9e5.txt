When you create a project, a process is used to specify the work item types to configure and other settings. Each process template primarily defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system for Azure Boards. For the Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models, you can upload a process template to either update an existing project or create a project. For the Inheritance process model, you customize work tracking through the web portal. For more information about these different processes, seeCustomize your work tracking experience.
You can upload and export process templates only for those project collections configured to use the On-premises XML processes. Also, you can mark a template to appear as the default when you add projects.

Tip
With Azure DevOps Server, you can choose between using theInherited process modelor theOn-premises XML process model. For more information, seeChoose the process model for your project collection. To access the latest versions of the default processes or process templates:
Inherited process model: Open theProcessespage. For more information, seeManage processes.

Import a process template (Hosted XML process)
From theProcessestab, chooseImport processand then drag-and-drop or browse to the zip file of the process you've customized.NoteIf you don't see theImport processlink, then your organization isn't set up to support the Hosted XML process model. You should work with theInheritance process modelfor your customization needs. The Hosted XML process model is only supported if your account was created through theData Import Service.

Correlate a process template with an existing project
To determine the type of process template that was used to create your project, review the work item types that appear in theNew Work Itemmenu for Team Explorer and then compare them with the work item types in the following chart. If your work item types differ from those items shown, then a custom process template might have been used.

Process template restrictions and validation checks
If you upload the process template through the web portal, you may come across errors such as those shown in the following image.

Resolve each error and then retry the upload process. You may find additional information about resolving process template errors fromResolve validation errors for process import.
The following validation checks must pass when uploading a process template.
Process template names must be unique and 256 Unicode characters or less. Same-named templates overwrite existing templates.
Also, names can't contain the following characters: . , ; ' ` : / \ * | ? " & % $ ! + = ( ) [ ] { } < >. For more restrictions, seeNaming restrictions.
Process template folders can't contain any .exe files. If they do, the process template may upload successfully, however project creation fails.
Process template total size should be 2 GB or less, or project creation fails.
The upload process runs a partial verification check to make sure that the XML of each process template XML file is valid. If you receive any errors when you try to upload the process template, review the XML to determine the cause of the error. Duplicate tags in an XML file can cause errors. If there's no error in the XML, check to make sure all the appropriate files are included in your process template in the correct folder locations.
If XML definition files reference an extension, then the extension must be installed and enabled in the collection.
Important
The schema definition for process templates uses a mix of camel-case and all capitalized elements. If you encounter errors when validating your type definition files, check the case structure of your elements. Also, the case structure of opening and closing tags must match according to the rules for XML syntax. See alsoProcess template plug-ins: Index to XML element definitions.
