This article shows you how to migrate on-premises VMware vSphere VMs to Azure, using theMigration and modernizationtool, with agent-based migration.  You can also migrate VMware vSphere VMs using agentless migration.Comparethe methods.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Prepare Azure to work with Azure Migrate.
Prepare for agent-based migration. Set up a VMware vCenter Server account so that Azure Migrate can discover machines for migration. Set up an account so that the Mobility service agent can install on machines you want to migrate, and prepare a machine to act as the replication appliance.
Add the Migration and modernization tool
Set up the replication appliance.
Replicate VMs.
Run a test migration to make sure everything's working as expected.
Run a full migration to Azure.
Note
Tutorials show you the simplest deployment path for a scenario so that you can quickly set up a proof-of-concept. Tutorials use default options where possible, and don't show all possible settings and paths.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial,reviewthe VMware vSphere agent-based migration architecture.
Prepare Azure
Complete the tasks in the table to prepare Azure for agent-based migration.
Assign permissions to create project
If you don't have an Azure Migrate project, verify permissions to create one.
In the Azure portal, open the subscription, and selectAccess control (IAM).
In the Azure portal, open the subscription, and selectAccess control (IAM).
InCheck access, find the relevant account, and select it to view permissions.

Verify that you haveContributororOwnerpermissions.
If you just created a free Azure account, you're the owner of your subscription.
If you're not the subscription owner, work with the owner to assign the role.
Assign Azure account permissions
Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the account, so that you have permissions to:
Create a VM in the selected resource group.
Create a VM in the selected virtual network.
Write to an Azure managed disk.

Assign permissions to register the Replication Appliance in Microsoft Entra ID
If you are following the least privilege principle, assign theApplication DeveloperMicrosoft Entra role to the user registering the Replication Appliance. Follow theAssign administrator and non-administrator roles to users with Microsoft Entra IDguide to do so.
Important
If the user registering the Replication Appliance is a Microsoft Entra Global Administrator, that user already has the required permissions.
Set up an Azure network
Set up an Azure network. On-premises machines are replicated to Azure managed disks. When you fail over to Azure for migration, Azure VMs are created from these managed disks, and joined to the Azure network you set up.
Prepare for migration
Verify support requirements  and permissions, and prepare to deploy a replication appliance.
Prepare an account to discover VMs
The Migration and modernization tool needs access to VMware vSphere to discover VMs you want to migrate. Create the account as follows:
To use a dedicated account, create a role at the vCenter Server level. Give the role a name such asAzure_Migrate.
Assign the role the permissions summarized in the table below.
Create a user on the vCenter Server or vSphere host. Assign the role to the user.
Prepare an account for Mobility service installation
The Mobility service must be installed on machines you want to replicate.
The Azure Migrate replication appliance can do a push installation of this service when you enable replication for a machine, or you can install it manually, or using installation tools.
In this tutorial, we're going to install the Mobility service with the push installation.
For push installation, you need to prepare an account that the Migration and modernization tool can use to access the VM. This account is used only for the push installation, if you don't install the Mobility service manually.
Prepare the account as follows:
Prepare a domain or local account with permissions to install on the VM.
For Windows VMs, if you're not using a domain account, disable Remote User Access control on the local machine by adding the DWORD entryLocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, with a value of 1 in the registry, underHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
For Linux VMs, prepare a root account on the source Linux server.
Prepare a machine for the replication appliance
The appliance is used to replication machines to Azure. The appliance is single, highly available, on-premises VMware vSphere VM that hosts these components:
Configuration server: The configuration server coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure, and manages data replication.
Process server: The process server acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption, and sends it to a cache storage account in Azure. The process server also installs the Mobility Service agent on VMs you want to replicate, and performs automatic discovery of on-premises VMware VMs.
Prepare for the appliance as follows:
Review appliance requirements. Generally, you set up the replication appliance a VMware vSphere VM using a downloaded OVA file. The template creates an appliance that complies with all requirements.
MySQL must be installed on the appliance.Reviewinstallation methods.
Review thepublic cloud URLs, andAzure Government URLsthat the appliance machine needs to access.
Review the portsthat the replication appliance machine needs to access.
Check VMware vSphere requirements
Make sure VMware vSphere VMs comply with requirements for migration to Azure.
VerifyVMware vSphere VM requirements.
VerifyVM requirements for migration.
Verify Azure settings. On-premises VMs you replicate to Azure must comply withAzure VM requirements.
There are some changes needed on VMs before you migrate them to Azure.It's important to make these changes before you begin migration. If you migrate the VM before you make the change, the VM might not boot up in Azure.ReviewWindowsandLinuxchanges you need to make.

Note
Agent-based migration with the Migration and modernization tool is based on features of the Azure Site Recovery service. Some requirements might link to Site Recovery documentation.
Set up the replication appliance
This procedure describes how to set up the appliance with a downloaded Open Virtualization Application (OVA) template. If you can't use this method, you can set up the applianceusing a script.

Replication occurs as follows:
When the Start Replication job finishes successfully, the machines begin their initial replication to Azure.
After initial replication finishes, delta replication begins. Incremental changes to on-premises disks are periodically replicated to the replica disks in Azure.
Run a test migration
When delta replication begins, you can run a test migration for the VMs, before running a full migration to Azure. We highly recommend that you do this at least once for each machine, before you migrate it.
Running a test migration checks that migration will work as expected, without impacting the on-premises machines, which remain operational, and continue replicating.
Test migration simulates the migration by creating an Azure VM using replicated data (usually migrating to a non-production VNet in your Azure subscription).
You can use the replicated test Azure VM to validate the migration, perform app testing, and address any issues before full migration.
Do a test migration as follows:
InMigration goals>Servers, databases and web apps>Migration and modernization, selectTest migrated servers.
