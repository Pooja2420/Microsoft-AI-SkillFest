In this article, you learn how to associate a public IP address to an existing virtual machine (VM). To do so, you associate the public IP address to an IP configuration of a network interface attached to a VM. You can use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell by selecting the tab for the method you want to use.
If you want to instead create a new VM with a public IP address, you can use theAzure portal, theAzure CLI, orAzure PowerShell.
Public IP addresses have a nominal fee. For details, seepricing. There's a limit to the number of public IP addresses that you can use per subscription. For details, seelimits.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription. You cancreate an account for free.
Azure portal

Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
In the portal, search for and select the VM that you want to add the public IP address to.
In the portal, search for and select the VM that you want to add the public IP address to.
UnderSettingsin the left pane, selectNetworking, and then select the network interface you want to add the public IP address to.NotePublic IP addresses are associated to the network interfaces that are attached to a VM. In this screenshot, the VM has only one network interface. If the VM had multiple network interfaces, they would all appear, and you'd select the network interface you want to associate the public IP address to.

In theEdit IP configurationwindow, selectAssociate public IP address, then selectPublic IP addressto choose an existing public IP address from the drop-down list. If no public IP addresses are listed, you need to create one. To learn how, seeCreate a public IP address.NoteThe public IP addresses that appear in the drop-down list are those that exist in the same region as the VM. If you have multiple public IP addresses created in the region, all will appear here. Any address that's already associated to a different resource is grayed out.

Use theaz network nic ip-config updatecommand to associate a public IP address to an IP configuration. The following example associates an existing public IP address namedmyPublicIPto an IP configuration namedipconfig1. This IP configuration belongs to an existing network interface namedmyVMNicin a resource group namedmyResourceGroup.az network nic ip-config update \
  --name ipconfig1 \

Note
To share a VM with an external user, you must add a public IP address to the VM. Alternatively, external users can connect to VM's private IP address through Azure Bastion.
Allow network traffic to the VM
Before you can connect to a public IP address from the internet, you must open the necessary ports/protocols in your network security groups. These ports must be open in any network security group that you might have associated to the network interface, the subnet of the network interface, or both. Although network security groups filter traffic to the private IP address of the network interface, after inbound internet traffic arrives at the public IP address, Azure translates the public address to the private IP address. Therefore, if a network security group prevents the traffic flow, the communication with the public IP address fails.
You can view the effective security rules for a network interface and its subnet for theAzure portal, theAzure CLI, orAzure PowerShell.
Limits
If a new public IP address is added to the VM and traffic needs to switch over to the new IP address, the VM needs to be restarted as this will reset all existing flows.
