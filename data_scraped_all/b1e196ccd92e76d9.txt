Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps you to meet regulatory compliance requirements by continuously assessing resources against compliance controls, and identifying issues that are blocking you from achieving a particular compliance certification.
In theRegulatory compliancedashboard, you manage and interact with compliance standards. You can see which compliance standards are assigned, turn standards on and off for Azure, AWS, and GCP, review the status of assessments against standards, and more.
Integration with Purview
Compliance data from Defender for Cloud now seamlessly integrates withMicrosoft Purview Compliance Manager, allowing you to centrally assess and manage compliance across your organization's entire digital estate.
When you add any standard to your compliance dashboard (including compliance standards monitoring other clouds like AWS and GCP), the resource-level compliance data is automatically surfaced in Compliance Manager for the same standard.
Compliance Manager thus provides improvement actions and status across your cloud infrastructure and all other digital assets in this central tool. For more information, seemulticloud support in Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager.
Before you start
By default, when you enable Defender for Cloud on an Azure subscription, AWS account, or GCP plan, the MCSB plan is enabled.
You can add more non-default compliance standards when at least one paid plan is enabled in Defender for Cloud.
You must be signed in with an account that has reader access to the policy compliance data. TheReaderrole for the subscription has access to the policy compliance data, but theSecurity Readerrole doesn't. At a minimum, you need to haveResource Policy ContributorandSecurity Adminroles assigned.
Assess regulatory compliance
TheRegulatory compliancedashboard shows which compliance standards are enabled. It shows the controls within each standard, and security assessments for those controls. The status of these assessments reflects your compliance with the standard.
The dashboard helps you to focus on gaps in standards, and to monitor compliance over time.
In the Defender for Cloud portal, open theRegulatory compliancepage.

You can also manually export reports about a single point in time directly from the regulatory compliance dashboard. Generate thesePDF/CSV reportsorAzure and Dynamics certification reportsusing theDownload reportorAudit reportstoolbar options.
Trigger a workflow when assessments change
Defender for Cloud's workflow automation feature can trigger Logic Apps whenever one of your regulatory compliance assessments changes state.
For example, you might want Defender for Cloud to email a specific user when a compliance assessment fails. You need to first create the logic app (usingAzure Logic Apps)  and then set up the trigger in a new workflow automation as explained inAutomate responses to Defender for Cloud triggers.
