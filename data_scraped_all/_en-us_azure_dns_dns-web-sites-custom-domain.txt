You can configure Azure DNS to host a custom domain for your web apps. For example, you can create an Azure web app and have your users access it using eitherwww.contoso.comorcontoso.comas a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
www.contoso.com
contoso.com
To do this, you have to create three records:
A root "A" record pointing to contoso.com
A root "TXT" record for verification
A "CNAME" record for the www name that points to the A record
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create an A and TXT record for your custom domain
Create a CNAME record for your custom domain
Test the new records
Add custom host names to your web app
Test the custom host names
If you donât have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.

A domain name that you can host in Azure DNS. You must have full control of this domain. Full control includes the ability to set the name server (NS) records for the domain.

Azure Cloud Shell
Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.
To start Azure Cloud Shell:
To use Azure Cloud Shell:

Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create the A record
An A record is used to map a name to its IP address. In the following example, assign "@" as an A record using your web app IPv4 address. @ typically represents the root domain.
Get the IPv4 address
In the left navigation of the App Services page in the Azure portal, selectCustom domains, then copy the IP address of your web app:

Create the record
To create the A record, use:
New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name "@" -RecordType "A" -ZoneName "contoso.com" `
 -ResourceGroupName "MyAzureResourceGroup" -Ttl 600 `
 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address "<ip of web app service>")
New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name "@" -RecordType "A" -ZoneName "contoso.com" `
 -ResourceGroupName "MyAzureResourceGroup" -Ttl 600 `
 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address "<ip of web app service>")
Important
The A record must be manually updated if the underlying IP address for the web app changes.
Create the TXT record
App Services uses this record only at configuration time to verify that you own the custom domain. You can delete this TXT record after your custom domain is validated and configured in App Service.
Note
If you want to verify the domain name, but not route production traffic to the web app, you only need to specify the TXT record for the verification step.  Verification does not require an A or CNAME record in addition to the TXT record.
To create the TXT record, use:
New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup `
 -Name "@" -RecordType "txt" -Ttl 600 `
 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Value  "contoso.azurewebsites.net")
New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup `
 -Name "@" -RecordType "txt" -Ttl 600 `
 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Value  "contoso.azurewebsites.net")
Create the CNAME record
If your domain is already managed by Azure DNS (seeDNS domain delegation), you can use the following example to create a CNAME record for contoso.azurewebsites.net. The CNAME created in this example has a "time to live" of 600 seconds in DNS zone named "contoso.com" with the alias for the web app contoso.azurewebsites.net.
New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName "MyAzureResourceGroup" `
 -Name "www" -RecordType "CNAME" -Ttl 600 `
 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -cname "contoso.azurewebsites.net")
New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName "MyAzureResourceGroup" `
 -Name "www" -RecordType "CNAME" -Ttl 600 `
 -DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -cname "contoso.azurewebsites.net")
The following example is the response:
Name              : www
    ZoneName          : contoso.com
    ResourceGroupName : myazureresourcegroup
    Ttl               : 600
    Etag              : 8baceeb9-4c2c-4608-a22c-229923ee185
    RecordType        : CNAME
    Records           : {contoso.azurewebsites.net}
    Tags              : {}
Name              : www
    ZoneName          : contoso.com
    ResourceGroupName : myazureresourcegroup
    Ttl               : 600
    Etag              : 8baceeb9-4c2c-4608-a22c-229923ee185
    RecordType        : CNAME
    Records           : {contoso.azurewebsites.net}
    Tags              : {}
Test the new records
You can validate the records were created correctly by querying the "www.contoso.com"  and "contoso.com" using nslookup, as shown below:
PS C:\> nslookup
Default Server:  Default
Address:  192.168.0.1

> www.contoso.com
Server:  default server
Address:  192.168.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    <instance of web app service>.cloudapp.net
Address:  <ip of web app service>
Aliases:  www.contoso.com
contoso.azurewebsites.net
<instance of web app service>.vip.azurewebsites.windows.net

> contoso.com

Address:  192.168.0.1

Non-authoritative answer:
contoso.com text =

        "contoso.azurewebsites.net"
Add custom host names
Now, you can add the custom host names to your web app:
set-AzWebApp `
 -Name contoso `
 -ResourceGroupName <your web app resource group> `
 -HostNames @("contoso.com","www.contoso.com","contoso.azurewebsites.net")
set-AzWebApp `
 -Name contoso `
 -ResourceGroupName <your web app resource group> `
 -HostNames @("contoso.com","www.contoso.com","contoso.azurewebsites.net")
Test the custom host names
Open a browser and browse tohttp://www.<your domain name>andhttp://<you domain name>.
http://www.<your domain name>
http://<you domain name>
Note
Make sure you include thehttp://prefix, otherwise your browser may attempt to predict a URL for you!
http://
You should see the same page for both URLs. For example:

Clean up resources
When no longer needed, you can delete all resources created in this tutorial by deleting the resource groupMyAzureResourceGroup:
On the Azure portal menu, selectResource groups.
Select theMyAzureResourceGroupresource group.
On theOverviewpage, selectDelete resource group.
EnterMyAzureResourceGroupand selectDelete.
