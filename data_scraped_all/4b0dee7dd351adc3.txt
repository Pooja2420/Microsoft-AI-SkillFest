Remarks
For more information about using triggers with a specific repository type, seeSupported source repositories.
If you specify no push trigger, pushes to any branch trigger a build.
YAML pipelines are configured by default with a CI trigger on all branches, unless theDisable implied YAML CI triggersetting is enabled. TheDisable implied YAML CI triggersetting can be configured at the organization level or at the project level. When theDisable implied YAML CI triggersetting is enabled, CI triggers for YAML pipelines are not enabled if the YAML pipeline doesn't have atriggersection. The default value forDisable implied YAML CI triggerisfalse.
trigger
false
There are three distinct syntax options for thetriggerkeyword: a list of branches to include, a way to disable CI triggers, and the full syntax for complete control.
trigger
If you specify anexcludeclause without anincludeclause forbranches,tags, orpaths, it is equivalent to specifying*in theincludeclause.
exclude
include
branches
tags
paths
*
include

trigger: none
Disable CI triggers.
trigger: none # Disable CI triggers.
trigger: none # Disable CI triggers.
triggerstring. Allowed values: none.
trigger

Examples
trigger: none # will disable CI builds entirely
trigger: none # will disable CI builds entirely

trigger: string list
List of branches that trigger a run.
trigger: [ string ] # List of branches that trigger a run.
trigger: [ string ] # List of branches that trigger a run.
List types
Examples
trigger:
- main
- develop
trigger:
- main
- develop

trigger: batch, branches, paths, tags
Use the full syntax control for full control over the CI trigger.
trigger:
  batch: boolean # Whether to batch changes per branch.
  branches: # Branch names to include or exclude for triggering a run.
    include: [ string ] # List of items to include.
    exclude: [ string ] # List of items to exclude.
  paths: # File paths to include or exclude for triggering a run.
    include: [ string ] # List of items to include.
    exclude: [ string ] # List of items to exclude.
  tags: # Tag names to include or exclude for triggering a run.
    include: [ string ] # List of items to include.
    exclude: [ string ] # List of items to exclude.
trigger:
  batch: boolean # Whether to batch changes per branch.
  branches: # Branch names to include or exclude for triggering a run.
    include: [ string ] # List of items to include.
    exclude: [ string ] # List of items to exclude.
  paths: # File paths to include or exclude for triggering a run.
    include: [ string ] # List of items to include.
    exclude: [ string ] # List of items to exclude.
  tags: # Tag names to include or exclude for triggering a run.
    include: [ string ] # List of items to include.
    exclude: [ string ] # List of items to exclude.

Remarks
If you have many team members uploading changes often, you may want to reduce the number of runs you start. If you setbatchtotrue, when a pipeline is running, the system waits until the run is completed, then starts another run with all changes that have not yet been built. By default,batchisfalse.
batch
true
batch
false
When specifying a branch, tag, or path, you may use an exact name or a wildcard. For more information, seewildcards.
Important
batchis not supported inrepository resourcetriggers.
