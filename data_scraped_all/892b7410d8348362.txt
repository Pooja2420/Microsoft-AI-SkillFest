An Azure VMware Solution private cloud comes with NSX by default. The private cloud comes pre-provisioned with an NSX Tier-0 gateway inActive/Activemode and a default NSX Tier-1 gateway in Active/Standby mode.  These gateways let you connect the segments (logical switches) and provide East-West and North-South connectivity.
After deploying Azure VMware Solution, you can configure the necessary NSX objects from the Azure portal.  It presents a simplified view of NSX operations a VMware administrator needs daily and is targeted at users not familiar with NSX Manager.
You have four options to configure NSX components in the Azure VMware Solution console:
Segments- Create segments that display in NSX Manager and vCenter Server. For more information, seeAdd an NSX segment using the Azure portal.
