You can save money with Fabric capacity reservation by committing to a reservation for your Fabric capacity usage for a duration of one year. This article explains how you can save money with Fabric capacity reservations.
To purchase a Fabric capacity reservation, you choose an Azure region, billing frequency, and the quantity of capacity units (CUs) that you want to purchase. Then you add the Fabric capacity reservation to your cart.
When you purchase a reservation, the Fabric capacity usage that matches the reservation attributes is no longer charged at the pay-as-you-go rates.
A reservation doesn't cover storage or networking charges associated with the Microsoft Fabric usage, it only covers Fabric capacity usage.
When the reservation expires, Fabric capacity workloads continue to run but are billed at the pay-as-you-go rate. Reservations don't renew automatically.
You can choose to enable automatic reservation renewal by selecting the option in the renewal settings. With automatic renewal, a replacement reservation is purchased when the reservation expires. By default, the replacement reservation has the same attributes as the expiring reservation. You can optionally change the billing frequency, term, or quantity in the renewal settings. Any user with owner access on the reservation and the subscription used for billing can set up renewal.
For pricing information, see theFabric pricing page.

How reservation discounts apply to Microsoft Fabric Capacity
After you buy a Fabric capacity reservation, the reservation discount is automatically applied to your provisioned instances that exist in that region. The reservation discount applies to the usage emitted by the Fabric capacity meters. Storage and networking aren't covered by the reservation and they're charged at pay-as-you-go rates.
Reservation discount application
The Fabric capacity reservation discount is applied to CUs on an hourly basis. If you don't have workloads consuming CUs for a full hour, you don't receive the full discount benefit of the reservation. It doesn't carry over.
After purchase, the reservation is matched to Fabric capacity usage emitted by running workloads (Power BI, Data Warehouse, and so on) at any point in time.
Discount examples
The following examples show how the Fabric capacity reservation discount applies, depending on the deployments.
Example 1- A reservation that's exactly the same size as the capacity. For example, you purchase 64 CUs of capacity and you deploy an F64. In this example, you only pay the reservation price.
Example 2- A reservation that's larger than your used capacity. For example, you buy 64 CUs of capacity and you only deploy an F32. In this example, the reservation discount is applied to the F32. For the remaining 32 CUs of unused reservation capacity, if you don't have matching resources for any hour. You lose the reservation quantity for that hour. You can't carry forward unused reserved hours.
Example 3- A reservation that's smaller than the used capacity. For example, you buy 64 CUs of capacity and you deploy an F128. In this example, your discount is applied to 64 CUs that were used. For the remaining 64 CUs, you pay the pay-as-you-go rate.
Example 4- A reservation that's the same size as two used capacities that equal the size of the reservation. For example, you buy 64 CUs of capacity and you deploy two F32s. In this example, the discount is applied to all used capacity.
Example 5- This example explains the relationship between smoothing and reservations. Smoothing is a feature of Fabric and allows spikes in usage to be spread out over time. Smoothing spreads background process like Spark jobs and semantic model refreshes over a 24-hour interval. Interactive process like Power BI reports, KQL, and SQL queries are spread out of a 10-minute interval. For more information, see the detailed explanation atSmoothing.For example, You purchase a Fabric capacity reservation of two CUs, and assume that your usage spikes to 4 CUs for an hour. The process runs and consumes 4 CUs, however, the CU usage is spread out of the 24 hours. This feature allows you to purchase for average workload rather than the peak. Review the link provided to understand the effect of smoothing if you use more CU that available over 24 hours.
