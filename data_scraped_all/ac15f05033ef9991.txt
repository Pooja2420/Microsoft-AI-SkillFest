In this guide, you learnhow to migrateyour Microsoft Access database to an Azure SQL database by usingSQL Server MigrationAssistant for Access (SSMA for Access).
For other migration guides, seeAzure Database Migration Guide.
Prerequisites
Before you begin migrating your Access database to a SQL database, do the following:
Verify that your source environment is supported.
Download and installSQL Server Migration Assistant for Access.
Ensure that you have connectivity and sufficient permissions to access both source and target.
Pre-migration
After you've met the prerequisites, you're ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of yourAzure cloud migration.
Assess
Use SSMA for Access to review database objects and data, and assess databases for migration.
To create an assessment, do the following:
OpenSSMA for Access.

SelectFile, and then selectNew Project.
SelectFile, and then selectNew Project.
Provide a project name and a location for your project and then, in the drop-down list, selectAzure SQL Databaseas the migration target.

SelectOK.
SelectOK.

SelectAdd Databases, and then select the databases to be added to your new project.

Review the HTML report to understand the conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Access objects and understand the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects. For example:drive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyAccessMigration\report\report_<date>

Validate the data types
Validate the default data type mappings, and change them based on your requirements, if necessary. To do so:
In SSMA for Access, selectTools, and then selectProject Settings.

You can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table name on theAccess Metadata Explorerpane.

Convert the schema
To convert database objects, do the following:
Select theConnect to Azure SQL Databasetab, and then do the following:a. Enter the details for connecting to your SQL database.b. In the drop-down list, select your target SQL database. Or you can enter a new name, in which case a database will be created on the target server.c. Provide authentication details.d. SelectConnect.

On theAccess Metadata Explorerpane, right-click the database, and then selectConvert Schema. Alternatively, you can select your database and then select theConvert Schematab.

After the conversion is completed, compare the converted objects to the original objects to identify potential problems, and address the problems based on the recommendations.Compare the converted Transact-SQL text to the original code, and review the recommendations.

Save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. To do so, selectFile>Save Project. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you publish them to your SQL database.

Migrate the databases
After you've assessed your databases and addressed any discrepancies, you can run the migration process. Migrating data is a bulk-load operation that moves rows of data into an Azure SQL database in transactions. The number of rows to be loaded into your SQL database in each transaction is configured in the project settings.
To publish your schema and migrate the data by using SSMA for Access, do the following:
If you haven't already done so, selectConnect to Azure SQL Database, and provide connection details.
If you haven't already done so, selectConnect to Azure SQL Database, and provide connection details.
Publish the schema. On theAzure SQL Database Metadata Explorerpane, right-click the database you're working with, and then selectSynchronize with Database. This action publishes the MySQL schema to the SQL database.

Migrate the data. Right-click the database or object you want to migrate, and then selectMigrate Data. Alternatively, you can select theMigrate Datatab at the upper right.To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expandTables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box.

Post-migration
After you've successfully completed themigrationstage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
Remediate applications
After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this will in some cases require changes to the applications.
Perform tests
The test approach to database migration consists of the following activities:
Develop validation tests: To test the database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you've defined.

Set up a test environment: The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

Optimize
The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues, verifying completeness, and addressing performance issues with the workload.
For more information about these issues and the steps to mitigate them, see thePost-migration validation and optimization guide.
Migration assets
For more assistance with completing this migration scenario, see the following resource. It was developed in support of a real-world migration project engagement.
The Data SQL Engineering team developed these resources. This team's core charter is to unblock and accelerate complex modernization for data platform migration projects to Microsoft's Azure data platform.
