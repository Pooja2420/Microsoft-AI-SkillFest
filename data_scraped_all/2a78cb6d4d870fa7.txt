Azure Monitor endpoint access and firewall configuration

If your monitored application or infrastructure is behind a firewall, you need to configure network access to allow communication withAzure Monitorservices.
Azure Monitor usesservice tags, which provide a more reliable and dynamic way to manage network access. Service tags are regularly updated and can be retrieved through an API, ensuring that you have the latest available IP address information without requiring manual updates.
If you're usingAzure network security groups, you can manage access withAzure network service tags. For hybrid or on-premises resources, you can download the equivalent IP address lists asJSON files, which are refreshed weekly. To cover all necessary exceptions, use the service tagsActionGroup,ApplicationInsightsAvailability, andAzureMonitor. For more information, seeAzure Service Tags Overview.
ActionGroup
ApplicationInsightsAvailability
AzureMonitor
Note
All Application Insights traffic represents outbound traffic except for availability monitoring and webhook action groups, which also require inbound firewall rules.
Service tags don't replace validation/authentication checks required for cross-tenant communications between a customer's Azure resource and other service tag resources.
Outgoing ports
You need to open some outgoing ports in your server's firewall to allow the Application Insights SDK or Application Insights Agent to send data to the portal.

Action group webhooks
You can query the list of IP addresses used by action groups by using theGet-AzNetworkServiceTag PowerShell command.
Action group service tag
Managing changes to source IP addresses can be time consuming. Usingservice tagseliminates the need to update your configuration. A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes from a specific Azure service. Microsoft manages the IP addresses and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change, which eliminates the need to update network security rules for an action group.
In the Azure portal underAzure Services, search forNetwork Security Group.

Frequently asked questions
This section provides answers to common questions.
Yes, but you need to allow traffic to our services by either firewall exceptions or proxy redirects.
SeeIP addresses used by Azure Monitorto review our full list of services and IP addresses.
Route traffic from your server to a gateway on your intranet by overwriting endpoints in your configuration. If theEndpointproperties aren't present in your config, these classes use the default values which are documented inIP addresses used by Azure Monitor.
Endpoint
Your gateway should route traffic to our endpoint's base address. In your configuration, replace the default values withhttp://<your.gateway.address>/<relative path>.
http://<your.gateway.address>/<relative path>
If your product doesn't support service tags, take the following steps to ensure full connectivity:
Check the latest IP ranges in thedownloadable Azure IP ranges and service tags JSON file, which updates weekly.
Review firewall logs for blocked requests and update your allowlist as needed.
For more information, seeAzure Service Tags Overview.
