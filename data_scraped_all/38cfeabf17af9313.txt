This checklist presents a set of recommendations for you to use to evaluate the reliability, resiliency, and failure recovery strategies in your architecture design. To ensure reliability, identify the best infrastructure and application design for your workload. Make these decisions based on your business requirements that are mapped to availability and recoverability target metrics.
To implement a reliable design, thoroughly consider decision points in your design and be aware of how those decisions affect your workload. This checklist and the accompanying guides provide resources to help you make those decisions. Make workload reliability a central consideration throughout the workload design, development, and operation lifecycle.
Checklist
Approach your design with a focus on reliability to help ensure that you design a workload that's resilient, manageable, and repeatable. If you don't include reliability practices and consider the tradeoffs, your design is potentially at risk. Carefully consider all the points covered in the checklist to instill confidence in your system's success.
