This article provides an overview of Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and includes an introduction toDNSSEC terminology. Benefits of DNSSEC zone signing are described and examples are provided for viewing DNSSEC related resource records. When you are ready to sign your Azure public DNS zone, see the following how-to guides:
How to sign your Azure Public DNS zone with DNSSEC.
How to unsign your Azure Public DNS zone
What is DNSSEC?
DNSSEC is a suite of extensions that add security to the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol by enabling DNS responses to be validated as genuine. DNSSEC provides origin authority, data integrity, and authenticated denial of existence. With DNSSEC, the DNS protocol is much less susceptible to certain types of attacks, particularly DNS spoofing attacks.
The core DNSSEC extensions are specified in the following Request for Comments (RFCs):
RFC 4033: "DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"
RFC 4034: "Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions"
RFC 4035: "Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"
For a summary of DNSSEC RFCs, seeRFC9364: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
How DNSSEC works
DNS zones are secured with DNSSEC using a process called zone signing. Signing a zone with DNSSEC adds validation support without changing the basic mechanism of a DNS query and response. To sign a zone with DNSSEC, the zone's primary authoritative DNS server must support DNSSEC.
Resource Record Signatures (RRSIGs) and other cryptographic records are added to the zone when it's signed. The following figure shows DNS resource records in the zone contoso.com before and after zone signing.

DNSSEC validationof DNS responses occurs by using these digital signatures with an unbrokenchain of trust.
Note
DNSSEC-related resource records aren't displayed in the Azure portal. For more information, seeView DNSSEC-related resource records.
Why sign a zone with DNSSEC?
Signing a zone with DNSSEC is required for compliance with some security guidelines, such as SC-20: Secure Name/Address Resolution Service.
DNSSEC validation of DNS responses can prevent common types of DNS hijacking attacks, also known as DNS redirection. DNS hijacking occurs when a client device is redirected to a malicious server by using incorrect (spoofed) DNS responses. DNS cache poisoning is a common method used to spoof DNS responses.
An example of how DNS hijacking works is shown in the following figure.

Normal DNS resolution:
A client device sends a DNS query forcontoso.comto a DNS server.
The DNS server responds with a DNS resource record forcontoso.com.
The client device requests a response fromcontoso.com.
The contoso.com app or web server returns a response to the client.
DNS hijacking
A client device sends a DNS query forcontoso.comto a hijacked DNS server.
The DNS server responds with an invalid (spoofed) DNS resource record forcontoso.com.
The client device requests a response forcontoso.comfrom malicious server.
The malicious server returns a spoofed response to the client.
The type of DNS resource record that is spoofed depends on the type of DNS hijacking attack. An MX record might be spoofed to redirect client emails, or a spoofed A record might send clients to a malicious web server.
DNSSEC works to prevent DNS hijacking by performing validation on DNS responses. In the DNS hijacking scenario pictured here, the client device can reject non-validated DNS responses if the contoso.com domain is signed with DNSSEC. To reject non-validated DNS responses, the client device must enforceDNSSEC validationfor contoso.com.
DNSSEC also includes Next Secure 3 (NSEC3) to prevent zone enumeration. Zone enumeration, also known as zone walking, is an attack whereby the attacker establishes a list of all names in a zone, including child zones.
Before you sign a zone with DNSSEC, be sure to understandhow DNSSEC works. When you are ready to sign a zone, seeHow to sign your Azure Public DNS zone with DNSSEC.
DNSSEC validation
If a DNS server is DNSSEC-aware, it can set the DNSSEC OK (DO) flag in a DNS query to a value of1. This value tells the responding DNS server to include DNSSEC-related resource records with the response. These DNSSEC records are Resource Record Signature (RRSIG) records that are used to validate that the DNS response is genuine.
1
A recursive (non-authoritative) DNS server performs DNSSEC validation on RRSIG records using atrust anchor(DNSKEY). The server uses a DNSKEY to decrypt digital signatures in RRSIG records (and other DNSSEC-related records), and then computes and compares hash values. If hash values are the same, it provides a reply to the DNS client with the DNS data that it requested, such as a host address (A) record. See the following diagram:

If hash values aren't the same, the recursive DNS server replies with a SERVFAIL message. In this way, DNSSEC-capable resolving (or forwarding) DNS servers with a valid trust anchor installed can protect against DNS hijacking in the path between the recursive server and the authoritative server. This protection doesn't require DNS client devices to be DNSSEC-aware or to enforce DNS response validation, provided the local (last hop) recursive DNS server is itself secure from hijacking.
Windows 10 and Windows 11 client devices arenonvalidating security-aware stub resolvers. These client devices don't perform validation, but can enforce DNSSEC validation using Group Policy.The NRPTcan be used to create and enforce namespace based DNSSEC validation policy.
Trust anchors and DNSSEC validation
Note
DNSSEC response validation is not performed by the default Azure-provided resolver. The information in this section is helpful if you are setting up your own recursive DNS servers for DNSSEC validation or troubleshooting validation issues.
Trust anchors operate based on the DNS namespace hierarchy. A recursive DNS server can have any number of trust anchors, or no trust anchors. Trust anchors can be added for a single child DNS zone, or any parent zone. If a recursive DNS server has a root (.) trust anchor, then it can perform DNSSEC validation on any DNS zone. For more information, seeRoot Zone Operator Information.
The DNSSEC validation process works with trust anchors as follows:
If a recursive DNS server doesn't have a DNSSEC trust anchor for a zone or the zone's parent hierarchical namespace, it will not perform DNSSEC validation on that zone.
If a recursive DNS server has a DNSSEC trust anchor for a zone's parent namespace and it receives a query for the child zone, it checks to see if a DS record for the child zones is present in the parent zone.If the DS record is found, the recursive DNS server performs DNSSEC validation.If the recursive DNS server determines that the parent zone doesn't have a DS record for the child zone, it assumes the child zone is insecure and doesn't perform DNSSEC validation.
If the DS record is found, the recursive DNS server performs DNSSEC validation.
If the recursive DNS server determines that the parent zone doesn't have a DS record for the child zone, it assumes the child zone is insecure and doesn't perform DNSSEC validation.
If multiple recursive DNS servers are involved in a DNS response (including forwarders), each server must be able to perform DNSSEC validation on the response so that there is an unbroken chain of trust.
Recursive servers that have DNSSEC validation disabled or aren't DNSSEC-aware don't perform validation.
Chain of trust
A chain of trust occurs when all the DNS servers involved in sending a response for a DNS query are able to validate that the response wasn't modified during transit. In order for DNSSEC validation to work end-to-end, the chain of trust must be unbroken. This chain of trust applies to both authoritative and non-authoritative (recursive) servers.
Authoritative servers
Authoritative DNS servers maintain a chain of trust through the use of delegation signer (DS) records. DS records are used to verify the authenticity of child zones in the DNS hierarchy.
In order for DNSSEC validation to occur on a signed zone, the parent of the signed zone must also be signed. The parent zone also must have a DS record for the child zone.
During the validation process, a zone's parent is queried for the DS record. If the DS record is not present, or the DS record data in the parent does not match the DNSKEY data in the child zone, the chain of trust is broken and validation fails.
Recursive servers
Recursive DNS servers (also called resolving or caching DNS servers) maintain a chain of trust through the use of DNSSEC trust anchors.
The trust anchor is a DNSKEY record, or DS record containing ahashof a DNSKEY record. The DNSKEY record is created on an authoritative server when a zone is signed, and removed from the zone if the zone is unsigned.
Trust anchors must be manually installed on recursive DNS servers.
If a trust anchor for a parent zone is present, a recursive server can validate all child zones in the hierarchical namespace. This includes forwarded queries. To support DNSSEC validation of all DNSSEC-signed DNS zones, you can install a trust anchor for the root (.) zone.
Key rollover
The zone signing key (ZSK) in a DNSSEC-signed zone is periodically rolled over (replaced) automatically by Azure. It should not be necessary to replace your key signing key (KSK), but this option is available by contacting Microsoft support. Replacing the KSK requires that you also update your DS record in the parent zone.
Zone signing Algorithm
Zones are DNSSEC signed using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSAP256SHA256).
DNSSEC-related resource records
The following table provides a short description of DNSSEC-related records. For more detailed information, seeRFC 4034: Resource Records for the DNS Security ExtensionsandRFC 7344: Automating DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance.
View DNSSEC-related resource records
DNSSEC-related records are not displayed in the Azure portal. To view DNSSEC-related records, use command line tools such as Resolve-DnsName or dig.exe. These tools are available using Cloud Shell, or locally if installed on your device. Be sure to set the DO flag in your query by using the-dnssecokoption in Resolve-DnsName or the+dnssecoption in dig.exe.

Important
Don't use the nslookup.exe command-line tool to query for DNSSEC-related records. The nslookup.exe tool uses an internal DNS client that isn't DNSSEC-aware.
