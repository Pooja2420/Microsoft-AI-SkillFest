UseAzure Pipelinesto automatically deploy to Azure Functions. Azure Pipelines lets you build, test, and deploy with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) usingAzure DevOps.
YAML pipelines are defined using a YAML file in your repository. A step is the smallest building block of a pipeline and can be a script or task (prepackaged script).Learn about the key concepts and components that make up a pipeline.
You'll use theAzureFunctionApptask to deploy to Azure Functions. There are now two versions of the AzureFunctionApp task (AzureFunctionApp@1,AzureFunctionApp@2).AzureFunctionApp@2includes enhanced validation support that makes pipelines less likely to fail because of errors.
AzureFunctionApp
AzureFunctionApp@2
Choose your task version at the top of the article. YAML pipelines aren't available for Azure DevOps 2019 and earlier.
Note
TheAzureFunctionApp@2is highly recommended. Deploying to an app on theFlex Consumptionplan is only supported in version 2.

- task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@1 # Add this at the end of your file
  inputs:
    buildType: 'current'
    downloadType: 'single'
    artifactName: 'drop'
    itemPattern: '**/*.zip'
    downloadPath: '$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)'
- task: AzureFunctionApp@1

    appName: $(appName)
    package: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/**/*.zip
    #Uncomment the next lines to deploy to a deployment slot
    #Note that deployment slots is not supported for Linux Dynamic SKU
    #deployToSlotOrASE: true
    #resourceGroupName: '<Resource Group Name>'
    #slotName: '<Slot name>'
The snippet assumes that the build steps in your YAML file produce the zip archive in the$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)folder on your agent.
$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)
Deploy a container
You can automatically deploy your code as a containerized function app after every successful build. To learn more about containers, seeWorking with containers and Azure Functions.
The simplest way to deploy to a container is to use theAzure Function App on Container Deploy task.
To deploy, add the following snippet at the end of your YAML file:
trigger:
- main

variables:
  # Container registry service connection established during pipeline creation
  dockerRegistryServiceConnection: <Docker registry service connection>
  imageRepository: <Name of your image repository>
  containerRegistry: <Name of the Azure container registry>
  dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'

  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'

- task: AzureFunctionAppContainer@1 # Add this at the end of your file
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<Azure service connection>'
    appName: '<Name of the function app>'
    imageName: $(containerRegistry)/$(imageRepository):$(tag)
trigger:
- main

variables:
  # Container registry service connection established during pipeline creation
  dockerRegistryServiceConnection: <Docker registry service connection>
  imageRepository: <Name of your image repository>
  containerRegistry: <Name of the Azure container registry>
  dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'

  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'

- task: AzureFunctionAppContainer@1 # Add this at the end of your file
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<Azure service connection>'
    appName: '<Name of the function app>'
    imageName: $(containerRegistry)/$(imageRepository):$(tag)
The snippet pushes the Docker image to your Azure Container Registry. TheAzure Function App on Container Deploytask pulls the appropriate Docker image corresponding to theBuildIdfrom the repository specified, and then deploys the image.
BuildId
For a complete end-to-end pipeline example, including building the container and publishing to the container registry, seethis Azure Pipelines container deployment example.
Deploy to a slot
You can configure your function app to have multiple slots. Slots allow you to safely deploy your app and test it before making it available to your customers.
The following YAML snippet shows how to deploy to a staging slot, and then swap to a production slot:
- task: AzureFunctionApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: <Azure service connection>
    appType: functionAppLinux
    appName: <Name of the Function app>
    package: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/**/*.zip
    deployToSlotOrASE: true
    resourceGroupName: <Name of the resource group>
    slotName: staging

- task: AzureAppServiceManage@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: <Azure service connection>
    WebAppName: <name of the Function app>
    ResourceGroupName: <name of resource group>
    SourceSlot: staging
    SwapWithProduction: true
- task: AzureFunctionApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: <Azure service connection>
    appType: functionAppLinux
    appName: <Name of the Function app>
    package: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/**/*.zip
    deployToSlotOrASE: true
    resourceGroupName: <Name of the resource group>
    slotName: staging

- task: AzureAppServiceManage@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: <Azure service connection>
    WebAppName: <name of the Function app>
    ResourceGroupName: <name of resource group>
    SourceSlot: staging
    SwapWithProduction: true
Create a pipeline with Azure CLI
To create a build pipeline in Azure, use theaz functionapp devops-pipeline createcommand. The build pipeline is created to build and release any code changes that are made in your repo. The command generates a new YAML file that defines the build and release pipeline and then commits it to your repo. The prerequisites for this command depend on the location of your code.

The snippet assumes that the build steps in your YAML file produce the zip archive in the$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)folder on your agent.
$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)
If you opted to deploy to adeployment slot, you can add the following step to perform a slot swap. Deployment slots are not yet available for the Flex Consumption SKU.

Deploy a container
You can automatically deploy your code to Azure Functions as a custom container after every successful build. To learn more about containers, seeWorking with containers and Azure Functions.
Deploy with the Azure Function App for Container task
The simplest way to deploy to a container is to use theAzure Function App on Container Deploy task.
To deploy, add the following snippet at the end of your YAML file:
trigger:
- main

variables:
  # Container registry service connection established during pipeline creation
  dockerRegistryServiceConnection: <DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_CONNECTION>
  imageRepository: <IMAGE_REPOSITORY_NAME>
  containerRegistry: <AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME>
  dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'

  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'

- task: AzureFunctionAppContainer@1 # Add this at the end of your file
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<AZURE_SERVICE_CONNECTION>'
    appName: '<APP_NAME>'
    imageName: $(containerRegistry)/$(imageRepository):$(tag)
trigger:
- main

variables:
  # Container registry service connection established during pipeline creation
  dockerRegistryServiceConnection: <DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_CONNECTION>
  imageRepository: <IMAGE_REPOSITORY_NAME>
  containerRegistry: <AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME>
  dockerfilePath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile'
  tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'

  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'

- task: AzureFunctionAppContainer@1 # Add this at the end of your file
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<AZURE_SERVICE_CONNECTION>'
    appName: '<APP_NAME>'
    imageName: $(containerRegistry)/$(imageRepository):$(tag)
The snippet pushes the Docker image to your Azure Container Registry. TheAzure Function App on Container Deploytask pulls the appropriate Docker image corresponding to theBuildIdfrom the repository specified, and then deploys the image.

Create a pipeline with Azure CLI
To create a build pipeline in Azure, use theaz functionapp devops-pipeline createcommand. The build pipeline is created to build and release any code changes that are made in your repo. The command generates a new YAML file that defines the build and release pipeline and then commits it to your repo. The prerequisites for this command depend on the location of your code.
az functionapp devops-pipeline create
