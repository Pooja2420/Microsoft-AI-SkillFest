In this quickstart, you'll enable Microsoft Sentinel and install a solution from the content hub. Then, you'll set up a data connector to start ingesting data into Microsoft Sentinel.
Microsoft Sentinel comes with many data connectors for Microsoft products such as the Microsoft Defender XDR service-to-service connector. You can also enable built-in connectors for non-Microsoft products such as Syslog or Common Event Format (CEF). For this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Activity data connector that's available in the Azure Activity solution for Microsoft Sentinel.
To onboard to Microsoft Sentinel by using the API, see the latest supported version ofSentinel Onboarding States.

Enable Microsoft Sentinel
To get started, add Microsoft Sentinel to an existing workspace or create a new one.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Search for and selectMicrosoft Sentinel.
Search for and selectMicrosoft Sentinel.

SelectCreate.
SelectCreate.
Select the workspace you want to use or create a new one. You can run Microsoft Sentinel on more than one workspace, but the data is isolated to a single workspace.The default workspaces created by Microsoft Defender for Cloud aren't shown in the list. You can't install Microsoft Sentinel on these workspaces.Once deployed on a workspace, Microsoft Sentineldoesn't supportmoving that workspace to another resource group or subscription.

Tip
We recommend onboarding your workspace to the Defender portal for a unified experience in managing security operations (SecOps) across both Microsoft Sentinel and other Microsoft security services.
If you decide to onboard your workspace now, you can continue the procedures in this article from the Defender portal. For more information, seeOnboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal.
Install a solution from the content hub
The content hub in Microsoft Sentinel is the centralized location to discover and manage out-of-the-box content including data connectors. For this quickstart, install the solution for Azure Activity.
In Microsoft Sentinel, selectContent hub.
In Microsoft Sentinel, selectContent hub.
Find and select theAzure Activitysolution.Azure portalDefender portal
Find and select theAzure Activitysolution.

On the solution details pane on the side, selectInstall.
Set up the data connector
Microsoft Sentinel ingests data from services and apps by connecting to the service and forwarding the events and logs to Microsoft Sentinel. For this quickstart, install the data connector to forward data for Azure Activity to Microsoft Sentinel.
In Microsoft Sentinel, selectConfiguration>Data connectorsand search for and select theAzure Activitydata connector.
In Microsoft Sentinel, selectConfiguration>Data connectorsand search for and select theAzure Activitydata connector.

Generate activity data
Let's generate some activity data by enabling a rule that was included in the Azure Activity solution for Microsoft Sentinel. This step also shows you how to manage content in the content hub.
In Microsoft Sentinel, selectContent huband search for and selectSuspicious Resource deploymentrule template in theAzure Activitysolution.

Next steps
In this quickstart, you enabled Microsoft Sentinel and installed a solution from the content hub. Then, you set up a data connector to start ingesting data into Microsoft Sentinel. You also verified that data is being ingested by viewing the data in the workspace.
To visualize the data you've collected by using the dashboards and workbooks, seeVisualize collected data.
