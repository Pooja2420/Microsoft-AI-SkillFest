Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) is the cloud-based protection technology used byAzure Information Protection.
Azure RMS helps toprotectfiles and emails across multiple devices, including phones, tablets, and PCs by using encryption, identity, and authorization policies.
For example, when employees email a document to a partner company, or save a document to their cloud drive, Azure RMS's persistent protection helps secure the data.
Protection settings remain with your data, even when it leaves your organization's boundaries, keeping your content protected both within and outside your organization.

Azure RMS may be legally requiredfor compliance, legal discovery requirements, or best practices for information management.

Azure RMS ensures that authorized people and services, such as search and indexing, can continue to read and inspect the protected data.
Ensuring ongoing access for authorized people and services, also known as "reasoning over data", is a crucial element in maintaining control of your organization's data. This capability may not be easily accomplished with other information protection solutions that use peer-to-peer encryption.

Tip
Attaching protected files, rather than protecting an entire email message, enables you to keep the email text un-encrypted.
For example, you may want to include instructions for first-time use if the email is being sent outside your organization. If you attach a protected file, the basic instructions can be read by anyone, but only authorized users will be able to open the document, even if the email or document is forwarded to other people.
Platform support features
Azure RMS supports a broad range of platforms and applications, including:
Infrastructure features
Azure RMS provides the following features to support IT departments and infrastructure organizations:
Create simple and flexible policies
Easy activation
Auditing and monitoring services
Ability to scale across your organization
Maintain IT control over data
Note
Organizations always have the choice to stop using the Azure Rights Management service without losing access to content that was previously protected by Azure Rights Management.
For more information, seeDecommissioning and deactivating Azure Rights Management.
Customized protection templates provide a quick and easy solution for administrators to apply policies, and for users to apply the correct level of protection for each document and restrict access to people inside your organization.
For example, for a company-wide strategy paper to be shared with all employees, apply a read-only policy to all internal employees. For a more sensitive document, such as a financial report, restrict access to executives only.
Configure your labeling policies in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. For more information, see thesensitivity labeling documentation for Microsoft 365.
For new subscriptions, activation is automatic. For existing subscriptions,activating the Rights Management servicerequires just a couple of clicks in your management portal, or two PowerShell commands.
Audit and monitor usageof your protected files, even after these files leave your organizationâs boundaries.
For example, if a Contoso, Ltd employee works on a joint project with three people from Fabrikam, Inc, they might send their Fabrikam partners a document that's protected and restricted toread-only.
Azure RMS auditing can provide the following information:
Whether the Fabrikam partners opened the document, and when.
Whether the Fabrikam partners opened the document, and when.
Whether other people, who were not specified, attempted, and failed to open the document. This might happen if the email was forwarded on, or saved to a shared location.

AIP administrators cantrack document usage and revoke accessfor Office files. Users canrevoke accessfor their protected documents as needed.
Because Azure Rights Management runs as a cloud service with the Azure elasticity to scale up and out, you donât have to provision or deploy additional on-premises servers.
Organizations can benefit from IT control features, such as:
Security, compliance, and regulatory requirements
Azure Rights Management supports the following security, compliance, and regulatory requirements:
Use of industry-standard cryptography and supports FIPS 140-2.For more information, see theCryptographic controls used by Azure RMS: Algorithms and key lengthsinformation.
