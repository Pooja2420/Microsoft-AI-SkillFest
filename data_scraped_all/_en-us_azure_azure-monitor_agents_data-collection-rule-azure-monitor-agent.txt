Collect data from virtual machine client with Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor automatically collects host metrics and activity logs from your Azure and Arc-enabled virtual machines. To collect metrics and logs from the client operating system and its workloads though, you need to createdata collection rules (DCRs)that specify what you want to collect and where to send it. This article describes how to use the Azure portal to create a DCR to collect different types of common data from VM clients.
Note
If you have basic data collection requirements, you should be able to meet all your requirements using the guidance in this article and the related articles on eachdata source. You can use the Azure portal to create and edit the DCR, and theAzure Monitor agentis automatically installed on each VM that doesn't already have it.
If you want to take advantage of more advanced features liketransformationsor create and assign DCRs using other methods such as Azure CLI or Azure Policy, then seeInstall and manage the Azure Monitor AgentandCreate DCRs in Azure Monitor. You can also view sample DCRs created by this process atData collection rule (DCR) samples for VM  in Azure Monitor.
Prerequisites
Log Analytics workspacewhere you have at leastcontributor rightsto collect the data you configure. SeeCreate a Log Analytics workspaceif you don't already have a workspace you can use.
Permissions to create DCR objectsin the workspace.
To send data across tenants, you must first enableAzure Lighthouse.
See the detailed article for eachdata sourcefor any additional prerequisites.
Create a data collection rule
In the Azure portal, on theMonitormenu, selectData Collection Rules>Createto open the DCR creation pane.

TheBasicstab includes basic information about the DCR.

1This option sets thekindattribute in the DCR. You can set other values for this attribute, but the values aren't available to select in the portal.
kind
Add resources
On theResourcespane, selectAdd resourcesto add VMs that will use the DCR. You don't need to add any VMs yet since you can update the DCR after creation and add/remove any resources. If you selectEnable Data Collection Endpointson theResourcestab, you can select a DCE for each VM. This is only required if you're usingAzure Monitor Private Links. Otherwise, don't select this option.
Note
You can't add a virtual machine scale set (VMSS) with flexible orchestration as a resource for a DCR. Instead, add each VM included in the VMSS.

Important
When resources are added to a DCR, the default option in the Azure portal is to enable a system-assigned managed identity for the resources. For existing applications, if a user-assigned managed identity is already set, if you don't specify the user-assigned identity when you add the resource to a DCR by using the portal, the machine defaults to using asystem-assigned identitythat's applied by the DCR.
Add data sources
On theCollect and deliverpane, clickAdd data sourceto add and configure data sources and destinations for the DCR. You can choose to add multiple data sources to the same DCR or create multiple DCRs with different data sources. A DCR can have up to 10 data sources, and a VM can use any number of DCRs.

The following table lists the types of data you can collect from a VM client with Azure Monitor and where you can send that data. See the linked article for each to learn how to configure that data source.
Verify operation
It can take up to 5 minutes for data to be sent to the destinations after you create a DCR. You can verify that the agent is operational and that data is being collected by querying the data in the Log Analytics workspace.
Verify agent operation
Verify that the agent is operational and communicating properly with Azure Monitor by checking theHeartbeatfor the VM. When an agent is properly communicating with Azure Monitor, it sends a record to the Heartbeat table every minute.
From the virtual machine in the Azure portal, selectLogsand then click theTablesbutton. Under theVirtual machinescategory, clickRunnext toHeartbeat. If the agent is communicating correctly, you should see heartbeat records for the VM.

Verify that records are received
Once you verify that the agent is communicating properly, make sure that the data you expect is being collected. Use the same process as above to view the data in the table for the data source that you configured. The following table lists the category and table for each data source.
Duplicate data warning
Be careful of the following scenarios which may result in collecting duplicate data which will increase your billing charges:
Creating multiple DCRs that have the same data source and associating them to the same VM. If you do have DCRs with the same data source, make sure that you configure them to filter for unique data.
Creating a DCR that collects security logs and enablingMicrosoft Sentinelfor the same VMs. In this case, the same events will be sent to both theEventtable (Azure Monitor) and in theSecurityEventtable (Microsoft Sentinel).
Creating a DCR for a VM that's also running the legacyLog Analytics agenton the same machine. Both may be collecting identical data and storing it in the same table. Follow the guidance atMigrate to Azure Monitor Agent from Log Analytics agentto migrate from the legacy agent.
SeeManage data collection rule associations in Azure Monitorto list the DCRs associated with a VM in the Azure portal. You can also use the following PowerShell command to list all DCRs for a VM:
Get-AzDataCollectionRuleAssociation -resourceUri <vm-resource-id>
Get-AzDataCollectionRuleAssociation -resourceUri <vm-resource-id>
