When you design an application, both functional and non-functional application requirements are critical. This design area describes architecture patterns and scaling strategies that can help make your application resilient to failures.
Important
This article is part of theAzure Well-Architected Framework mission-critical workloadseries. If you aren't familiar with this series, we recommend that you start withWhat is a mission-critical workload?.
Scale-unit architecture
All functional aspects of a solution must be capable of scaling to meet changes in demand, ideallyautoscalingin response to load.
We recommend that you use a scale-unit architecture to optimize end-to-end scalability through compartmentalization, and also to standardize the process of adding and removing capacity. Ascale unitis a logical unit or function that can be scaled independently. A unit can be made up of code components, application hosting platforms, thedeployment stampsthat cover the related components, and even subscriptions to support multi-tenant requirements.
We recommend this approach because it addresses the scale limits of individual resources and the entire application. It helps with complex deployment and update scenarios because a scale unit can be deployed as one unit. Also, you can test and validate specific versions of components in a unit before directing user traffic to it.
Suppose your mission-critical application is an online product catalog. It has a user flow for processing product comments and ratings. The flow uses APIs to retrieve and post comments and ratings, and supporting components like an OAuth endpoint, datastore, and message queues. The stateless API endpoints represent granular functional units that must adapt to changes on demand. The underlying application platform must also be able to scale accordingly. To avoid performance bottlenecks, the downstream components and dependencies must also scale to an appropriate degree. They can either scale independently, as separate scale units, or together, as part of a single logical unit.
Example scale units
The following image shows the possible scopes for scale units. The scopes range from microservice pods to cluster nodes and regional deployment stamps.

Design considerations
Scope. The scope of a scale unit, the relationship between scale units, and their components should be defined according to a capacity model. Take into consideration non-functional requirements for performance.

Scale limits.Azure subscription scale limits and quotasmight have a bearing on application design, technology choices, and the definition of scale units. Scale units can help you bypass the scale limits of a service. For example, if an AKS cluster in one unit can have only 1,000 nodes, you can use two units to increase that limit to 2,000 nodes.

Expected load. Use the number of requests for each user flow, the expected peak request rate (requests per second), and daily/weekly/seasonal traffic patterns to inform core scale requirements. Also factor in the expected growth patterns for both traffic and data volume.

Acceptable degraded performance. Determine whether a degraded service with high response times is acceptable under load. When you're modeling required capacity, the required performance of the solution under load is a critical factor.

Non-functional requirements. Technical and business scenarios have distinct considerations for resilience, availability, latency, capacity, and observability. Analyze these requirements in the context of key end-to-end user flows. You'll have relative flexibility in the design, decision making, and technology choices at a user-flow level.

Define a regional deployment stamp to unify the provisioning, management, and operation of regional application resources into a heterogenous but interdependent scale unit. As load increases, extra stamps can be deployed, within the same Azure region or different ones, to horizontally scale the solution.

Use an Azure subscription as the scale unit so that scale limits within a single subscription don't constrain scalability. This approach applies to high-scale application scenarios that have significant traffic volume.

Model required capacity around identified traffic patterns to make sure sufficient capacity is provisioned at peak times to prevent service degradation. Alternatively, optimize capacity during off-peak hours.

Measure the time required to do scale-out and scale-in operations to ensure that the natural variations in traffic don't create an unacceptable level of service degradation. Track the scale operation durations as an operational metric.

Note
When you deploy in an Azure landing zone, ensure that the landing zone subscription is dedicated to the application to provide a clear management boundary and to avoid theNoisy Neighbor antipattern.
Global distribution
It's impossible to avoid failure in any highly distributed environment. This section provides strategies to mitigate many fault scenarios. The application must be able to withstand regional and zonal failures. It must be deployed in an active/active model so that the load is distributed among all regions.
Watch this video to get an overview of how to plan for failures in mission-critical applications and maximize resiliency:
Design considerations
Redundancy. Your application must be deployed to multiple regions. Additionally, within a region, we strongly recommend that you useavailability zonesto allow for fault tolerance at the datacenter level. Availability zones have a latency perimeter of less than 2 milliseconds between availability zones. For workloads that are "chatty" across zones, this latency can introduce a performance penalty for interzone data transfer.

Active/active model. An active/active deployment strategy is recommended because it maximizes availability and provides a higher composite service-level agreement (SLA). However, it can introduce challenges around data synchronization and consistency for many application scenarios. Address the challenges at a data platform level while considering the trade-offs of increased cost and engineering effort.An active/active deployment across multiple cloud providers is a way to potentially mitigate dependency on global resources within a single cloud provider. However, a multicloud active/active deployment strategy introduces a significant amount of complexity around CI/CD. Also, given the differences in resource specifications and capabilities among cloud providers, you'd need specialized deployment stamps for each cloud.

Loosely coupled event-driven architecture
Couplingenables interservice communication via well-defined interfaces. Aloosecoupling allows an application component to operate independently. Amicroservices architecture styleis consistent with mission-critical requirements. It facilitates high availability by preventing cascading failures.
For loose coupling, we strongly recommend that you incorporateevent-driven design. Asynchronous message processing through an intermediary can build resiliency.

In some scenarios, applications can combine loose and tight coupling, depending on business objectives.
Design considerations
Runtime dependencies. Loosely coupled services shouldn't be constrained to use the same compute platform, programming language, runtime, or operating system.

TheMission-Critical Onlinereference implementation uses microservices to process a single business transaction. It applies write operations asynchronously with a message broker and worker. Read operations are synchronous, with the result directly returned to the caller.

Resiliency patterns and error handling in application code
A mission-critical application must be designed to be resilient so that it addresses as many failure scenarios as possible. This resiliency maximizes service availability and reliability. The application should have self-healing capabilities, which you can implement by using design patterns likeRetries with BackoffandCircuit Breaker.
For non-transient failures that you can't fully mitigate in application logic, the health model and operational wrappers need to take corrective action. Application code must incorporate proper instrumentation and logging to inform the health model and facilitate subsequent troubleshooting or root cause analysis as required. You need to implementdistributed tracingto provide the caller with a comprehensive error message that includes a correlation ID when a failure occurs.
Tools likeApplication Insightscan help you query, correlate, and visualize application traces.
Design considerations
Proper configurations. It's not uncommon for transient problems to cause cascading failures. For example, retry without appropriate back-off exacerbates the problem when a service is being throttled. You can space retry delays linearly or increase them exponentially to back off through growing delays.

Programming language selection
It's important to select the right programming languages and frameworks. These decisions are often driven by the skill sets or standardized technologies in the organization. However, it's essential to evaluate the performance, resilience, and overall capabilities of various languages and frameworks.
Design considerations
Development kit capabilities. There are differences in the capabilities that are offered by Azure service SDKs in various languages. These differences might influence your choice of an Azure service or programming language. For example, if Azure Cosmos DB is a feasible option, Go might not be an appropriate development language because there's no first-party SDK.

Feature updates. Consider how often the SDK is updated with new features for the selected language. Commonly used SDKs, like .NET and Java libraries, are updated frequently. Other SDKs or SDKs for other languages might be updated less frequently.
