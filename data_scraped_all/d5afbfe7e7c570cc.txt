NDAA Section 889 overview
Section 889 of the2019 National Defense Authorization Act(NDAA) prohibits US federal government agencies, contractors, and grant and loan recipients from procuring or usingcertain covered telecommunications equipment and servicesas described in the statute. NDAA Section 889 seeks to mitigate privacy and security risks to US government by prohibiting the purchase and use of such equipment. These prohibitions were implemented in two phases:
Section 889(a)(1)(A)prohibits federal agencies from purchasing covered telecommunications equipment and services. It became effective on 13 August 2019. The US Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued two interim rules amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement Section 889(a)(1)(A). For more information, seeinterim rule 1andinterim rule 2.
Section 889(a)(1)(B)prohibits federal agencies from entering into, or extending or renewing, a contract with a company that uses covered telecommunications equipment and services. It became effective on 13 August 2020, and it has much broader scope than the first phase. It's aimed at ensuring that US government doesn't conduct business with companies that use covered telecommunications equipment and services. DoD, GSA, and NASA issued aninterim ruleamending the FAR to implement Section 889(a)(1)(B).
The detailed definition ofcovered telecommunications equipment and servicesis provided in the statute as follows:
