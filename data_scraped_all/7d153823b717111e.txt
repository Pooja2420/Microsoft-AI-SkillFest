This article describes key design considerations and recommendations for network topologies in Microsoft Azure. The following diagram shows a traditional Azure network topology:

Design considerations
Various network topologies can connect multiple landing zone virtual networks. Examples of network topologies include hub-and-spoke, full-mesh, and hybrid topologies. You can also have multiple virtual networks that are connected via multiple Azure ExpressRoute circuits or connections.

Virtual networks can't traverse subscription boundaries. However, you can use virtual network peering, an ExpressRoute circuit, or VPN gateways to achieve connectivity between virtual networks across different subscriptions.

Virtual network peering is the preferred method to connect virtual networks in Azure. You can use virtual network peering to connect virtual networks in the same region, across different Azure regions, and across different Microsoft Entra tenants.

Virtual network peering and global virtual network peering aren't transitive. To enable a transit network, you need user-defined routes (UDRs) and network virtual appliances (NVAs). For more information, seeHub-spoke network topology in Azure.

You can use ExpressRoute circuits to establish connectivity across virtual networks within the same geopolitical region or use the premium add-on for connectivity across geopolitical regions. Keep these points in mind:Network-to-network traffic might experience more latency, because traffic must hairpin at the Microsoft Enterprise edge (MSEE) routers.The ExpressRoute gateway SKU constrains bandwidth.Deploy and manage UDRs if you need to inspect or log UDRs for traffic across virtual networks.

VPN gateways with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are transitive within Azure and on-premises networks, but they don't provide transitive access to networks connected through ExpressRoute by default. If you need transitive access to networks connected through ExpressRoute, considerAzure Route Server.

When you connect multiple ExpressRoute circuits to the same virtual network, use connection weights and BGP techniques to ensure an optimal path for traffic between on-premises networks and Azure. For more information, seeOptimize ExpressRoute routing.

If you use BGP metrics to influence ExpressRoute routing, you need to change the configuration outside of the Azure platform. Your organization or your connectivity provider must configure the on-premises routers accordingly.

A VPN gateway's maximum aggregated throughput is 10 gigabits per second. A VPN gateway supports up to 100 site-to-site or network-to-network tunnels.

If an NVA is part of the architecture, consider Route Server to simplify dynamic routing between your NVA and your virtual network. Use Route Server to exchange routing information directly through BGP between any NVA that supports BGP and the Azure software-defined network (SDN) in the Azure virtual network. You don't need to manually configure or maintain route tables with this approach.

When you have hub-and-spoke networks in multiple Azure regions, and you need to connect a few landing zones across regions, use global virtual network peering. You can directly connect landing zone virtual networks that need to route traffic to each other. Depending on the communicating virtual machine's SKU, global virtual network peering can provide high network throughput. Traffic that goes between directly peered landing zone virtual networks bypasses NVAs within hub virtual networks. Limitations on global virtual network peering apply to the traffic.

When you have hub-and-spoke networks in multiple Azure regions, and you need to connect most landing zones across regions, use hub NVAs to connect hub virtual networks in each region to each other and to route traffic across regions. You can also use this approach if you can't use direct peering to bypass hub NVAs because of incompatibility with your security requirements. Global virtual network peering or ExpressRoute circuits can help to connect hub virtual networks in the following ways:Global virtual network peering provides a low latency and high throughput connection but generatestraffic fees.If you route through ExpressRoute, you might increase latency due to the MSEE hairpin. The selectedExpressRoute gateway SKUlimits the throughput.

When you need to connect more than two Azure regions, then we recommend that the hub virtual networks in each region connect to the same ExpressRoute circuits. Global virtual network peering requires you to manage a large number of peering relationships and a complex set of UDRs across multiple virtual networks.

When you use ExpressRoute circuits for cross-region connectivity, spokes in different regions communicate directly and bypass the firewall because they learn through BGP routes to the spokes of the remote hub. If you need the firewall NVAs in the hub virtual networks to inspect traffic across spokes, you must implement one of these options:Create more specific route entries in the spoke UDRs for the firewall in the local hub virtual network to redirect traffic across hubs.To simplify route configuration,disable BGP propagationon the spoke route tables.
