Subnet delegation gives explicit permissions to the service to create service-specific resources in the subnet using a unique identifier when deploying the service. This article describes how to add or remove a delegated subnet for an Azure service.

Create a resource group
Create a resource group withNew-AzResourceGroup. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.
New-AzResourceGroup
The following example creates a resource group namedtest-rgin theeastus2location:
$rg = @{
    Name = 'test-rg'
    Location = 'eastus2'
}  
New-AzResourceGroup @rg
$rg = @{
    Name = 'test-rg'
    Location = 'eastus2'
}  
New-AzResourceGroup @rg
Create virtual network
Create a virtual network namedvnet-1with a subnet namedsubnet-1usingNew-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfigin thetest-rgusingNew-AzVirtualNetwork.
New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig
New-AzVirtualNetwork
The IP address space for the virtual network is10.0.0.0/16. The subnet within the virtual network is10.0.0.0/24.
$sub = @{
    Name = 'subnet-1'
    AddressPrefix = '10.0.0.0/24'
}
$subnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

$net = @{
    Name = 'vnet-1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'test-rg'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    AddressPrefix = '10.0.0.0/16'
    Subnet = $subnet
}
New-AzVirtualNetwork @net
$sub = @{
    Name = 'subnet-1'
    AddressPrefix = '10.0.0.0/24'
}
$subnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

$net = @{
    Name = 'vnet-1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'test-rg'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    AddressPrefix = '10.0.0.0/16'
    Subnet = $subnet
}
New-AzVirtualNetwork @net
Create a resource group
Create a resource group withaz group create. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.
az group create
The following example creates a resource group namedtest-rgin theeastu2location:
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2
Create a virtual network
Create a virtual network namedvnet-1with a subnet namedsubnet-1in thetest-rgusingaz network vnet create.
az network vnet create
az network vnet create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --location eastus2 \
    --name vnet-1 \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name subnet-1 \
    --subnet-prefix 10.0.0.0/24
az network vnet create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --location eastus2 \
    --name vnet-1 \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name subnet-1 \
    --subnet-prefix 10.0.0.0/24

Useaz network virtual network subnet updateto update the subnet namedsubnet-1with a delegation to an Azure service. In this exampleMicrosoft.Sql/managedInstancesis used for the example delegation:
az network virtual network subnet update
az network vnet subnet update \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name subnet-1 \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --delegations Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances
az network vnet subnet update \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name subnet-1 \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --delegations Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances
To verify the delegation was applied, useaz network vnet subnet show. Verify the service is delegated to the subnet in the propertyserviceName:
az network vnet subnet show
az network vnet subnet show \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name subnet-1 \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --query delegations
