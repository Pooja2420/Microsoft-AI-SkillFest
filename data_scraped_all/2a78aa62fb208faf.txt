Connected Machine agent network requirements

This topic describes the networking requirements for using the Connected Machine agent to onboard a physical server or virtual machine to Azure Arc-enabled servers.
Tip
For the Azure public cloud, you can reduce the number of required endpoints by using theAzure Arc gateway (preview).
Details
Generally, connectivity requirements include these principles:
All connections are TCP unless otherwise specified.
All HTTP connections use HTTPS and SSL/TLS with officially signed and verifiable certificates.
All connections are outbound unless otherwise specified.
To use a proxy, verify that the agents and the machine performing the onboarding process meet the network requirements in this article.
Azure Arc-enabled server endpoints are required for all server based Arc offerings.
Networking configuration
The Azure Connected Machine agent for Linux and Windows communicates outbound securely to Azure Arc over TCP port 443. By default, the agent uses the default route to the internet to reach Azure services. You can optionallyconfigure the agent to use a proxy serverif your network requires it. Proxy servers don't make the Connected Machine agent more secure because the traffic is already encrypted.
To further secure your network connectivity to Azure Arc, instead of using public networks and proxy servers, you can implement anAzure Arc Private Link Scope.
Note
Azure Arc-enabled servers does not support using aLog Analytics gatewayas a proxy for the Connected Machine agent. At the same time, Azure Monitor Agent supports Log Analytics gateway.
If outbound connectivity is restricted by your firewall or proxy server, make sure the URLs and Service Tags listed below are not blocked.
Service tags
Be sure to allow access to the following Service Tags:
AzureActiveDirectory
AzureTrafficManager
AzureResourceManager
AzureArcInfrastructure
Storage
WindowsAdminCenter (ifusing Windows Admin Center to manage Arc-enabled servers)
For a list of IP addresses for each service tag/region, see the JSON fileAzure IP Ranges and Service Tags â Public Cloud. Microsoft publishes weekly updates containing each Azure Service and the IP ranges it uses. This information in the JSON file is the current point-in-time list of the IP ranges that correspond to each service tag. The IP addresses are subject to change. If IP address ranges are required for your firewall configuration, then theAzureCloudService Tag should be used to allow access to all Azure services. Do not disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs, allow them as you would other Internet traffic.
If you filter traffic to the AzureArcInfrastructure service tag, you must allow traffic to the full service tag range. The ranges advertised for individual regions, for example AzureArcInfrastructure.AustraliaEast, do not include the IP ranges used by global components of the service. The specific IP address resolved for these endpoints may change over time within the documented ranges, so just using a lookup tool to identify the current IP address for a given endpoint and allowing access to that will not be sufficient to ensure reliable access.
For more information, seeVirtual network service tags.
URLs
The table below lists the URLs that must be available in order to install and use the Connected Machine agent.
Azure Cloud
Azure Government
Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet
Note
When configuring the Azure connected machine agent to communicate with Azure through a private link, some endpoints must still be accessed through the internet. ThePrivate link capablecolumn in the following table shows which endpoints can be configured with a private endpoint. If the column showsPublicfor an endpoint, you must still allow access to that endpoint through your organization's firewall and/or proxy server for the agent to function. Network traffic is routed through private endpoint if a private link scope is assigned.

2For details about what information is collected and sent, reviewData collection and reporting for SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc.
For extension versions up to and including February 13, 2024, usesan-af-<region>-prod.azurewebsites.net. Beginning March 12, 2024 both Azure Arc data processing, and Azure Arc data telemetry use*.<region>.arcdataservices.com.
san-af-<region>-prod.azurewebsites.net
*.<region>.arcdataservices.com
Note
To translate the*.servicebus.windows.netwildcard into specific endpoints, use the command\GET https://guestnotificationservice.azure.com/urls/allowlist?api-version=2020-01-01&location=<region>. Within this command, the region must be specified for the<region>placeholder. These endpoints may change periodically.
*.servicebus.windows.net
\GET https://guestnotificationservice.azure.com/urls/allowlist?api-version=2020-01-01&location=<region>
<region>
To get the region segment of a regional endpoint, remove all spaces from the Azure region name. For example,East US 2region, the region name iseastus2.
eastus2
For example:*.<region>.arcdataservices.comshould be*.eastus2.arcdataservices.comin the East US 2 region.
*.<region>.arcdataservices.com
*.eastus2.arcdataservices.com

Transport Layer Security 1.2 protocol
To ensure the security of data in transit to Azure, we strongly encourage you to configure machine to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. Older versions of TLS/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) have been found to be vulnerable and while they still currently work to allow backwards compatibility, they arenot recommended.
The SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc endpoints located at *.<region>.arcdataservices.com only support TLS 1.2 and 1.3. Only Windows Server 2012 R2 and higher have support for TLS 1.2. SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc telemetry endpoint is not supported for Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2.
Subset of endpoints for ESU only
If you're using Azure Arc-enabled servers only for Extended Security Updates for either or both of the following products:
Windows Server 2012
SQL Server 2012
You can enable the following subset of endpoints:
