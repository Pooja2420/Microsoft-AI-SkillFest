Overview of Azure Monitor Agent for Linux Syslog collection and supported RFC standards:
Azure Monitor Agent installs an output configuration for the system Syslog daemon during the installation process. The configuration file specifies the way events flow between the Syslog daemon and Azure Monitor Agent.
Forrsyslog(most Linux distributions), the configuration file is/etc/rsyslog.d/10-azuremonitoragent-omfwd.conf. Forsyslog-ng, the configuration file is/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/azuremonitoragent-tcp.conf.
rsyslog
/etc/rsyslog.d/10-azuremonitoragent-omfwd.conf
syslog-ng
/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/azuremonitoragent-tcp.conf
Azure Monitor Agent listens to a TCP port to receive events fromrsyslog/syslog-ng. The port for this communication is logged at/etc/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/config-cache/syslog.port.NoteBefore Azure Monitor Agent version 1.28, it used a Unix domain socket instead of TCP port to receive events from rsyslog.omfwdoutput module inrsyslogoffers spooling and retry mechanisms for improved reliability.

The Syslog daemon uses queues when Azure Monitor Agent ingestion is delayed or when Azure Monitor Agent isn't reachable.
Azure Monitor Agent ingests Syslog events via the previously mentioned socket and filters them based on facility or severity combination from data collection rule (DCR) configuration in/etc/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/config-cache/configchunks/. Anyfacilityorseveritynot present in the DCR is dropped.

Azure Monitor Agent attempts to parse events in accordance withRFC3164andRFC5424. It also knows how to parse the message formats listed inthis website.
Azure Monitor Agent identifies the destination endpoint for Syslog events from the DCR configuration and attempts to upload the events.NoteAzure Monitor Agent uses local persistency by default. All events received fromrsyslogorsyslog-ngare queued in/var/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/eventsif they fail to be uploaded.

Issues
You might encounter the following issues.
Rsyslog data isn't uploaded because of a full disk space issue on Azure Monitor Agent for Linux
The next sections describe the issue.
Syslog data is not uploading: When you inspect the error logs at/var/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/log/mdsd.err, you see entries aboutError while inserting item to Local persistent storeâ¦No space left on devicesimilar to the following snippet:
/var/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/log/mdsd.err
2021-11-23T18:15:10.9712760Z: Error while inserting item to Local persistent store syslog.error: IO error: No space left on device: While appending to file: /var/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/events/syslog.error/000555.log: No space left on device

Azure Monitor Agent for Linux buffers events to/var/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/eventsprior to ingestion. On a default Azure Monitor Agent for Linux installation, this directory takes ~650 MB of disk space at idle. The size on disk increases when it's under sustained logging load. It gets cleaned up about every 60 seconds and reduces back to ~650 MB when the load returns to idle.
/var/opt/microsoft/azuremonitoragent/events
Thedfcommand shows almost no space available on/dev/sda1, as shown in the following output. Note that you should examine the line item that correlates to the log directory (for example,/var/logor/varor/).

You can use theducommand to inspect the disk to determine which files are causing the disk to be full. For example:
du
cd /var/log
   du -h syslog*
cd /var/log
   du -h syslog*
6.7G    syslog
18G     syslog.1
6.7G    syslog
18G     syslog.1
In some cases,dumight not report any large files or directories. It might be possible that afile marked as (deleted) is taking up the space. This issue can happen when some other process has attempted to delete a file, but a process with the file is still open. You can use thelsofcommand to check for such files. In the following example, we see that/var/log/syslogis marked as deleted but it takes up 3.6 GB of disk space. It hasn't been deleted because a process with PID 1484 still has the file open.
du
lsof
/var/log/syslog

rsyslogd 1484 syslog   14w   REG    8,1 3601566564     0 35280 /var/log/syslog (deleted)
Rsyslog default configuration logs all facilities to /var/log/
On some popular distros (for example, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS), rsyslog ships with a default configuration file (/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf), which logs events from nearly all facilities to disk at/var/log/syslog. RedHat/CentOS family Syslog events are stored under/var/log/but in a different file:/var/log/messages.
/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/
/var/log/messages
Azure Monitor Agent doesn't rely on Syslog events being logged to/var/log/. Instead, it configures the rsyslog service to forward events over a TCP port directly to theazuremonitoragentservice process (mdsd).
/var/log/
azuremonitoragent
If you're sending a high log volume through rsyslog and your system is set up to log events for these facilities, consider modifying the default rsyslog config to avoid logging and storing them under/var/log/. The events for this facility would still be forwarded to Azure Monitor Agent because rsyslog uses a different configuration for forwarding placed in/etc/rsyslog.d/10-azuremonitoragent-omfwd.conf.
/var/log/
/etc/rsyslog.d/10-azuremonitoragent-omfwd.conf
For example, to removelocal4events from being logged at/var/log/syslogor/var/log/messages, change this line in/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conffrom this snippet:*.*;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslogTo this snippet (addlocal4.none;):*.*;local4.none;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog
For example, to removelocal4events from being logged at/var/log/syslogor/var/log/messages, change this line in/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conffrom this snippet:
local4
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/messages

*.*;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog

To this snippet (addlocal4.none;):
local4.none;
*.*;local4.none;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog
*.*;local4.none;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog
