This article provides a detailed description of the available configuration options when deploying your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) by using the Azure portal. For a quick guide, see theSQL Server VM quickstartinstead.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. Create afree accountto get started.
Choose Marketplace image
Use the Azure Marketplace to choose one of several pre-configured images from the virtual machine gallery.
The Developer edition is used in this article because it is a full-featured, free edition of SQL Server for development testing. You pay only for the cost of running the VM. However, you are free to choose any of the images to use in this walkthrough. For a description of available images, see theSQL Server Windows Virtual Machines overview.
Licensing costs for SQL Server are incorporated into the per-second pricing of the VM you create and varies by edition and cores. However, SQL Server Developer edition is free for development and testing, not production. Also, SQL Express is free for lightweight workloads (less than 1 GB of memory, less than 10 GB of storage). You can also bring-your-own-license (BYOL) and pay only for the VM. Those image names are prefixed with {BYOL}. For more information on these options, seePricing guidance for SQL Server Azure VMs.
To choose an image, follow these steps:
SelectAzure SQLin the left-hand menu of the Azure portal. IfAzure SQLis not in the list, selectAll services, then typeAzure SQLin the search box. You can select the star next toAzure SQLto save it as a favorite to pin it to the left-hand navigation.

SelectCreate.
SelectCreate.
Note
SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 are out of extended support and no longer available from the Azure Marketplace.
Basic settings
TheBasicstab allows you to select the subscription, resource group, and instance details.
Using a new resource group is helpful if you are just testing or learning about SQL Server deployments in Azure. After you finish with your test, delete the resource group to automatically delete the VM and all resources associated with that resource group. For more information about resource groups, seeAzure Resource Manager Overview.
On theBasicstab, provide the following information:
UnderProject Details, make sure the correct subscription is selected.
In theResource groupsection, either select an existing resource group from the list or chooseCreate newto create a new resource group. A resource group is a collection of related resources in Azure (virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, etc.).

You also have the option to enable theAzure Hybrid Benefitto use your own SQL Server license and save on licensing cost.
Disks
On theDiskstab, configure your disk options.
UnderOS disk type, select the type of disk you want for your OS from the dropdown list. Premium is recommended for production systems but is not available for a Basic VM. To use a Premium SSD, change the virtual machine size.
UnderAdvanced, selectYesunder useManaged Disks.
Microsoft recommends Managed Disks for SQL Server. Managed Disks handles storage behind the scenes. In addition, when virtual machines with Managed Disks are in the same availability set, Azure distributes the storage resources to provide appropriate redundancy. For more information, seeAzure Managed Disks Overview. For specifics about managed disks in an availability set, seeUse managed disks for VMs in availability set.
Networking
On theNetworkingtab, configure your networking options.
Create a newvirtual networkor use an existing virtual network for your SQL Server VM. Designate aSubnetas well.

Management
On theManagementtab, configure monitoring and auto-shutdown.
Azure enablesBoot diagnosticsby default with the same storage account designated for the VM. On this tab, you can change these settings and enableOS guest diagnostics.
You can also enableSystem assigned managed identityandauto-shutdownon this tab.
SQL Server settings
On theSQL Server settingstab, configure specific settings and optimizations for SQL Server. You can configure the following settings for SQL Server:
Connectivity
Authentication
Azure Key Vault integration
Storage configuration
SQL instance settings
Automated patching
Automated backup
Machine Learning Services
Connectivity
UnderSQL connectivity, specify the type of access you want to the SQL Server instance on this VM. For the purposes of this walkthrough, selectPublic (internet)to allow connections to SQL Server from machines or services on the internet. With this option selected, Azure automatically configures the firewall and the network security group to allow traffic on the port selected.
Tip
By default, SQL Server listens on a well-known port,1433. For increased security, change the port in the previous dialog to listen on a non-default port, such as 1401. If you change the port, you must connect using that port from any client tools, such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

To connect to SQL Server via the internet, you also must enable SQL Server Authentication, which is described in the next section.
If you would prefer to not enable connections to the Database Engine via the internet, choose one of the following options:
Local (inside VM only)to allow connections to SQL Server only from within the VM.
Private (within Virtual Network)to allow connections to SQL Server from machines or services in the same virtual network.
In general, improve security by choosing the most restrictive connectivity that your scenario allows. But all the options are securable through network security group (NSG) rules and SQL/Windows Authentication. You can edit the NSG after the VM is created. For more information, seeSecurity Considerations for SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines.
Authentication
If you require SQL Server Authentication, selectEnableunderSQL Authenticationon theSQL Server settingstab.

Note
If you plan to access SQL Server over the internet (the Public connectivity option), you must enable SQL Authentication here. Public access to the SQL Server requires SQL Authentication.
If you enable SQL Server Authentication, specify aLogin nameandPassword. This login name is configured as a SQL Server Authentication login and a member of thesysadminfixed server role. For more information about Authentication Modes, seeChoose an Authentication Mode.
If you prefer not to enable SQL Server Authentication, you can use the local Administrator account on the VM to connect to the SQL Server instance.
Azure Key Vault integration
To store security secrets in Azure for encryption, selectSQL Server settings, and scroll down toAzure key vault integration. SelectEnableand fill in the requested information.

The following table lists the parameters required to configure Azure Key Vault (AKV) Integration.

For more information, seeConfigure Azure Key Vault Integration for SQL Server on Azure VMs.
Storage configuration
On theSQL Server settingstab, underStorage configuration, selectChange configurationto open theConfigure storagepage and specify storage requirements. You can choose to leave the values at default, or you can manually change the storage topology to suit your IOPS needs. For more information, seestorage configuration.

UnderData storage, choose the location for your data drive, the disk type, and the number of disks. You can also select the checkbox to store your system databases on your data drive instead of the local C:\ drive.

UnderLog storage, you can choose to use the same drive as the data drive for your transaction log files, or you can choose to use a separate drive from the dropdown list. You can also choose the name of the drive, the disk type, and the number of disks.

Configure yourtempdbdatabase settings underTempDb storage, such as the location of the database files, as well as the number of files, initial size, and autogrowth size in MB.
tempdb
Currently, during deployment, the max number oftempdbfiles is 8, but more files can be added after the SQL Server VM is deployed.
tempdb
If you configure the SQL Server instancetempdbon the D: local SSD volume as recommended, the SQL IaaS Agent extension will manage the folder and permissions needed upon re-provisioning.
tempdb

SelectOKto save your storage configuration settings.
SQL instance settings
SelectChange SQL instance settingsto modify SQL Server configuration options, such as the server collation, max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP), SQL Server min and max memory limits, and whether you want to enable theoptimize for ad hoc workloadsoption.

SQL Server license
If you're a Software Assurance customer, you can use theAzure Hybrid Benefitto bring your own SQL Server license and save on resources. SelectYesto enable the Azure Hybrid Benefit, and then confirm that you have Software Assurance by selecting the checkbox.

If you chose a free license image, such as the developer edition, theSQL Server licenseoption is grayed out.
Automated patching
Automated patchingis enabled by default.Automated Patchingallows Azure to automatically apply SQL Server and operating system security updates. Specify a day of the week, time, and duration for a maintenance window. Azure performs patching in this maintenance window. The maintenance window schedule uses the VM locale. If you do not want Azure to automatically patch SQL Server and the operating system, selectDisable.

For improved patching management, which also includes Cumulative Updates, try the integratedAzure Update Managerexperience after your SQL Server VM finishes deployment.
Automated backup
Enable automatic database backups for all databases underAutomated backup. Automated backup is disabled by default.
When you enable SQL automated backup, you can configure the following settings:
Retention period for backups (up to 90 days)
Storage account, and storage container, to use for backups
Encryption option and password for backups
Backup system databases
Configure backup schedule
To encrypt the backup, selectEnable. Then specify thePassword. Azure creates a certificate to encrypt the backups and uses the specified password to protect that certificate.
ChooseSelect Storage Containerto specify the container where you want to store your backups.
By default the schedule is set automatically, but you can create your own schedule by selectingManual, which allows you to configure the backup frequency, backup time window, and the log backup frequency in minutes.

For more information, seeAutomated Backup for SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines.
Machine Learning Services
You have the option to enableMachine Learning Services. This option lets you use machine learning with Python and R in SQL Server 2017. SelectEnableon theSQL Server Settingswindow. Enabling this feature from the Azure portal after the SQL Server VM is deployed will trigger a restart of the SQL Server service.
Review + create
On theReview + createtab:
Review the summary.
SelectCreateto create the SQL Server, resource group, and resources specified for this VM.
You can monitor the deployment from the Azure portal. TheNotificationsbutton at the top of the screen shows basic status of the deployment.
Note
An example of time for Azure to deploy a SQL Server VM: A test SQL Server VM provisioned to the East US region with default settings takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. You might experience faster or slower deployment times based on your region and selected settings.
Open the VM with Remote Desktop
Use the following steps to connect to the SQL Server virtual machine withBastion:
After the Azure virtual machine is created and running, selectVirtual machine, and then choose your new VM.

AfterBastionis deployed successfully, choose the authentication type, enter authentication details, and then selectConnect:

You may need to disable the pop-up blocker in your browser to open the Bastion session in a new browser tab.
After you connect to the SQL Server virtual machine, you can launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect with Windows Authentication using your local administrator credentials. If you enabled SQL Server Authentication, you can also connect with SQL Authentication using the SQL login and password you configured during provisioning.
Access to the machine enables you to directly change machine and SQL Server settings based on your requirements. For example, you could configure the firewall settings or change SQL Server configuration settings.
Connect to SQL Server remotely
In this walkthrough, you selectedPublicaccess for the virtual machine andSQL Server Authentication. These settings automatically configured the virtual machine to allow SQL Server connections from any client over the internet (assuming they have the correct SQL login).
The following sections show how to connect over the internet to your SQL Server VM instance.
Configure a DNS Label for the public IP address
To connect to the SQL Server Database Engine from the Internet, consider creating a DNS Label for your public IP address. You can connect by IP address, but the DNS Label creates an A Record that is easier to identify and abstracts the underlying public IP address.
Note
DNS Labels are not required if you plan to only connect to the SQL Server instance within the same Virtual Network or only locally.
To create a DNS Label, first selectVirtual machinesin the portal. Select your SQL Server VM to bring up its properties.
In the virtual machine overview, select yourPublic IP address.
In the virtual machine overview, select yourPublic IP address.

In the properties for your Public IP address, expandConfiguration.

SelectConnect.
SelectConnect.

Note
This example uses the common port 1433. However, this value will need to be modified if a different port (such as 1401) was specified during the deployment of the SQL Server VM.
Known Issues
I am unable to change the SQL Binary files installation path
SQL Server images from Azure Marketplace install the SQL Server binaries to the C drive. It is not currently possible to change this during deployment. The only available workaround is to manually uninstall SQL Server from within the VM, then reinstall SQL Server and choose a different location for the binary files during the installation process.
