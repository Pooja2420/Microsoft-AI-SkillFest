Review your permission assignments
Before you request a change to permission levels, review your permission assignments as described inView permissions for yourself or others.
Verify that your permission assignments are preventing you from accomplishing a task you need to perform.
Request a change to a permission level or role change
To request a change or increase in your permission levels, take the following actions:
Identify the permissions you need and at what level. Permissions are set at the object, project, and project-collection level. Also, permissions are granted through various roles. To identify the level and permission you need, review thePermissions lookup guide.

Refresh or reevaluate your permissions
After your permission levels get changed, you might need to refresh your permissions for Azure DevOps to recognize the updates. This step is recommended when:
Permission or role changes:Your permission level or role was modified.
Security group modifications:You were added to a new or different security group in Azure DevOps, Microsoft Entra ID, or Active Directory.
Getting added to a new security group can alter your inherited permissions.
Refresh your permissions, which prompts Azure DevOps to reevaluate your permission assignments immediately. If you don't refresh, your permission assignments don't update until you sign out, close your browser, and sign back in.
