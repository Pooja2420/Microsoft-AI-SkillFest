Back up files and applications on Azure Stack

You can use Azure Backup to protect (or back up) files and applications on Azure Stack. To back up files and applications, install Microsoft Azure Backup Server as a virtual machine running on Azure Stack. You can protect the files on any Azure Stack server in the same virtual network. Once you've installed Azure Backup Server, add Azure disks to increase the local storage available for short-term backup data. Azure Backup Server uses Azure storage for long-term retention.
Note
Though Azure Backup Server and System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) are similar, DPM isn't supported for use with Azure Stack.
This article doesn't cover installing Azure Backup Server in the Azure Stack environment. To install Azure Backup Server on Azure Stack, see the article,Installing Azure Backup Server.
Back up Files and Folders in Azure Stack VMs to Azure
To configure Azure Backup Server to protect Files in Azure Stack virtual machines, open the Azure Backup Server console. You'll use the console to configure protection groups and to protect the data on your virtual machines.
In the Azure Backup Server console, selectProtectionand in the toolbar, selectNewto open theCreate New Protection Groupwizard.It may take a few seconds for the wizard to open. Once the wizard opens, selectNextto advance to theSelect Protection Group Typescreen.

In theSelect Data Protection Methodscreen, type a name for the protection group. Select the checkbox forI want short-term protection using:andI want online protection. SelectNext.To selectI want online protection, you must first selectI want short-term protection using:Disk. Azure Backup Server doesn't protect to tape, so disk is the only choice for short-term protection.

If you're protecting application workloads, Azure Backup Server creates recovery points per the Synchronization frequency schedule (provided the application supports incremental backups). If the application doesn't support incremental backups, Azure Backup Server runs an express full backup.ForFile recovery points, specify when to create recovery points. SelectModifyto set the times and days of the week when recovery points are created.

In theReview disk allocationscreen, review the storage pool disk space allocated for the protection group.Total Data sizeis the size of the data you want to back up andDisk space to be provisionedon Azure Backup Server is the recommended space for the protection group. Azure Backup Server chooses the ideal backup volume, based on the settings. However, you can edit the backup volume choices in the Disk allocation details. For the workloads, select the preferred storage in the dropdown menu. Your edits change the values for Total Storage and Free Storage in the Available Disk Storage pane. Underprovisioned space is the amount of storage Azure Backup Server suggests you add to the volume, to continue with backups smoothly in the future.

InChoose replica creation method, select how you want to handle the initial full data replication. If you decide to replicate over the network, Azure recommends you choose an off-peak time. For large amounts of data or less than optimal network conditions, consider replicating the data using removable media.

InSpecify online backup schedule, specify when incremental backups to Azure should occur.You can schedule backups to run every day/week/month/year and the time/date at which they should run. Backups can occur up to twice a day. Each time a backup job runs, a data recovery point is created in Azure from the copy of the backed-up data stored on the Azure Backup Server disk.

If you're using Modern Backup Storage (MBS), File Server end-user recovery (EUR) isn't supported. File Server EUR has a dependency on Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), which Modern Backup Storage doesn't use. If EUR is enabled, use the following steps to recover data:
Navigate to the protected files, and right-click the file name and selectProperties.
