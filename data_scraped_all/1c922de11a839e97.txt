Reduce costs with pooled, multi-session resources. With the new Windows 11 and Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session capability, exclusive to Azure Virtual Desktop, or Windows Server, you can greatly reduce the number of virtual machines and operating system overhead while still providing the same resources to your users.

Only manage the image and virtual machines you use for the sessions in your Azure subscription, not the infrastructure. You don't need to personally manage the supporting infrastructure roles, such as a gateway or broker, like you do with Remote Desktop Services.

Connect users:
Once assigned, users can connect to their published Windows desktops and applications using Windows App or the Remote Desktop client. Connect from any device through either a native application on your device or using a web browser with the HTML5 web client.
