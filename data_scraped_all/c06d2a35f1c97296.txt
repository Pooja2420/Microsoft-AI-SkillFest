To get VMs as close as possible, achieving the lowest possible latency, you should deploy them within aproximity placement group.
A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.
Note
Proximity placement groups cannot be used with dedicated hosts.
Intent for proximity placement groups is not supported on Azure portal. Use ARM templates or other client tools like Powershell or CLI to provide intent for proximity placement groups.
If you want to use availability zones together with placement groups, you need to make sure that the VMs in the placement group are also all in the same availability zone.
Accelerated networkingwill only work if the virtual machines are deployed to anavailability setor avirtual machine scale setthat is linked to a proximity placement group. Having only a proximity placement group will disable the hardware acceleration feature which affects network performance.
