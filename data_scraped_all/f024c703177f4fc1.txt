Alertsin Azure Monitor proactively identify issues related to the health and performance of your Azure resources. This article describes how to enable and edit a set of recommended metric alert rules that are predefined for your Kubernetes clusters.
Enable recommended alert rules
Use one of the following methods to enable the recommended alert rules for your cluster. You can enable both Prometheus and platform metric alert rules for the same cluster.
Note
ARM templates are the only supported method to enable recommended alerts on Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.
Azure portal
Azure Resource Manager
Using the Azure portal, the Prometheus rule group will be created in the same region as the cluster.
From theAlertsmenu for your cluster, selectSet up recommendations.
From theAlertsmenu for your cluster, selectSet up recommendations.

The available Prometheus and platform alert rules are displayed with the Prometheus rules organized by pod, cluster, and node level. Toggle a group of Prometheus rules to enable that set of rules. Expand the group to see the individual rules. You can leave the defaults or disable individual rules and edit their name and severity.

Toggle a platform metric rule to enable that rule. You can expand the rule to modify its details such as the name, severity, and threshold.

Either select one or more notification methods to create a new action group, or select an existing action group with the notification details for this set of alert rules.

Using an ARM template, you can specify the region for the Prometheus rule group, but you should create it in the same region as the cluster.
Download the required files for the template you're working with and deploy using the parameters in the tables below. For examples of different methods, seeDeploy the sample templates.

Parameters:
Edit recommended alert rules
Once the rule group has been created, you can't use the same page in the portal to edit the rules. For Prometheus metrics, you must edit the rule group to modify any rules in it, including enabling any rules that weren't already enabled. For platform metrics, you can edit each alert rule.
Azure portal
Azure Resource Manager
From theAlertsmenu for your cluster, selectSet up recommendations. Any rules or rule groups that have already been created will be labeled asAlready created.

Recommended alert rule details
The following tables list the details of each recommended alert rule. Source code for each is available inGitHubalong withtroubleshooting guidesfrom the Prometheus community.
Prometheus community alert rules
Platform metric alert rules
Legacy Container insights metric alerts (preview)
Metric rules in Container insights were retired on May 31, 2024. These rules were in public preview but were retired without reaching general availability since the new recommended metric alerts described in this article are now available.
If you already enabled these legacy alert rules, you should disable them and enable the new experience.
Disable metric alert rules
From theInsightsmenu for your cluster, selectRecommended alerts (preview).
Change the status for each alert rule toDisabled.
Legacy alert mapping
The following table maps each of the legacy Container insights metric alerts to its equivalent recommended Prometheus metric alerts.
