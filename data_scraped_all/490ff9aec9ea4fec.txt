Azure Firewall Premium is a next generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:
TLS inspection- decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
IDPS- A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
URL filtering- extends Azure Firewallâs FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example,www.contoso.com/a/cinstead ofwww.contoso.com.
www.contoso.com/a/c
www.contoso.com
Web categories- administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.
