Returns
A copy of the input table sorted in either ascending or descending order based on the provided column.
Using special floating-point values
When the input table contains the special valuesnull,NaN,-infand+inf, the order will be as follows:
null
NaN
-inf
+inf
null
NaN
-inf
-5
0
5
+inf
null
NaN
+inf
5
0
-5
-inf
-5
0
+inf
NaN
null
+inf
5
0
-5
NaN
null
Note
Null and NaN values are always grouped together.
The order between null and NaN values is determined by the first and last property because nulls and NaNs don't have an ascending and descending order.
