Azure Private endpoint is the fundamental building block for Private Link in Azure. It enables Azure resources, like virtual machines (VMs), to privately and securely communicate with Private Link resources such as Azure SQL server.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network and bastion host.
Create a virtual machine.
Create an Azure SQL server and private endpoint.
Test connectivity to the SQL server private endpoint.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create a virtual network and an Azure Bastion host
The following procedure creates a virtual network with a resource subnet, an Azure Bastion subnet, and a Bastion host:

In theAzure Bastionsection, selectEnable Azure Bastion.Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses. The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Bastion?.NoteHourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it.

Note
Virtual machines in a virtual network with a bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in bastion hosted virtual networks. For more information, seeDissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM.
Note
Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the backend pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.
The default outbound access IP is disabled when one of the following events happens:
A public IP address is assigned to the VM.
The VM is placed in the backend pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules.
AnAzure NAT Gatewayresource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.
VMs that you create by using virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.
For more information about outbound connections in Azure, seeDefault outbound access in AzureandUse Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections.
Create an Azure SQL server and private endpoint
In this section, you create a SQL server in Azure.

Important
When adding a Private endpoint connection, public routing to your Azure SQL server isn't blocked by default. The setting "Deny public network access" under the "Firewall and virtual networks" blade is left unchecked by default. To disable public network access, ensure this is checked.
Disable public access to Azure SQL logical server
For this scenario, assume you would like to disable all public access to your Azure SQL server, and only allow connections from your virtual network.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterSQL server. SelectSQL serversin the search results.
