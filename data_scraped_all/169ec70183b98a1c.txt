In this Quickstart, you will create a Synapse workspace, and you can follow along with the rest of the tutorials to create a dedicated SQL pool, and a serverless Apache Spark pool.
Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create aâ¯free accountâ¯before you begin.
To complete this tutorial's steps, you need to have access to a resource group for which you're assigned theOwnerrole. Create the Synapse workspace in this resource group.
Create a Synapse workspace in the Azure portal
Start the process
Open theAzure portal, in the search bar enterSynapsewithout hitting enter.
In the search results, underServices, selectAzure Synapse Analytics.
SelectCreateto create a workspace.
Basics tab > Project Details
Fill in the following fields:
Subscription- Pick any subscription.
Resource group- Use any resource group.
Managed Resource group- Leave this blank.
Basics tab > Workspace details
Fill in the following fields:
Workspace name- Pick any globally unique name. In this tutorial, we'll usemyworkspace.
Region- Pick the region where you have placed your client applications/services (for example, Azure Virtual Machine, Power BI, Azure Analysis Service) and storages that contain data (for example Azure Data Lake storage, Azure Cosmos DB analytical storage).
Note
A workspace that is not co-located with the client applications or storage can be the root cause of many performance issues. If your data or the clients are placed in multiple regions, you can create separate workspaces in different regions co-located with your data and clients.
UnderSelect Data Lake Storage Gen 2:
ByAccount name, selectCreate Newand name the new storage accountcontosolakeor similar as the name must be unique.TipIf you get an error reading"The Azure Synapse resource provider (Microsoft.Synapse) needs to be registered with the selected subscription", open the Azure portal and selectSubscriptions. Select your subscription. Under theSettingslist selectResource providers. Search forMicrosoft.Synapse, select it, and selectRegister.

Select your subscription. Under theSettingslist selectResource providers. Search forMicrosoft.Synapse, select it, and selectRegister.
ByFile system name, selectCreate Newand name itusers. This will create a storage container calledusers. The workspace will use this storage account as the "primary" storage account to Spark tables and Spark application logs.

Completing the process
SelectReview + create>Create. Your workspace is ready in a few minutes.
Note
To enable workspace features from an existing dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) refer toHow to enable a workspace for your dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW).
Open Synapse Studio
After your Azure Synapse workspace is created, you have two ways to open Synapse Studio:
Open your Synapse workspace in theAzure portal, in theOverviewsection of the Synapse workspace, selectOpenin the Open Synapse Studio box.
Open your Synapse workspace in theAzure portal, in theOverviewsection of the Synapse workspace, selectOpenin the Open Synapse Studio box.
Go to thehttps://web.azuresynapse.netand sign in to your workspace.
Go to thehttps://web.azuresynapse.netand sign in to your workspace.
https://web.azuresynapse.net

Note
To sign into your workspace, there are twoAccount selection methods. One is fromAzure subscription, the other is fromEnter manually. If you have the Synapse Azure role or higher level Azure roles, you can use both methods to log into the workspace. If you don't have the related Azure roles, and you were granted as the Synapse RBAC role,Enter manuallyis the only way to log into the workspace. To learn more about the Synapse RBAC, refer toWhat is Synapse role-based access control (RBAC).
Place sample data into the primary storage account
We're going to use a small 100k row sample dataset of NYC Taxi Cab data for many examples in this getting started guide. We begin by placing it in the primary storage account you created for the workspace.
Download theNYC Taxi - green trip datasetto your computer:Navigate to theoriginal dataset locationfrom the link, choose a specific year and download the Green taxi trip records in Parquet format.Rename the downloaded file toNYCTripSmall.parquet.
Navigate to theoriginal dataset locationfrom the link, choose a specific year and download the Green taxi trip records in Parquet format.
Rename the downloaded file toNYCTripSmall.parquet.
In Synapse Studio, navigate to theDatahub.
SelectLinked.
Under the categoryAzure Data Lake Storage Gen2, you'll see an item with a name likemyworkspace ( Primary - contosolake ).
Select the container namedusers (Primary).
SelectUploadand select theNYCTripSmall.parquetfile you downloaded.
NYCTripSmall.parquet
Once the parquet file is uploaded, it's available through two equivalent URIs:
https://contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/users/NYCTripSmall.parquet
https://contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/users/NYCTripSmall.parquet
abfss://users@contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/NYCTripSmall.parquet
abfss://users@contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/NYCTripSmall.parquet
Tip
In the examples that follow in this tutorial, make sure to replacecontosolakein the UI with the name of the primary storage account that you selected for your workspace.
