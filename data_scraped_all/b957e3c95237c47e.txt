Transfer a subscription to another Microsoft Entra tenant account
A Microsoft Entra tenant is created for you when you sign up for Azure. The tenant represents your account. You use the tenant to manage access to your subscriptions and resources.
When you create a new subscription, it's hosted in your account's Microsoft Entra tenant. If you want to give others access to your subscription or its resources, you need to invite them to join your tenant. Doing so helps you control access to your subscriptions and resources.
When you transfer billing ownership of your subscription to an account in another Microsoft Entra tenant, you can move the subscription to the new account's tenant. If you do so, all users, groups, or service principals that hadAzure role assignmentsto manage subscriptions and its resources lose their access. Only the user in the new account who accepts your transfer request has access to manage the resources. The new owner must manually add these users to the subscription to provide access to the user who lost it. For more information, seeTransfer an Azure subscription to a different Microsoft Entra directory.
Transfer Visual Studio and Partner Network subscriptions
Visual Studio and Microsoft Cloud Partner Program subscriptions have monthly recurring Azure credit associated with them. When you transfer these subscriptions, your credit isn't available in the destination billing account. The subscription uses the credit in the destination billing account. For example, if Bob transfers a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription to Jane's account on September 9 and Jane accepts the transfer. After the transfer is completed, the subscription starts using credit in Jane's account. The credit resets every ninth day of the month.
