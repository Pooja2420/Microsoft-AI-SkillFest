Virtual machines and containers
Azure provides the broadest support for hardened technologies such asAMD SEV-SNP,Intel TDX, andIntel SGX. All technologies meet our definition of confidential computing, helping organizations prevent unauthorized access or modification of code and data while in use.
Confidential VMs using AMD SEV-SNP.DCasv5andECasv5enable lift-and-shift of existing workloads and helps protect data from the cloud operator with VM-level confidentiality.DCasv6 and ECasv6confidential virtual machines based on 4th generation AMD EPYC processors are currently in gated preview and offer enhanced performance.

Confidential VMs with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).NCCadsH100v5confidential VMs come with a GPU help to ensure data security and privacy while boosting AI and machine learning tasks. These CVMs use linked CPU and GPU TEEs toprotect sensitive data in CPU and a GPU to accelerate computations, making it ideal for organizations needing to protect data from the cloud operator and using high-performance computing.

Confidential VM AKS Worker Nodesallows lift-and-shift of containers to AKS clusters using worker nodes based on AMD SEV-SNP hardware and helps protect data from the cloud operator with worker-node level confidentiality with the configuration flexibility of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Confidential Containers on ACIallows lift-and-shift of containers to the serverless Azure Container Instances service running on AMD SEV-SNP hardware. Confidential containers support container-level integrity and attestation viaconfidential computing enforcement (CCE) policiesthat prescribe the components that are allowed to run within the container group, which the container runtime enforces. This helps protect data from the cloud operator and internal threat actors with container-level confidentiality.

Azure Confidential Ledger. ACL is a tamper-proof register for storing sensitive data for record keeping and auditing or for data transparency in multi-party scenarios. It offers Write-Once-Read-Many guarantees, which make data non-erasable and non-modifiable. The service is built on Microsoft Research'sConfidential Consortium Framework.

Azure Integrated HSMis currently in-development. Azure Integrated HSM is a dedicated hardware security module designed to meet FIPS 140-3 Level 3 security standards, providing robust key protection by enabling encryption and signing keys to remain within the HSM without incurring network access latency. It offers enhanced security with locally deployed HSM services, allowing cryptographic keys to remain isolated from software, including both guest and host software, and supports high volumes of cryptographic requests with minimum latency. Azure Integrated HSM will be installed in every new server in Microsoft's datacenters starting next year to increase protection across Azure's hardware fleet.

Azure IoT Edgesupports confidential applications that run within secure enclaves on an Internet of Things (IoT) device. IoT devices are often exposed to tampering and forgery because they're physically accessible by bad actors. Confidential IoT Edge devices add trust and integrity at the edge by protecting the access to data captured by and stored inside the device itself before streaming it to the cloud.
