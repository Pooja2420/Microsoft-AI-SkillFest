Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) monitoring and logging are provided through logging and integration with Azure Monitor and Azure Monitor logs.
Azure Monitor
WAF with Application Gateway log is integrated withAzure Monitor. Azure Monitor allows you to track diagnostic information including WAF alerts and logs. You can configure WAF monitoring within the Application Gateway resource in the portal under theDiagnosticstab or through the Azure Monitor service directly.
Logs and diagnostics
WAF with Application Gateway provides detailed reporting on each threat it detects. Logging is integrated with Azure Diagnostics logs and alerts are recorded in a json format. These logs can be integrated withAzure Monitor logs.
For more information about diagnostics logs, seeApplication Gateway WAF resource logs.  If logging is enabled and a WAF rule is triggered, any matching patterns are logged in plain text to help you analyze and debug the WAF policy behavior. You can use exclusions to fine tune rules and exclude any data that you want to be excluded from the logs. For more information, seeWeb application firewall exclusion lists in Azure Application Gateway.
