Query your APIs with the cloud security explorer
You can use the cloud security explorer to run graph-based queries on the cloud security graph. By utilizing the cloud security explorer, you can proactively identify potential security risks to your APIs.
There are three types of APIs you can query:
API Collections: API collections enable software applications to communicate and exchange data. They are an essential component of modern software applications and microservice architectures. API collections include one or more API endpoints that represent a specific resource or operation provided by an organization. API collections provide functionality for specific types of applications or services. API collections are typically managed and configured by API management/gateway services.

API Endpoints: API endpoints represent a specific URL, function, or resource within an API collection. Each API endpoint provides a specific functionality that developers, applications, or other systems can access.
