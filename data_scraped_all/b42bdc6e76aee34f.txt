In this article
Amanaged identityhelps Azure services connect to each other by making authentication more streamlined and secure. Instead of managing authorization between the services, a managed identity usesMicrosoft Entra IDto provide authentication. This article describes how to use managed identity to connect Azure Cache for Redis caches to Azure Storage accounts.
A managed identity lets you simplify the process of securely connecting to an Azure Storage account for the following Azure Redis scenarios:
Data persistenceto back up the data in your cache.
Import or exportto save snapshots of cache data or import data from a saved file.
Note
Only the Azure Redis data persistence and import-export features use managed identity. These features are available only in Azure Redis Premium tier, so managed identity is available only in Azure Redis Premium tier.
Azure Cache for Redis supports bothsystem-assignedanduser-assignedmanaged identities. Each type of managed identity has advantages, but the functionality is the same in Azure Cache for Redis.
System-assigned identityis specific to the cache resource. If the cache is deleted, the identity is deleted.
User-assigned identityis specific to a user. You can assign this identity to any resource, such as a storage account, that supports managed identity. This assignment remains even if you delete the specific cache resource.
Configuring managed identity for Azure Redis Premium data persistence or import-export features consists of several parts:
Enable the managed identityin the Azure Redis cache.
Configure the Azure Storage accountto use the managed identity.
Configure thedata persistenceorimport-exportfeatures to use the managed identity.
All the parts must be completed correctly before Azure Redis data persistence or import-export can access the storage account. Otherwise, you see errors or no data written.
Scope of availability
Prerequisites
Ability to create and configure a Premium-tier Azure Redis cache and an Azure Storage account in an Azure subscription.
To assign a user-assigned managed identity: Amanaged identity createdin the same Azure subscription as the Azure Redis cache and Storage account.
Enable managed identity
You can enable managed identity for your Azure Redis cache by using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. You can enable managed identity when you create a cache instance, or afterwards.
Enable managed identity in the Azure portal
During cache creation, you can assign only system-assigned managed identity. You can add either system-assigned or a user-assigned identity to an existing cache.
In theAzure portal, choose tocreate an Azure Cache for Redis cache. On theBasicstab, selectPremiumfor theCache SKU, and complete the rest of the required information.

Once the user-assigned identity is added, verify that it appears on theUser assignedtab of theIdentitypage.
Once the user-assigned identity is added, verify that it appears on theUser assignedtab of theIdentitypage.

Enable managed identity using Azure CLI
You can use the Azure CLI for creating a new cache with managed identity by usingaz redis create. You can update an existing cache to use managed identity by usingaz redis identity.
For example, to update a cache to use system-managed identity, use the following Azure CLI command:
az redis identity assign \--mi-system-assigned \--name MyCacheName \--resource-group MyResource Group
az redis identity assign \--mi-system-assigned \--name MyCacheName \--resource-group MyResource Group
Enable managed identity using Azure PowerShell
You can use Azure PowerShell for creating a new cache with managed identity by usingNew-AzRedisCache. You can update an existing cache to use managed identity by usingSet-AzRedisCache.
For example, to update a cache to use system-managed identity, use the following Azure PowerShell command:
Set-AzRedisCache -ResourceGroupName \"MyGroup\" -Name \"MyCache\" -IdentityType "SystemAssigned"
Set-AzRedisCache -ResourceGroupName \"MyGroup\" -Name \"MyCache\" -IdentityType "SystemAssigned"
Configure the storage account to use managed identity
In the Azure portal, create a new storage account or open an existing storage account that you want to connect to your cache instance.

Important
For export to work with a storage account with firewall exceptions, you must:
Add the Azure Redis cache as aStorage Blob Data Contributorthrough system-assigned identity, and
On the storage accountNetworkingpage, selectAllow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account.
If you don't use managed identity and instead authorize a storage account with a key, having firewall exceptions on the storage account breaks the persistence process and the import-export processes.
Use managed identity with data persistence
On the Azure portal page for your Azure Redis Premium cache that has theStorage Blob Data Contributorrole, selectData persistenceunderSettingsin the left navigation menu.

Important
If you see an export or import failure, double check that your storage account has been configured with your cache's system-assigned or user-assigned identity. The identity used defaults to system-assigned identity if enabled. Otherwise, it uses the first listed user-assigned identity.
