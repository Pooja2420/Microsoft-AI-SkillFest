Azure DevOps Services
Universal Packages enable developers to store a wide range of package types beyond traditional formats like NuGet, npm, Python packages, etc.
Using Azure CLI, you can publish Universal Packages directly from the command line. These packages can be as large as 4 TiB, but they must always include a name and version number. This article guides you through publishing Universal Packages to your Azure Artifacts feed.

Publish Universal Packages
To publish a Universal Package to your feed, you need to provide a package name and version number.
The package name must be in lowercase, start and end with a letter or number, and can only include letters, numbers, and non-consecutive dashes-, underscores_, or periods..
Similarly, the package version must also be in lowercase and should not contain build metadata (indicated by a + suffix). Seesemantic versioningfor more details.

Note
Universal Packages containing an exceptionally large number of files (100K+) may fail to publish. In this case, we recommend bundling the files into aZIPorTARarchive to reduce the file count.
