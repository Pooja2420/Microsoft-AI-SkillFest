Demands (for a private pool).
Definitions that reference this definition:pool
Implementations
Remarks
Use demands to make sure that thecapabilitiesyour pipeline needs are present on the agents that run it. Demands are asserted automatically by tasks or manually by you.
Note
Demands and capabilities are designed for use with self-hosted agents so that jobs can be matched with an agent that
meets the requirements of the job. When using Microsoft-hosted agents, you select an image for the agent that
matches the requirements of the job, so although it is possible to add capabilities to a Microsoft-hosted agent, you don't need
to use capabilities with Microsoft-hosted agents.
You can check for the presence of a capability (Exists operation) or you can check for a specific string in a capability (Equals operation). Checking for the existence of a capability (exists) and checking for a specific string in a capability (equals) are the only two supported operations for demands.
Task demands
Some tasks won't run unless one or more demands are met by the agent. For example, theVisual Studio Buildtask demands thatmsbuildandvisualstudioare installed on the agent.
msbuild
visualstudio
Manually entered agent demands
You might need to use self-hosted agents with special capabilities. For example, your pipeline may requireSpecialSoftwareon agents in theDefaultpool. Or, if you have multiple agents with different operating systems in the same pool, you may have a pipeline that requires a Linux agent.
Default
Exists operation
The exists operation checks for the presence of a capability with the specific name. The comparison is not case sensitive.
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: myCustomCapability # exists check for myCustomCapability
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: myCustomCapability # exists check for myCustomCapability
Equals operation
The equals operation checks for the existence of a capability, and if present, checks its value with the specified value. If the capability is not present or the values don't match, the operation evaluates to false. The comparisons are not case sensitive.
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands: Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
Agent variables as system capabilities
Self-hosted agents have the following system capabilities with similar names to agent variables, but they are not variables and don't require variable syntax when checking for exists or equals in a demand.
Agent.Name
Agent.Version
Agent.ComputerName
Agent.HomeDirectory
Agent.OS
Agent.OSArchitecture
Agent.OSVersion (Windows agents only)

demands: string
Specify a demand for a private pool.
demands: string # Specify a demand for a private pool.
demands: string # Specify a demand for a private pool.
demandsstring.
demands
Specify a demand for a private pool.
Examples
To add a single demand to your YAML build pipeline, add thedemands:line to thepoolsection.
demands:
pool
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware # exists check for SpecialSoftware
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware # exists check for SpecialSoftware

demands: string list
Specify a list of demands for a private pool.
demands: [ string ] # Specify a list of demands for a private pool.
demands: [ string ] # Specify a list of demands for a private pool.
List types
Examples
To specify multiple demands, add one per line.
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands:
  - myCustomCapability   # exists check for myCustomCapability
  - Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands:
  - myCustomCapability   # exists check for myCustomCapability
  - Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
