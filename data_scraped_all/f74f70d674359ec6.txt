Sometimes your workflow must connect to an on-premises data source and can use only connectors that provide this access through an on-premises data gateway. To set up this on-premises data gateway, complete the following tasks:
Install the on-premises data gateway on a local computer.
Install the on-premises data gateway on a local computer.
Create an on-premises data gateway resource in Azure for the local data gateway.
Create an on-premises data gateway resource in Azure for the local data gateway.
When you add a trigger or action to your workflow from a connector that requires the data gateway, you can select the data gateway resource to use with your connection.
In Consumption logic app workflows, you can connect to on-premises data sources only by usingconnectors that provide access through the on-premises data gateway.
In Consumption logic app workflows, you can connect to on-premises data sources only by usingconnectors that provide access through the on-premises data gateway.
In Standard logic app workflows, you can directly access on-premises data sources and resources in Azure virtual networks by usingbuilt-in service provider connectors, which don't require the on-premises data gateway. Instead, you provide information that authenticates your identity and authorizes access to your data source. If a built-in service provider connector isn't available for your data source, but a managed connector is available, you have to use the on-premises data gateway.

This guide shows how to create the Azure data gateway resource after youinstall the on-premises gateway on your local computer.
For more information, see the following documentation:
Connectors that can access on-premises data sources
How the gateway works
For information about how to use a gateway with other services, see the following documentation:
Microsoft Power Automate on-premises data gateway
Microsoft Power BI on-premises data gateway
Microsoft Power Apps on-premises data gateway
Azure Analysis Services on-premises data gateway

Supported data sources
In Azure Logic Apps, the on-premises data gateway supportson-premises connectorsfor the following data sources:
Apache Impala
BizTalk Server
File System
HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID
IBM DB2
IBM Informix
IBM MQ
MySQL
Oracle Database
PostgreSQL
SAP
SharePoint Server
SQL Server
Teradata
You can also createcustom connectorsthat connect to data sources over HTTP or HTTPS by using REST or SOAP. Although a gateway itself doesn't incur extra costs, theAzure Logic Apps pricing modelapplies to connectors and other Azure Logic Apps operations.
Limitations
Azure Logic Apps supports read and write operations through the data gateway, but these operations havelimits on their payload size.
Prerequisites
You alreadyinstalled an on-premises data gateway on a local computer. This data gateway installation must exist before you can create a data gateway resource that links to this installation. You can install only one data gateway per local computer.
You alreadyinstalled an on-premises data gateway on a local computer. This data gateway installation must exist before you can create a data gateway resource that links to this installation. You can install only one data gateway per local computer.
You have thesame Azure account and subscriptionthat you used for your gateway installation. This Azure account must belong only to a singleMicrosoft Entra tenant or directory. You have to use the same Azure account and subscription to create your gateway resource in Azure because only the gateway administrator can create the gateway resource in Azure. Service principals currently aren't supported.When you create a data gateway resource in Azure, you select a data gateway installation to link with your gateway resource and only that gateway resource. Each gateway resource can link to only one gateway installation. You can't select a gateway installation that's already associated with another gateway resource.Your logic app resource and gateway resource don't have to exist in the same Azure subscription. In triggers and actions where you use the gateway resource, you can select a different Azure subscription that has a gateway resource, but only if that subscription exists in the same Microsoft Entra tenant or directory as your logic app resource. You also have to have administrator permissions on the gateway, which another administrator can set up for you. For more information, seeData Gateway: Automation using PowerShell - Part 1andPowerShell: Data Gateway - Add-DataGatewayClusterUser.NoteCurrently, you can't share a data gateway resource or installation across multiple subscriptions.

Connect to on-premises data
After you create your gateway resource and associate your Azure subscription with this resource, you can create a connection between your logic app workflow and your on-premises data source by using the gateway.
In the Azure portal, create or open your logic app workflow in the designer.

Add a trigger or action from a connector that supports on-premises connections through the data gateway.NoteIn Consumption logic app workflows, if a connector has amanaged versionand abuilt-in version, use the managed version, which includes the gateway selection capability.
In Standard logic app workflows, built-in connectors that connect to on-premises data sources don't need to use the gateway.

Frequently asked questions
Q: Why doesn't my gateway installation appear when I create my gateway resource in Azure?A: This issue can happen for these reasons:
Your Azure account isn't the same account that you used for the gateway installation on your local computer. Check that you signed in to the Azure portal with the same identity that you used for the gateway installation. Only the gateway administrator can create the gateway resource in Azure. Service principals currently aren't supported.

Check that you signed in to the Azure portal with the same identity that you used for the gateway installation. Only the gateway administrator can create the gateway resource in Azure. Service principals currently aren't supported.
Your Azure account doesn't belong to only a singleMicrosoft Entra tenant or directory. Check that you're using the same Microsoft Entra tenant or directory that you used during gateway installation.
Your Azure account doesn't belong to only a singleMicrosoft Entra tenant or directory. Check that you're using the same Microsoft Entra tenant or directory that you used during gateway installation.
Your gateway resource and gateway installation don't exist in the same region. Make sure that your gateway installation uses the same region where you want to create the gateway resource in Azure. However, your logic app resource's location can differ from your gateway resource location.
Your gateway resource and gateway installation don't exist in the same region. Make sure that your gateway installation uses the same region where you want to create the gateway resource in Azure. However, your logic app resource's location can differ from your gateway resource location.
Your gateway installation is already associated with another gateway resource. Each gateway resource can link to only one gateway installation, which can link to only one Azure account and subscription. So, you can't select a gateway installation that's already associated with another gateway resource. These installations don't appear in theInstallation Namelist.To review your gateway registrations in the Azure portal, find all your Azure resources that have theOn-premises data gatewayresource type acrossallyour Azure subscriptions. To unlink a gateway installation from a different gateway resource, seeDelete gateway resource.

Q: Why did the location for my existing gateway change?A: Gateway resources created before May 3, 2017 were moved to the original locations of the Microsoft Entra tenant for the work or school account that created those gateways. However, these changes shouldn't affect currently running logic apps, which should continue working as usual. With the gateway's general availability in May, gateway resource locations can differ from logic app locations.
