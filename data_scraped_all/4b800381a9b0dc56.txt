Azure Data Box devices are secured with a password to prevent unwanted intrusion. This password is formally known as thedevice unlock keyand is protected by using an encryption key. By default, the encryption key is a Microsoft managed key. For more direct control, you can provide your own managed key.
Using your own customer-managed key only affects how the device unlock key is encrypted. It doesn't affect how data stored on the device is encrypted.
To keep this level of control throughout the order process, use a customer-managed key when you create your order. For more information, seeTutorial: Order Azure Data Box.
This article describes how you can use customer-managed keys with an existing Azure Data Box order via theAzure portal. This article applies to Azure Data Box, Data Box Next-gen, and Data Box Heavy devices.
Requirements
The customer-managed key for a Data Box order must meet the following requirements:
The key must be an RSA key of 2,048 bits or larger.
The key must be created and stored in an Azure Key Vault that hasSoft deleteandDo not purgebehaviors enabled. You can create a key vault and key while creating or updating your order. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Key Vault?.
TheGet,UnwrapKey, andWrapKeypermissions for the key must be enabled in the associated Azure Key Vault. These permissions must remain in place for the lifetime of the order. Modifying these permissions prevents the customer-managed key from being accessible during the Data Copy process.

Troubleshoot errors
If you receive any errors related to your customer-managed key, use the following table to troubleshoot.
If the deletion occurred within the purge-protection duration period, use the steps atRecover a key vault.
If purge protection is disabled or the deletion occurred beyond the purge-protection duration, the customer-managed key can't be recovered.
Revert the key vault back to the old tenant.
SetIdentity = None, and then revert the value toIdentity = SystemAssigned. This action deletes and recreates the identity. EnableGet,WrapKey, andUnwrapKeypermissions for the new identity within the key vault's Access policy.
