This quickstart walks you through the steps to create your first private DNS zone and record using the Azure portal.
A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for a particular domain. Public DNS zones have unique names and are visible on the Internet. However, a private DNS zone name must only be unique within its resource group and the DNS records are not visible on the Internet. To start hosting your private domain in Azure Private DNS, you first need to create a DNS zone for that domain name. Next, the DNS records for your private domain are created inside this DNS zone.
Important
When you create a private DNS zone, Azure stores the zone data as a global resource. This means that the private zone isn't dependent on a single virtual network or region. You can link the same private zone to multiple virtual networks in different regions. If service is interrupted in one virtual network, your private zone is still available. For more information, seeAzure Private DNS zone resiliency.
Virtual private links
To resolve DNS records in a private DNS zone, resources must typically belinkedto the private zone. Linking is accomplished by creating avirtual network linkthat associates the virtual network to the private zone.
When you create a virtual network link, you can (optionally) enable autoregistration of DNS records for devices in the virtual network. If autoregistration is enabled, Azure private DNS updates DNS records whenever a virtual machine inside the linked virtual network is created, changes its IP address, or is deleted. For more information, seeWhat is the autoregistration feature in Azure DNS private zones.
Note
Other methods are available for resolving DNS records in private DNS zones that don't always require a virtual network link. These methods are beyond the scope of this quickstart article. For more information, seeWhat is Azure DNS Private Resolver.
In this article, a virtual machine is used in a single virtual network. The virtual network is linked to your private DNS zone with autoregistration enabled. The setup is summarized in the following figure.

Prerequisites
If you donât have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
If you prefer, you can complete this quickstart usingAzure PowerShellorAzure CLI.
Create a private DNS zone
The following example creates a DNS zone calledprivate.contoso.comin a resource group calledMyResourceGroup.
On the portal search bar, typeprivate dns zonesin the search text box and pressEnter.

Create the virtual network and subnet
From the Azure portal home page, selectCreate a resource>Networking>Virtual network, or search forVirtual networkin the search box and then select+ Create.
On theCreate virtual networkpage, enter the following:
Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
Resource group: Select an existing resource group or create a new one. The resource group doesn't need to be the same as the one used for the private DNS zone. In this example the same resource group is used (MyResourceGroup).
Resource group: Select an existing resource group or create a new one. The resource group doesn't need to be the same as the one used for the private DNS zone. In this example the same resource group is used (MyResourceGroup).
Virtual network name: Enter a name for the new virtual network.MyVNetis used in this example.

SelectSave, selectReview + create, and then selectCreate.
SelectSave, selectReview + create, and then selectCreate.
Link the virtual network
Next, link the private DNS zone to the virtual network by adding a virtual network link.
Search for and selectPrivate DNS zonesand then select your private zone. For example:private.contoso.com.
UnderDNS Management, selectVirtual Network Linksand then select+ Add.
Enter the following parameters:
Link name: Provide a name for the link, for example:MyVNetLink.
Subscription: Select our subscription.
Virtual Network: Select the virtual network that you created, for example:MyVNet.
UnderConfiguration, select the checkbox next toEnable auto registration.

SelectCreate, wait until the virtual link is created, and then verify that it is listed on theVirtual Network Linkspage.
Create the test virtual machine
Now, create a virtual machine to test autoregistgration in your private DNS zone:
On the portal page upper left, selectCreate a resource, and then selectWindows Server 2019 Datacenter.
SelectMyResourceGroupfor the resource group.
TypemyVM01- for the name of the virtual machine.
Select *(US) West USfor theRegion.
Enter a name for the administrator user name.
Enter a password and confirm the password.
ForPublic inbound ports, selectAllow selected ports, and then selectRDP (3389)forSelect inbound ports.
Accept the other defaults for the page and then clickNext: Disks >.
Accept the defaults on theDiskspage, then clickNext: Networking >.
Make sure thatmyAzureVNetis selected for the virtual network.
Accept the other defaults for the page, and then clickNext: Management >.
ForBoot diagnostics, selectDisable, accept the other defaults, and then selectReview + create.
Review the settings and then clickCreate. It will take a few minutes for the virtual machine allocation to complete.
Search for and selectVirtual machinesand then verify that the VM status isRunning. If it isn't running, start the virtual machine.
Review autoregistration
Search for or selectPrivate DNS zonesand then select theprivate.contoso.comzone.
Search for or selectPrivate DNS zonesand then select theprivate.contoso.comzone.
Under DNS Management, select Recordsets.
Under DNS Management, select Recordsets.
Verify that a DNS record exists ofTypeAwith anAuto registeredvalue ofTrue. See the following example:
Verify that a DNS record exists ofTypeAwith anAuto registeredvalue ofTrue. See the following example:

Create another DNS record
You can also add records to the private DNS zone manually. The following example creates a record with the hostnamedbin the DNS Zoneprivate.contoso.com. The fully qualified name of the record set isdb.private.contoso.com. The record type isA, with an IP address corresponding to the autoregistered IP address ofmyVM01.private.contoso.com.
Search for or selectPrivate DNS zonesand then select theprivate.contoso.comzone.
UnderDNS Management, selectRecordsets.
Select+ Add.
UnderName, enterdb.
Next toIP Address, type the IP address you see formyVM01.
SelectOK.
Search and display records
By default, theRecordsetsnode displays all record sets in the zone. A record set is a collection of records that have the same name and are the same type. Record sets are automatically fetched in batches of 100 as you scroll through the list.
You can also search and display specific DNS record sets in the zone by entering a value in the search box. In the following example, one record with the namedbis displayed:

You can search by name, type, TTL, value, or autoregistration status. For example, the recorddbin this example is also displayed by searching forA(display all records of type A),3600(the record's TTL value),10.2.0.5(the IP address of the A record), orFalse(non-autoregistered records). All records in the zone that match the search criteria are displayed in batches of 100.
Test the private zone
Now you can test the name resolution for yourprivate.contoso.comprivate zone.
You can use the ping command to test name resolution. You can do this by connecting to the virtual machine and opening a command prompt, or by using theRun commandon this virtual machine.
To use the Run command:
SelectVirtual machines, select your virtual machine, and then underOperationsselectRun command.
SelectVirtual machines, select your virtual machine, and then underOperationsselectRun command.
SelectRunPowerShellScript, underRun Command Scriptenterping myvm01.private.contoso.comand then selectRun. See the following example:
SelectRunPowerShellScript, underRun Command Scriptenterping myvm01.private.contoso.comand then selectRun. See the following example:
