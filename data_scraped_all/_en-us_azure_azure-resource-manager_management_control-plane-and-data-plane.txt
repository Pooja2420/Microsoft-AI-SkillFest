Azure control plane and data plane

Azure operations can be divided into two categories - control plane and data plane. This article describes the differences between those two types of operations.
You use the control plane to manage resources in your subscription. You use the data plane to use capabilities exposed by your instance of a resource type.
For example:
You create a virtual machine through the control plane. After the virtual machine is created, you interact with it through data plane operations, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

You create a storage account through the control plane. Use the data plane to read and write data in the storage account.

You create an Azure Cosmos DB database through the control plane. To query data in the Azure Cosmos DB database, use the data plane.

Control plane
All requests for control plane operations are sent to the Azure Resource Manager URL. That URL varies by the Azure environment.
For Azure global, the URL ishttps://management.azure.com.
https://management.azure.com
For Azure Government, the URL ishttps://management.usgovcloudapi.net/.
https://management.usgovcloudapi.net/
For Azure Germany, the URL ishttps://management.microsoftazure.de/.
https://management.microsoftazure.de/
For Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet, the URL ishttps://management.chinacloudapi.cn.
https://management.chinacloudapi.cn
To discover which operations use the Azure Resource Manager URL, see theAzure REST API. For example, thecreate or update operationfor MySQL is a control plane operation because the request URL is:
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/{serverName}/databases/{databaseName}?api-version=2017-12-01
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/{serverName}/databases/{databaseName}?api-version=2017-12-01
Azure Resource Manager handles all control plane requests. It automatically applies the Azure features you implemented to manage your resources, such as:
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)
Azure Policy
Management Locks
Activity Logs
After Azure Resource Manager authenticates the request, it sends the request to the resource provider, which completes the operation. Even during periods of unavailability for the control plane, you can still access the data plane of your Azure resources. For instance, you can continue to access and operate on data in your storage account resource via its separate storage URIhttps://myaccount.blob.core.windows.neteven whenhttps://management.azure.comisn't available.
https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net
https://management.azure.com
The control plane includes two scenarios for handling requests - "green field" and "brown field". Green field refers to new resources. Brown field refers to existing resources. As you deploy resources, Azure Resource Manager understands when to create new resources and when to update existing resources. You don't have to worry about creating identical resources.
Data plane
Requests for data plane operations are sent to an endpoint that's specific to your instance. For example, theDetect Language operationin Azure AI services is a data plane operation because the request URL is:
POST {Endpoint}/text/analytics/v2.0/languages
POST {Endpoint}/text/analytics/v2.0/languages
Data plane operations aren't limited to REST API. They might require other credentials, such as logging in to a virtual machine or database server.
Features that enforce management and governance might not apply to data plane operations. You need to consider the different ways users interact with your solutions. For example, a lock that prevents users from deleting a database doesn't prevent users from deleting data through queries.
You can use some policies to govern data plane operations. For more information, seeResource Provider modes (preview) in Azure Policy.
