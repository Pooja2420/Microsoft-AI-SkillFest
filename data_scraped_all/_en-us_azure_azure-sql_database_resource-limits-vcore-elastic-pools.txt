Resource limits for elastic pools using the vCore purchasing model

Applies to:Azure SQL Database
This article provides the detailed resource limits for Azure SQL Database elastic pools and pooled databases using the vCore purchasing model.
For DTU purchasing model limits for single databases on a server, seeOverview of resource limits on a server.
For DTU purchasing model resource limits for Azure SQL Database, seeDTU resource limits single databasesandDTU resource limits elastic pools.
For vCore resource limits, seevCore resource limits - Azure SQL DatabaseandvCore resource limits - elastic pools.
For more information regarding the different purchasing models, seePurchasing models and service tiers.
Important
Shrink operations should not be considered a regular maintenance operation. Data and log files that grow due to regular, recurring business operations do not require shrink operations. Under some circumstances, you might need to shrink a database to reclaim unused space. For more information, seeManage file space in Azure SQL Database.
Each read-only replica of an elastic pool has its own resources, such as vCores, memory, data IOPS,tempdb, workers, and sessions. Each read-only replica is subject to elastic pool resource limits detailed later in this article.
tempdb
You can set the service tier, compute size (service objective), and storage amount using:
Transact-SQLviaALTER DATABASE
Azure portal
PowerShell
Azure CLI
REST API
Important
For scaling guidance and considerations, seeScale an elastic pool.
If all vCores of an elastic pool are busy, then each database in the pool receives an equal amount of compute resources to process queries. Azure SQL Database provides resource sharing fairness between databases by ensuring equal slices of compute time. Elastic pool resource sharing fairness is in addition to any amount of resource otherwise guaranteed to each database when the vCore min per database is set to a non-zero value.
For the same number of vCores, resources provided to an elastic pool can exceed the resources provided to a single database outside of an elastic pool. This means it's possible for the CPU, Data IO, and Log write utilization of an elastic pool to be less than the summation of CPU, Data IO, and Log write utilization across databases within the pool, depending on workload patterns. For example, in an extreme case with only one database in an elastic pool where database Data IO utilization is 100%, it's possible for pool Data IO utilization to be 50% for certain workload patterns. This can happen even if max vCores per database remains at the maximum supported value for the given pool size.
Note
The Gen5 hardware in the vCore purchasing model has been renamed tostandard-series (Gen5).

3The maximum value for IO sizes ranging between 8 KB and 64 KB. Actual IOPS are workload-dependent. For details, seeData IO Governance.
4For the max concurrent workers for any individual database, seeSingle database resource limits. For example, if the elastic pool is using Gen5 and the max vCore per database is set at 2, then the max concurrent workers value is 200. If max vCore per database is set to 0.5, then the max concurrent workers value is 50 since on Gen5 there are a max of 100 concurrent workers per vCore. For other max vCore settings per database that are less 1 vCore or less, the number of max concurrent workers is similarly rescaled.

Hyperscale - provisioned compute - standard-series (Gen5)
Although the published Hyperscale resource limits for standard-series and premium-series are the same, premium-series offers faster CPU performance compared to standard-series, and scales up to 128 vCores, compared to 80 vCores for standard-series. Resources using premium-series are guaranteed to run on hardware with newer CPUs. Standard-series does not provide this guarantee and, depending on availability, resources might be placed on older hardware. There is no price difference between the two, butpremium-series is available in certain regions.

Database properties for pooled databases
For each elastic pool, you can optionally specify per database minimum and maximum vCores to modify resource consumption patterns within the pool. Specified min and max values apply to all databases in the pool. Customizing min and max vCores for individual databases in the pool isn't supported.
You can also set maximum storage per database, for example to prevent a database from consuming all pool storage. This setting can be configured independently for each database.
The following table describes per database properties for pooled databases.

Important
Because resources in an elastic pool are finite, setting min vCores per database to a value greater than 0 implicitly limits resource utilization by each database. If, at a point in time, most databases in a pool are idle, resources reserved to satisfy the min vCores guarantee are not available to databases active at that point in time.
Additionally, setting min vCores per database to a value greater than 0 implicitly limits the number of databases that can be added to the pool. For example, if you set the min vCores to 2 in a 20 vCore pool, it means that you will not be able to add more than 10 databases to the pool, because 2 vCores are reserved for each database.
Even though the per database properties are expressed in vCores, they also govern consumption of other resource types, such as data IO, log IO, buffer pool memory, and worker threads. As you adjust min and max per database vCore values, reservations and limits for all resource types are adjusted proportionally.
Min and max per database vCore values apply to resource consumption by user workloads, but not to resource consumption by internal processes. For example, for a database with a per database max vCores set to half of the pool vCores, user workload can't consume more than one half of the buffer pool memory. However, this database can still take advantage of pages in the buffer pool that were loaded by internal processes. For more information, seeResource consumption by user workloads and internal processes.
Note
The resource limits of individual databases in elastic pools are generally the same as for single databases outside of pools that have the same compute size (service objective). For example, the max concurrent workers for a GP_S_Gen5_10 database is 750 workers. So, the max concurrent workers for a database in a GP_Gen5_10 pool is also 750 workers. Note, the total number of concurrent workers in GP_Gen5_10 pool is 1050. For the max concurrent workers for any individual database, seeSingle database resource limits.
Previously available hardware
This section includes details on previously available hardware.
Gen4 hardware has been retired and isn't available for provisioning, upscaling, or downscaling. Migrate your database to a supported hardware generation for a wider range of vCore and storage scalability, accelerated networking, best IO performance, and minimal latency. For more information, seeSupport has ended for Gen 4 hardware on Azure SQL Database.
