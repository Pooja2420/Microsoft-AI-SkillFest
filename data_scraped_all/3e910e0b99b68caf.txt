This article provides developer guidance for using Computer Vision, Face API, Text Analytics, and Translator Azure AI services. For feature variations and limitations, seeCompare Azure Government and global Azure.
Prerequisites
Note
We recommend that you use the Azure Az PowerShell module to interact with Azure. To get started, seeInstall Azure PowerShell. To learn how to migrate to the Az PowerShell module, seeMigrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az.

Provision Azure AI services accounts
In order to access any of the Azure AI services APIs, you must first provision an Azure AI services account for each of the APIs you want to access. You can create Azure AI services in theAzure Government portal, or you can use Azure PowerShell to access the APIs and services as described in this article.
Note
You must go through the process of creating an account and retrieving account key (explained below)for eachof the APIs you want to access.
Make sure that you have theCognitive Services resource provider registered on your account.You can do this byrunning the following PowerShell command:Get-AzResourceProviderIf you donot seeMicrosoft.CognitiveServices, you have to register the resource provider byrunning the following command:Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices
Make sure that you have theCognitive Services resource provider registered on your account.
You can do this byrunning the following PowerShell command:
Get-AzResourceProvider
Get-AzResourceProvider
If you donot seeMicrosoft.CognitiveServices, you have to register the resource provider byrunning the following command:
Microsoft.CognitiveServices
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices
In the PowerShell command below, replace<rg-name>,<name-of-your-api>, and<location-of-resourcegroup>with your relevant account information.Replace thetype of APItag with any of the following APIs you want to access:ComputerVisionFaceLanguageTextTranslationOpenAINew-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName '<rg-name>' -name '<name-of-your-api>' -Type <type of API> -SkuName S0 -Location '<location-of-resourcegroup>'Example:New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegrouptest' -name 'myFaceAPI' -Type Face -SkuName S0 -Location 'usgovvirginia'After you run the command, you should see something like this:

New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName '<rg-name>' -name '<name-of-your-api>' -Type <type of API> -SkuName S0 -Location '<location-of-resourcegroup>'
New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName '<rg-name>' -name '<name-of-your-api>' -Type <type of API> -SkuName S0 -Location '<location-of-resourcegroup>'
Example:

New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegrouptest' -name 'myFaceAPI' -Type Face -SkuName S0 -Location 'usgovvirginia'
After you run the command, you should see something like this:

Copy and save the "Endpoint" attribute somewhere as you will need it when making calls to the API.

Retrieve account key
You must retrieve an account key to access the specific API.
In the PowerShell command below, replace the<youraccountname>tag with the name that you gave the Account that you created above. Replace therg-nametag with the name of your resource group.
<youraccountname>
rg-name
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountKey -Name <youraccountname> -ResourceGroupName 'rg-name'
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountKey -Name <youraccountname> -ResourceGroupName 'rg-name'
Example:
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountKey -Name myFaceAPI -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegrouptest'
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountKey -Name myFaceAPI -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegrouptest'
Copy and save the first key somewhere as you will need it to make calls to the API.

Now you are ready to make calls to the APIs.
Follow API quickstarts
The quickstarts below will help you to get started with the APIs available through Azure AI services in Azure Government.
Note
The URI for accessing Azure AI Services resources in Azure Government is different than in Azure. For a list of Azure Government endpoints, seeCompare Azure Government and global Azure.

The URI for accessing the API is:https://<your-custom-domain>.cognitiveservices.azure.us/translator/text/v3.0You can find your custom domain endpoint in the overview blade on the Azure Government portal once the resource is created.
There are two regions:US Gov VirginiaandUS Gov Arizona.
