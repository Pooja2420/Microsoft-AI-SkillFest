Azure Key Vault supports storing digital certificates issued by any certificate authority (CA). It supports creating a certificate signing request (CSR) with a private/public key pair. The CSR can be signed by any CA (an internal enterprise CA or an external public CA). A certificate signing request (CSR) is a message that you send to a CA in order to request a digital certificate.
For more general information about certificates, seeAzure Key Vault certificates.

Add certificates in Key Vault issued by partnered CAs
Key Vault partners with the following certificate authorities to simplify certificate creation.
Add certificates in Key Vault issued by non-partnered CAs
Follow these steps to add a certificate from CAs that aren't partnered with Key Vault. (For example, GoDaddy isn't a trusted Key Vault CA.)

PowerShell
Go to the key vault that you want to add the certificate to.

The resulting output forOUisDocs, Contoso.

If you're using a Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) that has a comma (,) in the value, wrap the value that contains the special character in double quotes.
Example entry toSubject:DC=Contoso,OU="Docs,Contoso",CN=www.contosoHRApp.com

Create a certificate policy. Because the CA chosen in this scenario isn't partnered,IssuerNameis set toUnknownand Key Vault doesn't enroll or renew the certificate.$policy = New-AzKeyVaultCertificatePolicy -SubjectName "CN=www.contosoHRApp.com" -ValidityInMonths 1  -IssuerName UnknownNoteIf you're using a Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) that has a comma (,) in the value, use single quotes for the full value or value set, and wrap the value that contains the special character in double quotes.Example entry toSubjectName:$policy = New-AzKeyVaultCertificatePolicy -SubjectName 'OU="Docs,Contoso",DC=Contoso,CN=www.contosoHRApp.com' -ValidityInMonths 1  -IssuerName Unknown. In this example, theOUvalue reads asDocs, Contoso. This format works for all values that contain a comma.In this example, the RDNOUcontains a value with a comma in the name.

Create the CSR.

$csr = Add-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName ContosoKV -Name ContosoManualCSRCertificate -CertificatePolicy $policy
$csr.CertificateSigningRequest
Have the CA sign the CSR. The$csr.CertificateSigningRequestis the base encoded CSR for the certificate. You can dump this blob into the issuerâs certificate request website. This step varies from CA to CA. Look up your CAâs guidelines on how to execute this step. You can also use tools such as certreq or openssl to get the CSR signed and complete the process of generating a certificate.

Merge the signed request in Key Vault. After the certificate request has been signed, you can merge it with the initial private/public key pair created in Azure Key Vault.Import-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName ContosoKV -Name ContosoManualCSRCertificate -FilePath C:\test\OutputCertificateFile.cer

Import-AzKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName ContosoKV -Name ContosoManualCSRCertificate -FilePath C:\test\OutputCertificateFile.cer

Add more information to the CSR
If you want to add more information when creating the CSR, define it inSubjectName. You might want to add information such as:
Country/region
City/locality
State/province
Organization
Organizational unit
Example
SubjectName="CN = learn.microsoft.com, OU = Microsoft Corporation, O = Microsoft Corporation, L = Redmond, S = WA, C = US"
SubjectName="CN = learn.microsoft.com, OU = Microsoft Corporation, O = Microsoft Corporation, L = Redmond, S = WA, C = US"
Note
If you're requesting a Domain Validation (DV) certificate with additional information, the CA might reject the request if it can't validate all the information in the request. The additional information might be more appropriate if you're requesting an Organization Validation (OV) certificate.

What if I seeError type 'The public key of the end-entity certificate in the specified X.509 certificate content does not match the public part of the specified private key. Please check if certificate is valid'?This error occurs if you aren't merging the signed CSR with the same CSR request you initiated. Each new CSR that you create has a private key, which has to match when you merge the signed request.
