Connection monitor (classic) is deprecated and no longer available. For more information, seeMigrate from connection monitor (classic)to migrate your connection monitors from connection monitor (classic) to the new connection monitor.
Connection monitor provides unified and continuous network connectivity monitoring, enabling users to detect anomalies, identify the specific network component responsible for issues, and troubleshoot with actionable insights in Azure and hybrid cloud environments.
Connection monitor tests measure aggregated packet loss and network latency metrics across TCP, ICMP, and HTTP pings. A unified topology visualizes the end-to-end network path, highlighting network path hops with hop performance metrics. Connection monitor provides actionable insights and detailed logs to efficiently analyze and troubleshoot the root cause of an issue.

Use cases
Here are some use cases of Connection monitor:
Your front-end web server virtual machine (VM) communicates with a database server VM in a multi-tier application. You want to check network connectivity between the two VMs.
You want to check the connectivity from single or multiple instances of an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set to your Azure or non-Azure multi-tier application.
You want to check the connectivity between your on-premises setups and the Azure VMs or scale sets that host your cloud application.
You want VMs the East US region to ping VMs in the Central US region to measure and compare cross-region network latencies.
You have on-premises office sites in Seattle, Washington, and Ashburn, Virginia, both connecting to Microsoft 365 URLs. You want to compare the latencies between these locations for your Microsoft 365 users.
Your hybrid application requires connectivity to an Azure storage account endpoint, accessed by both your on-premises site and Azure application. You want to compare the latency of the on-premises site with that of the Azure application.

Monitoring agents
Connection monitor relies on lightweight executable files to run connectivity checks. It supports connectivity checks from both Azure environments and on-premises environments. The executable file that you use depends on whether your VM is hosted on Azure or on-premises.
Note
Monitoring extensions for Azure and non-Azure endpoints are automatically enabled when you use the Azure portal to create a connection monitor.
Monitoring connectivity from Azure virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets
To monitor connectivity from an Azure virtual machine or virtual machine scale set, Connection monitor must recognize these resources as monitoring sources. To achieve this, you need to install the Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension, also known as the Network Watcher extension, on your Azure VMs or scale sets. This extension is required for enabling end-to-end monitoring and accessing other advanced functionalities. For more information, seeManage Network Watcher extension for WindowsorManage Network Watcher extension for Linux.
Monitoring connectivity from on-premises hosts
To monitor connectivity from the on-premises host, it must be enabled with Arc agent. To learn more about enabling the Arc agent, seeConnect hybrid machines with Azure Arc-enabled servers. The agent is supported on both Windows and Linux machines.
Once the Azure Arc agent is enabled, proceed to enable the Azure Monitor Agent. For more information, seeInstall and manage Azure Monitor Agent.
Tip
You can escape the installation process of the Azure Monitor Agent extension if you use the Azure Portal to create your connection monitor. However, you still need to enable the Azure Arc agent on the on-premises host machines.
Note
Currently, Connection monitor only supports Arc-enabled on-premises hosts as source endpoints. Log Analytics agent is no longer supported for monitoring on-premises machines with Connection monitor.
Log Analytics workspace monitoring solution
To ensure monitoring logs are accurately uploaded in the Log Analytics workspace, make sure the Network Performance Monitoring solution is enabled in the workspace before creating a connection monitor:
To enable the Network Performance Monitor solution for on-premises machines, follow these steps:
In the Azure portal, go toNetwork Watcher.

Create a connection monitor
Connection monitor monitors communication at regular intervals. It informs you of changes in reachability and latency. You can also check the current and historical network topology between source agents and destination endpoints.
Sources can be Azure VMs/ scale sets or on-premises machines that have an installed monitoring agent. Destination endpoints can be Microsoft 365 URLs, Dynamics 365 URLs, custom URLs, Azure VM resource IDs, IPv4, IPv6, FQDN, or any domain name.
Access Connection monitor
In the Azure portal, go toNetwork Watcher.

Create a connection monitor
In connection monitors that you create in Connection monitor, you can add both on-premises machines and Azure VMs/ scale sets as sources. These connection monitors can also monitor connectivity to endpoints. The endpoints can be on Azure or any other URL or IP address.
Connection monitor includes the following entities:
Connection monitor resource: A region-specific Azure resource. All the following entities are properties of a connection monitor resource.
Endpoint: A source or destination that participates in connectivity checks. Examples of endpoints include Azure VMs/ scale sets, on-premises agents, URLs, and IP addresses.
Test configuration: A protocol-specific configuration for a test. Based on the protocol you select, you can define the port, thresholds, test frequency, and other properties.
Test group: The group that contains source endpoints, destination endpoints, and test configurations. A connection monitor can contain more than one test group.
Test: The combination of a source endpoint, destination endpoint, and test configuration. A test is the most granular level at which monitoring data is available. The monitoring data includes the percentage of checks that failed and the round-trip time (RTT).

You can create a connection monitor by using theAzure portal,ARMClient, orAzure PowerShell.
All sources, destinations, and test configurations that you add to a test group get broken down into individual tests. Here's an example of how sources and destinations are arranged:
Test group: TG1
Sources: 3 (A, B, C)
Destinations: 2 (D, E)
Test configurations: 2 (Config 1, Config 2)
Total tests created: 12
Scale limits
Connection monitors have the following scale limits:
Maximum connection monitors per subscription per region: 100
Maximum test groups per connection monitor: 20
Maximum sources and destinations per connection monitor: 100
Maximum test configurations per connection monitor: 20
Monitoring coverage for Azure and Non-Azure Resources:
Connection monitor provides five different coverage levels for monitoring compound resources, that is, virtual networks, subnets, and scale sets. The coverage level is defined as the % of instances of a compound resource actually included in monitoring those resources as sources or destinations.
Users can manually select a coverage level from Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and Full to define an approximate % of instances to be included in monitoring the particular resource as an endpoint.
Analyze monitoring data and set alerts
After you create a connection monitor, sources check connectivity to destinations based on your test configuration.
While monitoring endpoints, Connection monitor reevaluates the status of endpoints once every 24 hours. Hence, in case a VM gets deallocated or is turned-off during a 24-hour cycle, Connection monitor would report an indeterminate state due to absence of data in the network path until the end of the 24-hour cycle before reevaluating the status of the VM and reporting the VM status as deallocated.
Note
In case of monitoring a Virtual Machine Scale Set, instances of a particular scale set selected for monitoring (either by the user or picked up by default as part of the coverage level selected) might get deallocated or scaled down in the middle of the 24-hour cycle. In this particular time period, Connection monitor will not be able to recognize this action and thus end-up reporting an indeterminate state due to the absence of data.
Users are advised to allow random selection of virtual machine scale sets instances within coverage levels instead of selecting particular instances of scale sets for monitoring, to minimize the risks of non-discoverability of deallocated or scaled down virtual machine scale sets instances in a 24-hour cycle and lead to an indeterminate state of connection monitor.
Checks in a test
Depending on the protocol that you select in the test configuration, Connection monitor runs a series of checks for the source-destination pair. The checks run according to the test frequency that you select.
If you use HTTP, the service calculates the number of HTTP responses that returned a valid response code. You can set valid response codes by using PowerShell and Azure CLI. The result determines the percentage of failed checks. To calculate RTT, the service measures the time between an HTTP call and the response.
If you use TCP or ICMP, the service calculates the packet-loss percentage to determine the percentage of failed checks. To calculate RTT, the service measures the time taken to receive the acknowledgment (ACK) for the packets that were sent. If you enabled traceroute data for your network tests, you can view the hop-by-hop loss and latency for your on-premises network.
States of a test
Depending on the data that the checks return, tests can have the following states:
Pass: Actual values for the percentage of failed checks and RTT are within the specified thresholds.
Fail: Actual values for the percentage of failed checks or RTT exceeded the specified thresholds. If no threshold is specified, a test reaches theFailstate when the percentage of failed checks is 100.
Warning:If a threshold is specified and Connection monitor observesâ¯a checks-failed percentage that's more thanâ¯80 percentâ¯of the threshold, the test is marked asWarning.In the absence of specifiedâ¯thresholds, Connection monitor automatically assigns a threshold. When that threshold is exceeded, the test status changes toWarning.â¯For round-trip timeâ¯in TCP or ICMP tests, the threshold is 750 milliseconds (ms). For the checks-failedâ¯percentage,â¯the threshold is 10 percent.

Data collection, analysis, and alerts
The data that Connection monitor collects is stored in the Log Analytics workspace. You set up this workspace when you created the connection monitor.
Monitoring data is also available in Azure Monitor Metrics. You can use Log Analytics to keep your monitoring data for as long as you want. Azure Monitor stores metrics for only 30 days by default.
You canset metric-based alerts on the data.
On the monitoring dashboards, you can view a list of the connection monitors that you can access for your subscriptions, regions, time stamps, sources, and destination types.
When you go to Connection monitor from Network Watcher, you can view data by:
Connection monitor: A list of all connection monitors that were created for your subscriptions, regions, time stamps, sources, and destination types. This view is the default.
Test groups: A list of all test groups that were created for your subscriptions, regions, time stamps, sources, and destination types. These test groups aren't filtered by connection monitors.
Test: A list of all tests that were run for your subscriptions, regions, time stamps, sources, and destination types. These tests aren't filtered by connection monitors or test groups.
In the following image, the three data views are indicated by arrow 1.
On the dashboard, you can expand each connection monitor to view its test groups. Then you can expand each test group to view the tests that run in it.
You can filter a list based on:
Top-level filters: Search the list by text, entity type (Connection monitor, test group, or test), timestamp, and scope. Scope includes subscriptions, regions,  sources, and destination types. See box 1 in the following image.

Use Log Analytics to create custom views of your monitoring data. All displayed data is from Log Analytics. You can interactively analyze data in the repository. Correlate the data from Agent Health or other solutions that are based on Log Analytics. Export the data to Excel or Power BI, or create a shareable link.
You usually build Connection monitor topology by using the result of a traceroute command that's performed by the agent. The traceroute command basically gets all the hops from source to destination.
However, in instances where either the source or destination lies within Azure boundaries, you build the topology by merging the results of two distinct operations.
The first operation is the result of the traceroute command. The second operation is the result of an internal command that identifies a logical route based on (customer) network configuration within Azure boundaries. This internal command is similar to the Network Watcher next hop diagnostics tool.
Because the second operation is logical and the first operation doesn't usually identify any hops within Azure boundaries, a few hops in the merged result (mostly those within Azure boundaries) won't display latency values.
In connection monitors that were created before the Connection monitor experience, all four metrics are available: % Probes Failed, AverageRoundtripMs, ChecksFailedPercent, and RoundTripTimeMs.
In connection monitors that were created in the Connection monitor experience, data is available only for ChecksFailedPercent, RoundTripTimeMs, and Test Result metrics.
Metrics are generated according to monitoring frequency, and they describe aspects of a connection monitor at a particular time. Connection monitor metrics also have multiple dimensions, such as SourceName, DestinationName, TestConfiguration, and TestGroup. You can use these dimensions to visualize specific data and target it while defining alerts.
Azure metrics currently allow a minimum granularity of 1 minute. If the frequency is less than 1 minute, aggregated results are displayed.

When you use metrics, set the resource type asMicrosoft.Network/networkWatchers/connectionMonitors.
You can create metric alerts on connection monitors by using the following methods:
From Connection monitor, create metric alerts during the creation of connection monitors usingtheâ¯Azure portal.

Azure virtual machines with the Network Watcher extension send data to both the workspace and the metrics. Connection monitor makes the data available through the new metrics (ChecksFailedPercent and RoundTripTimeMs) instead of the old metrics (ProbesFailedPercent and AverageRoundtripMs). The old metrics get migrated to new metrics as ProbesFailedPercent > ChecksFailedPercent and AverageRoundtripMs > RoundTripTimeMs.
