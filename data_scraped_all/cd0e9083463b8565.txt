This article provides descriptions of each field data type, query operator, and query macro. Some data types, operators, and macros are only valid for the indicated Azure DevOps version.
For more information, seeQuery quick referenceandManage and organize queries.
Prerequisites
Note
Users withStakeholderaccess for a public project have full access to query features just like users withBasicaccess. For more information, seeStakeholder access quick reference.

Query field data types and values
The value you specify for a field must conform to the data type for that field. The following table lists the supported data types:
Note
For Azure Boards cloud service, the data type corresponds to that listed for the field on theProcess>Fields page. For on-premises deployments, the data type corresponds to thetypeattribute assigned to aFIELDdefinition. For more information, seeWork item fields and field attributes.
type
FIELD
Data type
Description
Boolean
Specifies a field that takes on a True/False value.
DateTimeorDate/Time
A date field in which you can specify a variable, such as@Todayor@Today-1, or a value, such as01/01/2025. Enter dates in the Date Pattern you set for your personal profile. (SeeSet personal preferencesfor details.) For query examples, seeQuery by date or@CurrentIteration.
01/01/2025
For WIQL queries, you can also specify the date in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) pattern. For more information, seeSyntax for the Work Item Query Language (WIQL).
DoubleorDecimal
A real number, such as 0.2 or 3.5. For query examples, seeQuery by numeric fields.
GUID
A character string that represents a unique ID.
History
Custom formatted field used to track historical information. This data type is only used to support theHistoryfield. This field is automatically indexed for full-text search when full-text search is available. SeeFull-Text and partial word searchesdescribed later in this article. For query examples, seeHistory and auditing.
HTML
Text strings that support formatted descriptions, such as theDescriptionorRepro Stepsfields. These fields are automatically indexed for full-text search when full-text search is available. SeeFull-Text and partial word searchesdescribed later in this article. To query rich-text fields, seeQuery by titles, IDs, and rich-text fields.
Identity
Short text string that identifies a user identity.
Integer
A 32-bit integer that is signed, such as 0, 1, 2, 34.
PlainTextorText field (multi-line)
Text strings that support long descriptions, such as theApplication Start Informationfield. These fields are automatically indexed for full-text search, when full-text search is available. SeeFull-Text and partial word searchesdescribed later in this article. To query plain-text fields, seeQuery by titles, IDs, and rich-text fields.
picklistDouble
Custom field defined to contain a pick list of Decimal values.
picklistInteger
Custom field defined to contain a pick list of Integer values.
picklistString
Custom field defined to contain a pick list of short text string (255 characters or less) values.
StringorText field (single line)
Short text string that can contain up to 255 Unicode characters. String text fields are often used to support picklists or drop-down menus.
TreePath
A branching tree structure, such as an Area Path or Iteration path. Choose an item from a list of valid values. Find work items that are equal to, not equal to, under, or not under a tree structure. You can also use theInorNot Inoperators to specify multiple values. Define the tree structure for a projectâarea pathsanditeration pathsâand then select the ones you want to associate with a team.

Not In
For more information on constructing queries, seeQuery by area or iteration pathorQuery by date or current iteration.
Note
Thepicklist...data types are only assigned to custom fields defined for an inherited process.
Date and time pattern
The date and time pattern you enter forDateTimefields should match that which you select through your profile. To view or change your selection, seeSet user preferences.

Was Ever
Matches the value in the clause at any previous point.
String,DateTime
Note
Was Everon date fields isn't currently supported when using the Query Editor. They're only supported when doing a direct WIQL.
Tip
It's possible to construct a query using WIQL syntax that uses an operator, such asWas Ever, for other data type fields than those listed. For example, you can useWas Everwithin a clause using theIteration Path. For an example, seeQuery by date or current iteration, List work items moved out of a sprint.

Query macros or variables
You can use the macros described in the following table to filter your queries based on specific fields.
Note
The following macros are only supported from the web portal:@CurrentIteration,@CurrentIteration +/- n,@Follows,@MyRecentActivity,@RecentMentions,@RecentProjectActivity, and@TeamAreas. Queries that contain these macros won't work when opened in Visual Studio/Team Explorer, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Project.
Macro
Description
[Any]
Use with theWork Item TypeorStatefields to search across all work item types or across all states. For example,Work Item Type=[Any]doesn't place any filters based on the work item type.
Work Item Type=[Any]
@CurrentIteration
Use with theIteration Pathfield to automatically filter for work items assigned to the current sprint based on thecurrent team focus or context. For specific examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.The@CurrentIterationmacro only works when run from the web portal. You can't use the macro whencopying or cloning test suites and test cases,defining alerts, or withREST APIs.
@CurrentIteration +/- n
Use with theIteration Pathfield to filter the set of work items assigned to the current sprint +/-nsprints based on thecurrent team focus or context. For specific examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.The@CurrentIteration +/- nmacro is supported for Azure Boards, Azure DevOps Server when run from the web portal.
@Follows
Use with theIDfield andInoperator to list all work items that you're following in the project. For more information, seeFollow a work item or pull request. You can view this same list from theWork Items page,Followingpivot view.The@Followsmacro is supported only when run from the web portal.
@Me
Use with an identity or user account field to automatically search for items associated with your user or account name. For example, you can find work items that you opened with the clauseCreated By=@Me. For more examples, seeQuery by assignment, workflow, or board changes.
Created By=@Me
@MyRecentActivity
Use with theIDfield andInoperator to list work items you viewed or updated in the project within the last 30 days. You can view this same list from theWork Items page,My activitypivot view.
@Project
Use with theTeam Projectfield to filter for work items in other projects. For example, you can find all the work items in the currently selected project with the clauseTeam Project=@Project. The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current project. For more information, seeDefine a query, Query across projects.
Team Project=@Project
@RecentMentions
Use with theIDfield andInoperator to list work items where you're mentioned in the Discussion section. You can view this same list from theWork Items page,Mentionedpivot view.
@RecentProjectActivity
Use with theIDfield andInoperator to list work items recently updated. The number of work items listed depends on the work tracking activity of the project. For highly active projects, the macro lists work items updated in the project within the last 30 days or so. For less active projects, however, this list could include work items older than 30 days. You can view similar lists from theWork Items page,Recently created,Recently updatedandRecently completedpivot views. The number of work items returned is capped at 5000.
@StartOfDay
Use with aDateTimefield to filter for work items that relate to the current date or with a plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all items closed in the last week with the clauseClosed Date&gt;=@StartOfDay-7. For more examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.
DateTime
Closed Date&gt;=@StartOfDay-7
@StartOfMonth
Use with aDateTimefield to filter for work items that relate to the current month or with a plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all items created in the last three months with the clauseCreated Date&gt;=@StartOfMonth-3. For more examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.
DateTime
Created Date&gt;=@StartOfMonth-3
@StartOfWeek
Use with aDateTimefield to filter for work items that relate to the current week or with a plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all items changed in the last two weeks with the clauseChanged Date&gt;=@StartOfWeek-2. For more examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.
DateTime
Changed Date&gt;=@StartOfWeek-2
@StartOfYear
Use with aDateTimefield to filter for work items that relate to the current year or with a plus/minus offset. For example, you can find all features that have a Target Date scheduled within the current year with the clauseTarget Date&gt;=@StartOfYear. For more examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.
DateTime
Target Date&gt;=@StartOfYear
@TeamAreas
Only use with theArea Pathfield to filter for work items whose area path corresponds to one assigned to a specific team. Requires you use the=operator. For example, you can find all items assigned to the area paths assigned to the Web team with the clauseArea Path=@TeamAreas [Fabrikam Fiber]\Web. For more examples, seeQuery by area or iteration path.The@TeamAreasmacro is supported for Azure DevOps Server only when run from the web portal.
Area Path=@TeamAreas [Fabrikam Fiber]\Web
@Today
Use with aDateTimefield to filter for work items that relate to the current date or to an earlier date. You can also modify the@Todaymacro by subtracting days. For example, you can find all items created in the last week with the clauseCreated Date&gt;=@Today-7. For more examples, seeQuery by date or current iteration.
DateTime
Created Date&gt;=@Today-7

Full-text and partial word searches
SpecifyContainsorDoes Not Containto search against exact or partial matches of a word or phrase. These operators filter items based on the full-text search index created for long-text fields. SpecifyContains WordsorDoes Not Contain Wordsto search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character,*. These operators use the full-text search index. You can only use the wildcard character at the end of a partial word or phrase.
For examples, seeExample work item queriesandQuery for work items using the History field.
Note
Not all deployments support full-text searches. For example, SQL Express and SQL Azure, which support the cloud service, do not support full-text search. In these instances, you only see theContainsandDoes not Containoperators.
Azure DevOps Server automatically indexes all long-text fields with a data type ofPlainTextandHTMLand theTitlefield for full-text search. The index and operators are only available when the SQL Server that supports Azure DevOps Server supports full-text search.
Full-text searches require a SQL collation that corresponds to a language that has a word breaker registered with SQL Server. If the collation settings for the project collection database used for your Azure DevOps Server instance don't correspond to a supported language, your search results might not match your expectations. In these cases, you might try using theContainsorDoes Not Containoperators.
For more information, seeFull-Text Search Queries and Collation Settings.
