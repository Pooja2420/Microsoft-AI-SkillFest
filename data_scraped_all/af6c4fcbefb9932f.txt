TheEntity Recognitionskill (v2) extracts entities of different types from text. This skill uses the machine learning models provided byText Analyticsin Azure AI services.
Important
The Entity Recognition skill (v2) (Microsoft.Skills.Text.EntityRecognitionSkill) is now discontinued replaced byMicrosoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityRecognitionSkill. Follow the recommendations inDeprecated skillsto migrate to a supported skill.
Note
As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need toattach a billable Azure AI services resource. Charges accrue when calling APIs in Azure AI services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure AI Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.
Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existingAzure AI services pay-as-you go price. Image extraction pricing is described on theAzure AI Search pricing page.

Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured byString.Length. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using theText Split skill. If you do use a text split skill, set the page length to 5000 for the best performance.

Note that the offsets returned for entities in the output of this skill are directly returned from theText Analytics API, which means if you are using them to index into the original string, you should use theStringInfoclass in .NET in order to extract the correct content.More details can be found here.
Warning cases
If the language code for the document is unsupported, a warning is returned and no entities are extracted.
