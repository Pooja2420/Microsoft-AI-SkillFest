Inputs
certSecureFile-Certificate (P12)string. Required.
certSecureFile
string
Specifies the certificate (.p12) that was uploaded toSecure Filesto install on the macOS agent.
Secure Files
certPwd-Certificate (P12) passwordstring.
certPwd
string
Specifies the password to the Apple certificate (.p12). Use a new build variable with its lock enabled on theVariablestab to encrypt this value.
Variables
keychain-Keychainstring. Required. Allowed values:default(Default Keychain),temp(Temporary Keychain),custom(Custom Keychain). Default value:temp.
keychain
string
default
temp
custom
temp
Specifies the keychain in which to install the Apple certificate. For Microsoft-hosted builds, useTemporary Keychain. A temporary keychain will always be deleted after the build or release is complete.
Temporary Keychain
keychainPassword-Keychain passwordstring. Required whenkeychain = custom || keychain = default.
keychainPassword
string
keychain = custom || keychain = default
Specifies the password to unlock the keychain. Use a new build variable with its lock enabled on theVariablestab to encrypt this value. A password is generated for the temporary keychain if not specified.
Variables
customKeychainPath-Custom keychain pathstring. Required whenkeychain = custom.
customKeychainPath
string
keychain = custom
Specifies the full path to a custom keychain file. The keychain will be created if it does not already exist.
deleteCert-Delete certificate from keychainboolean. Optional. Use whenkeychain = custom || keychain = default.
deleteCert
boolean
keychain = custom || keychain = default
Specifies the certificate to delete from the keychain after the build or release is complete.
deleteCustomKeychain-Delete custom keychainboolean. Optional. Use whenkeychain = custom.
deleteCustomKeychain
boolean
keychain = custom
Specifies the custom keychain to delete from the agent after the build or release is complete.
signingIdentity-Certificate signing identitystring.
signingIdentity
string
Specifies theCommon Nameof the subject in the signing certificate.  Will attempt to parse theCommon Nameif this is left empty.
Common Name
Common Name
setUpPartitionIdACLForPrivateKey-Set up partition_id ACL for the imported private keyboolean.
setUpPartitionIdACLForPrivateKey
boolean
Iftrue, sets thepartition_idACL for the imported private key so thatcodesignwon't prompt to use the key for signing. This isn't necessary for temporary keychains on MacOS High Sierra. Learn more aboutOpen Radar.
true
partition_id
codesign
opensslPkcsArgs-OpenSSL arguments for PKCS12string.
opensslPkcsArgs
string
Arguments for extraction certificate information using openssl.

signingIdentitySpecifies the resolvedCommon Nameof the subject in the signing certificate. Either supplied as an input or parsed from the P12 certificate file.
signingIdentity
Common Name
keychainPathSpecifies the path for the keychain file with the certificate.
keychainPath
