Applies to:SQL Server on Azure VM
Automated Patching establishes a maintenance window for an Azure virtual machine running SQL Server. Automated Updates can only be installed during this maintenance window. For SQL Server, this restriction ensures that system updates and any associated restarts occur at the best possible time for the database.
Important
Theautomated patchingfeature will retire. Currently scheduled for September 17, 2027. To avoid service disruptions, migrate toAzure Update Managerbefore this date. Avoid automated patching in new environments. For existing environments, migrate toAzure Update Manageras soon as possible to continue receiving future enhancements for the patching feature on your SQL Server on Azure VM.
With automated patching, only Windows and SQL Server updates marked asImportantorCriticalare installed. Other SQL Server updates, such as service packs and cumulative updates that are not marked asImportantorCritical, must be installed manually. To automatically install Cumulative Updates, use the integratedAzure Update Managerexperience instead.
Prerequisites
To use Automated Patching, you need the following prerequisites:
Automated Patching relies on the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension. Current SQL virtual machine gallery images add this extension by default. For more information, reviewSQL Server IaaS Agent Extension.
Install the latest Azure PowerShell commandsif you plan to configure Automated Patching by using PowerShell.
Automated Patching is supported starting with SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server 2012.
Additionally, consider the following:
There are also several other ways to enable automatic patching of Azure VMs, such asUpdate ManagerorAutomatic VM guest patching. Choose only one option to automatically update your VM as overlapping tools may lead to failed updates.
If you want to receiveESU updateswithout using the automated patching feature, you can use the built-in Windows Update channel.
For SQL Server VMs in different availability zones that participate in an Always On availability group, configure the automated patching schedule so that availability replicas in different availability zones aren't patched at the same time.
Settings
The following table describes the options that can be configured for Automated Patching. The actual configuration steps vary depending on whether you use the Azure portal or Azure Windows PowerShell commands.
Configure in the Azure portal
You can use the Azure portal to configure Automated Patching during provisioning or for existing VMs.
New VMs
Use the Azure portal to configure Automated Patching when you create a new SQL Server virtual machine in the Resource Manager deployment model.
On theSQL Server settingstab, selectChange configurationunderAutomated patching. The following Azure portal screenshot shows theSQL Automated Patchingpane.

For more information, seeProvision a SQL Server virtual machine on Azure.
Existing VMs
For existing SQL Server virtual machines, open yourSQL virtual machines resourceand selectUpdatesunderSettings.
If you've never enabled theAzure Update Managerexperience for any SQL Server VM in your portal, then selectEnableto enable Automated Patching for your existing SQL Server VM.

If you've used the Azure Update Manager before, you'll need to go to theUpdatespage underSettingsin yourSQL virtual machines resourceand then chooseLeave new experienceto go back to theAutomated Patchingexperience:

After you've enabled Automated Patching and configured your patching settings, select theOKbutton on the bottom of theUpdatespage to save your changes.
If you're enabling Automated Patching for the first time, Azure configures the SQL Server IaaS Agent in the background. During this time, the Azure portal might not show that Automated Patching is configured. Wait several minutes for the agent to be installed and configured. After that the Azure portal reflects the new settings.
Configure with PowerShell
After provisioning your SQL VM, use PowerShell to configure Automated Patching.
In the following example, PowerShell is used to configure Automated Patching on an existing SQL Server VM. TheNew-AzVMSqlServerAutoPatchingConfigcommand configures a new maintenance window for automatic updates.
Update-AzSqlVM -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegroupname' -Name 'vmname' `
-AutoPatchingSettingDayOfWeek Thursday `
-AutoPatchingSettingMaintenanceWindowDuration 120 `
-AutoPatchingSettingMaintenanceWindowStartingHour 11 `
-AutoPatchingSettingEnable
Update-AzSqlVM -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegroupname' -Name 'vmname' `
-AutoPatchingSettingDayOfWeek Thursday `
-AutoPatchingSettingMaintenanceWindowDuration 120 `
-AutoPatchingSettingMaintenanceWindowStartingHour 11 `
-AutoPatchingSettingEnable
Based on this example, the following table describes the practical effect on the target Azure VM:
It could take several minutes to install and configure the SQL Server IaaS Agent.
To disable Automated Patching, run the following script with the value of$falseon the-AutoPatchingSettingEnable.
Update-AzSqlVM -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegroupname' -Name 'vmname' -AutoPatchingSettingEnable:$false
Update-AzSqlVM -ResourceGroupName 'resourcegroupname' -Name 'vmname' -AutoPatchingSettingEnable:$false
Understand which updates will be applied with Automated Patching
To understand which updates will be applied through Automated Patching, review theupdate guideand apply theSeverityfilter to identify Critical and Important updates.
Considerations
Consider the following:
Automated Patching isn't aware of Always On availability group configurations for your SQL Server VM, so be cautious when creating patching schedules for availability group replicas to avoid unexpected failovers.
If your SQL Server VMs are in an availability set and you've configured an Always On availability group, both nodes might be restarted if patches are applied at the same time, so it's important the patching schedules are set for a different day/time for each node.
Migrate from Automated Patching to Azure Update Manager
Azure Update Manageris a unified service to help you manage and govern updates for all your virtual machines and SQL Server instances at scale. Unlike with Automated Patching,Azure Update Managerinstalls Cumulative Updates for SQL Server. It is recommended to only use one automated patching service to manage updates for your SQL Server VM.
If you are currently using Automated Patching, you canmigrate to Azure Update Manager
