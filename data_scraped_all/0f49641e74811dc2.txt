To secure app deployment from a local computer,Azure App Servicesupports two types of credentials forlocal Git deploymentandFTP/FTPS deployment. These credentials are different from your Azure subscription credentials.
User-level credentials: One set of credentials for the entire Azure account. These credentials can be used to deploy to App Service for any app in any subscription that the Azure account has permission to access. This credentials set is the default that surfaces in the portal's graphical environment, like inOverviewandPropertieson the app'sresource pane. When a user is granted app access via role-based access control (RBAC) or coadministrator permissions, they can use their user-level credentials until access is revoked. Don't share these credentials with other Azure users.

App-level credentials: One set of credentials for each app. These credentials can be used to deploy to that app only. The credentials for each app are generated automatically at app creation. They can't be configured manually, but can be reset anytime. To grant a user access to app-level credentials via RBAC, that user must haveContributorlevel or higher permissions on the app (including the built-inWebsite Contributorrole). Readers aren't allowed to publish, and can't access those credentials.

Whenbasic authentication is disabled, you can't view or configure deployment credentials inDeployment Center.
Configure user-scope credentials
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Azure portal
Run theaz webapp deployment user setcommand. Replace<username>and<password>with a deployment user's username and password.
az webapp deployment user set
<username>
<password>
The username must be unique within Azure, and for local Git pushes, must not contain the @ symbol.
The password must be at least eight characters long, with two of the following three elements: letters, numbers, and symbols.
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>
The JSON output shows the password asnull.
null
You can't configure the user-scope credentials by using Azure PowerShell. Use a different method, or considerusing application-scope credentials.
You can configure your user-scope credentials in any app'sresource page. Regardless of which app you use to configure these credentials, the credentials apply to all apps for all subscriptions in your Azure account.
You must have at least one app in theAzure portalbefore you can access the deployment credentials page. To configure your user-scope credentials:
From the left menu of your app, select >Deployment Center>FTPS credentialsorLocal Git/FTPS credentials.
From the left menu of your app, select >Deployment Center>FTPS credentialsorLocal Git/FTPS credentials.
Scroll down toUser scope, configure theUsernameandPassword, and then selectSave.
Scroll down toUser scope, configure theUsernameandPassword, and then selectSave.
After you set your deployment credentials, you can find the Git deployment username in your app'sOverviewpage.

If Git deployment is configured, the page showsGit/deployment username. Otherwise, it showsFTP/deployment username.
Note
Azure doesn't show your user-scope deployment password. If you forget the password, you can follow the steps in this section to reset your credentials.
Use user-scope credentials with FTP/FTPS
To authenticate to an FTP/FTPS endpoint by using user-scope credentials, your username must follow this format:<app-name>\<user-name>
<app-name>\<user-name>
Since user-scope credentials are linked to the user and not to a specific resource, the username must be in this format to direct the sign-in action to the right app endpoint.
Get application-scope credentials
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Azure portal
Get the application-scope credentials by using theaz webapp deployment list-publishing-profilescommand. For example:
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name>
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name>
Forlocal Git deployment, you can also use theaz webapp deployment list-publishing-credentialscommand. When you use this command, you get a Git remote URI for your app that has the application-scope credentials already embedded. For example:
az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials
az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --query scmUri
az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --query scmUri
Note
The returned Git remote URI doesn't contain/<app-name>.gitat the end. When you add the remote URI, make sure to append/<app-name>.gitto avoid an error 22 withgit-http-push. Additionally, when usinggit remote add ...via shells that use the dollar sign for variable interpolation (such as bash), escape any dollar signs\$in the username or password. Failure to escape this character can result in authentication errors.
/<app-name>.git
/<app-name>.git
git-http-push
git remote add ...
\$
Get the application-scope credentials by using theGet-AzWebAppPublishingProfilecommand. For example:
Get-AzWebAppPublishingProfile
Get-AzWebAppPublishingProfile -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name>
Get-AzWebAppPublishingProfile -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name>
From the left menu of your app, selectDeployment Center>FTPS credentialsorLocal Git/FTPS credentials.
From the left menu of your app, selectDeployment Center>FTPS credentialsorLocal Git/FTPS credentials.
In theApplication scopesection, select theCopylink to copy the username or password.

Reset application-scope credentials
Azure CLI
Azure PowerShell
Azure portal
Reset the application-scope credentials by using theaz resource invoke-actioncommand:
az resource invoke-action
az resource invoke-action --action newpassword --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites
az resource invoke-action --action newpassword --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites
Reset the application-scope credentials by using theInvoke-AzResourceActioncommand:
Invoke-AzResourceAction
Invoke-AzResourceAction -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites -ResourceName <app-name> -Action newpassword
Invoke-AzResourceAction -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites -ResourceName <app-name> -Action newpassword
From the left menu of your app, selectDeployment Center>FTPS credentialsorLocal Git/FTPS credentials.
From the left menu of your app, selectDeployment Center>FTPS credentialsorLocal Git/FTPS credentials.
In theApplication scopesection, selectReset.
In theApplication scopesection, selectReset.
