If your subscription is not listed or if you want to use an existing Service Principal, you can setup an Azure service connection using 'Add' or 'Manage' button.
azureResourceGroup-Resource groupstring. Required whenaction != bake && connectionType = azureResourceManager.
azureResourceGroup
string
action != bake && connectionType = azureResourceManager
Select an Azure resource group.

string
Specifies the namespace for the commands by using theânamespaceflag. If the namespace is not provided, the commands will run in the default namespace.
ânamespace
strategy-Strategystring. Optional. Use whenaction = deploy || action = promote || action = reject. Allowed values:canary,none. Default value:none.
strategy
string
action = deploy || action = promote || action = reject
canary
none
none
Specifies the deployment strategy used in thedeployaction before apromoteaction orrejectaction. Currently,canaryis the only acceptable deployment strategy.
deploy
promote
reject
canary
trafficSplitMethod-Traffic split methodstring. Optional. Use whenstrategy = canary. Allowed values:pod,smi. Default value:pod.
trafficSplitMethod
string
strategy = canary
pod
smi
pod
For the valuesmi, the percentage traffic split is done at the request level by using a service mesh. A service mesh must be set up by a cluster admin. This task handles orchestration of SMITrafficSplitobjects.
smi
For the valuepod, the percentage split isn't possible at the request level in the absence of a service mesh. Instead, the percentage input is used to calculate the replicas for baseline and canary. The calculation is a percentage of replicas that are specified in the input manifests for the stable variant.
pod
percentage-Percentagestring. Required whenstrategy = Canary && action = deploy. Default value:0.
percentage
string
strategy = Canary && action = deploy
0
The percentage that is used to compute the number of baseline-variant and canary-variant replicas of the workloads that are contained in manifest files.
For the specified percentage input, calculate:
(percentageÃnumber of replicas) / 100
If the result isn't an integer, the mathematical floor of the result is used when baseline and canary variants are created.
For example, assume the deploymenthello-worldis in the input manifest file and that the following lines are in the task input:
hello-world
replicas: 4
strategy: canary
percentage: 25
replicas: 4
strategy: canary
percentage: 25
In this case, the deploymentshello-world-baselineandhello-world-canaryare created with one replica each. The baseline variant is created with the same image and tag as the stable version, which is the four-replica variant before deployment. The canary variant is created with the image and tag corresponding to the newly deployed changes.
hello-world-baseline
hello-world-canary
baselineAndCanaryReplicas-Baseline and canary replicasstring. Required whenstrategy = Canary && action = deploy && trafficSplitMethod = SMI. Default value:1.
baselineAndCanaryReplicas
string
strategy = Canary && action = deploy && trafficSplitMethod = SMI
1
When you settrafficSplitMethodtosmi, the percentage traffic split is controlled in the service mesh plane. You can control the actual number of replicas for canary and baseline variants independently of the traffic split.
trafficSplitMethod
smi
For example, assume that the input deployment manifest specifies 30 replicas for the stable variant. Also assume that you specify the following input for the task:
strategy: canary
trafficSplitMethod: smi
percentage: 20
baselineAndCanaryReplicas: 1
strategy: canary
trafficSplitMethod: smi
percentage: 20
baselineAndCanaryReplicas: 1
In this case, the stable variant receives 80% of the traffic, while the baseline and canary variants each receive half of the specified 20%. Baseline and canary variants don't receive three replicas each. They instead receive the specified number of replicas, which means they each receive one replica.

Remarks
You can create a Kubernetes service connection with any of the following options.
KubeConfig
Service Account
Azure Subscription

When selecting theAzure Subscriptionoption, Kubernetes needs to be accessible to Azure DevOps at service connection configuration time. There may be various reasons a service connection cannot be created, for example youcreated a private clusteror the cluster haslocal accounts disabled. In these cases, Azure DevOps can't connect to your cluster at service connection configuration time and you'll see a stuckLoading namespacesscreen.

Starting with Kubernetes 1.24, long-lived tokens areno longer created by default. Kubernetes recommends not using long-lived tokens. As a result, tasks using a Kubernetes service connection created with theAzure Subscriptionoption don't have access to the permanent token required to authenticate and canât access your Kubernetes cluster. This also results in the frozenLoading namespacesdialog.
For AKS customers, the Azure Resource Manager service connection type provides the best method to connect to a private cluster, or a cluster that has local accounts disabled. This method is not dependent on cluster connectivity at the time you create a service connection. Access to AKS is deferred to pipeline runtime, which has the following advantages:
Access to a (private) AKS cluster can be performed from a self-hosted or scale set agent with line of sight to the cluster.
A token is created for every task that uses an Azure Resource Manager service connection. This ensures you are connecting to Kubernetes with a short-lived token, which is theKubernetes recommendation.
AKS can be accessed even when local accounts are disabled.
You are using the Kubernetes service connection with Azure Subscription option. We are updating this method to create long-lived tokens. This is expected to be available mid-May. However, it is recommended to start using the Azure service connection type and not o use long-lived tokens as perKubernetes guidance.
We are updating this method to create long-lived tokens. This is expected to be available mid-May. However, please be aware that this approach is againstKubernetes guidance.
You tasks will continue to work as before.
Our Kubernetes tasks work with any Kubernetes cluster, regardless where they are running. The Kubernetes service connection will continue to exist.
There is no need to change anything. If you are using the Kubernetes service connection and selected Azure Subscription during creation, you should be aware of theKubernetes guidance on using long-lived tokens.
In case you canât access your AKS during environment creation time, you can use an empty environment and set theconnectionTypeinput to an Azure Resource Manager service connection.

Accessing Kubernetes when AAD RBAC is enabled is unrelated to token creation. To prevent an interactive prompt, we will supportkubeloginin a future update.
Use a Kubernetes manifest task in a build or release pipeline to bake and deploy manifests to Kubernetes clusters.
This task supports the following:
Artifact substitution: The deployment action takes as input a list of container images that you can specify along with their tags and digests. The same input is substituted into the nontemplatized manifest files before application to the cluster. This substitution ensures that the cluster nodes pull the right version of the image.

Secret handling: ThecreateSecretaction lets Docker registry secrets be created using Docker registry service connections. It also lets generic secrets be created using either plain-text variables or secret variables. Before deployment to the cluster, you can use thesecretsinput along with thedeployaction to augment the input manifest files with the appropriateimagePullSecretsvalue.

Deployment strategy: Choosing thecanarystrategy with thedeployaction leads to the creation of workload names suffixed with-baselineand-canary. The task supports two methods of traffic splitting:Service Mesh Interface:Service Mesh Interface(SMI) abstraction allows configuration with service mesh providers likeLinkerdandIstio. The Kubernetes Manifest task maps SMITrafficSplitobjects to the stable, baseline, and canary services during the life cycle of the deployment strategy.Canary deployments that are based on a service mesh and use this task are more accurate. This accuracy is due to how service mesh providers enable the granular percentage-based split of traffic. The service mesh uses the service registry and sidecar containers that are injected into pods. This injection occurs alongside application containers to achieve the granular traffic split.Kubernetes with no service mesh: In the absence of a service mesh, you might not get the exact percentage split you want at the request level. However, you can do canary deployments by using baseline and canary variants next to the stable variant.The service sends requests to pods of all three workload variants as the selector-label constraints are met. Kubernetes Manifest honors these requests when creating baseline and canary variants. This routing behavior achieves the intended effect of routing only a portion of total requests to the canary.Compare the baseline and canary workloads by using either aManual Intervention taskin release pipelines or aDelay taskin YAML pipelines. Do the comparison before using the promote or reject action of the task.

      some-secret
      some-other-secret
In the above example, the task tries to find matches for the imagesfoo/demoandbar/demoin the image fields of manifest files. For each match found, the value of eithertagVariable1ortagVariable2is appended as a tag to the image name. You can also specify digests in the containers input for artifact substitution.
foo/demo
bar/demo
tagVariable1
tagVariable2
Note
While you can authordeploy,promote, andrejectactions with YAML input related to deployment strategy, support for a Manual Intervention task is currently unavailable for build pipelines.
deploy
promote
reject
For release pipelines, we advise you to use actions and input related to deployment strategy in the following sequence:
A deploy action specified withstrategy: canaryandpercentage: $(someValue).
strategy: canary
percentage: $(someValue)
A Manual Intervention task so that you can pause the pipeline and compare the baseline variant with the canary variant.
A promote action that runs if a Manual Intervention task is resumed and a reject action that runs if a Manual Intervention task is rejected.

Troubleshooting
You can grant hosted agents access through your firewall by allowing the IP addresses for the hosted agents. For more details, seeAgent IP ranges.
The label selector relationship between pods and services in Kubernetes allows for setting up deployments so that a single service routes requests to both the stable and the canary variants. The Kubernetes manifest task uses this for canary deployments.
If the task includes the inputs ofaction: deployandstrategy: canary, for each workload (Deployment, ReplicaSet, Pod, ...) defined in the input manifest files, a-baselineand-canaryvariant of the deployment are created. In this example, there's a deploymentsampleappin the input manifest file and that after completion of run number 22 of the pipeline, the stable variant of this deployment namedsampleappis deployed in the cluster. In the subsequent run (in this case run number 23), Kubernetes manifest task withaction: deployandstrategy: canarywould result in creation of sampleapp-baseline and sampleapp-canary deployments whose number of replicas are determined by the product ofpercentagetask input with the value of the desired number of replicas for the final stable variant ofsampleappas per the input manifest files.
action: deploy
strategy: canary
-baseline
-canary
sampleapp
sampleapp
action: deploy
strategy: canary
percentage
sampleapp
Excluding the number of replicas, the baseline version has the same configuration as the stable variant while the canary version has the new changes that are being introduced by the current run (in this case, run number 23). If a manual intervention is set up in the pipeline after the above mentioned step, it would allow for an opportunity to pause the pipeline so that the pipeline admin can evaluate key metrics for the baseline and canary versions and take the decision on whether the canary changes are safe and good enough for a complete rollout.
Theaction: promoteandstrategy: canaryoraction: rejectandstrategy: canaryinputs of the Kubernetes manifest tasks can be used to promote or reject the canary changes respectively. Note that in either cases, at the end of this step, only the stable variant of the workloads declared in the input manifest files will be remain deployed in the cluster, while the ephemeral baseline and canary versions are cleaned up.
action: promote
strategy: canary
action: reject
strategy: canary
