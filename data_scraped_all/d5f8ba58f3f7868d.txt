For machines running Windows Server 2019 or later, the Defender for Endpoint agent is updated as part of continuous operating system updates. Make sure Windows machines have the latest update installed. Learn more about using theWindows Servers Update Service to install machines at scale.
For machines running Windows Servers 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2,update machines manually to the latest agent version. You can installKB 5005292 from the Microsoft Update Catalog. KB 5005292 is periodically updated with the latest agent version.

After the MDE.Linux extension is installed on a Linux machine, it attempts to update the agent version each time the VM reboots. You can alsoupdate the agent version manually.
