To help Azure Trusted Launch better prevent malicious rootkit attacks on virtual machines (VMs), guest attestation through an Azure Attestation endpoint is used to monitor the boot sequence integrity. This attestation is critical to provide the validity of a platform's states.
YourTrusted Launch VMneeds Secure Boot and virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) to be enabled so that the attestation extensions can be installed. Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers reports based on Guest Attestation verifying status and that the boot integrity of your VM is set up correctly. To learn more about Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration, seeTrusted Launch integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Important
Automatic Extension Upgrade is now available for the Boot Integrity Monitoring - Guest Attestation extension. For more information, seeAutomatic Extension Upgrade.
Prerequisites
You need an active Azure subscription and a Trusted Launch VM.
Enable integrity monitoring
To enable integrity monitoring, follow the steps in this section.

Create a VM with Trusted Launch that has Secure Boot and vTPM capabilities through initial deployment of a Trusted Launch VM. To deploy the Guest Attestation extension, use--enable-integrity-monitoring. As the VM owner, you can customize VM configuration by usingaz vm create.
--enable-integrity-monitoring
az vm create
For existing VMs, you can enable boot integrity monitoring settings by updating to make sure that integrity monitoring is turned on. You can use--enable-integrity-monitoring.
--enable-integrity-monitoring
Note
The Guest Attestation extension must be configured explicitly.
If Secure Boot and vTPM are set toON, then boot integrity is also set toON.

For existing VMs, you can enable boot integrity monitoring settings by updating. Make sure that both Secure Boot and vTPM are set toON.

Troubleshooting guide for Guest Attestation extension installation
This section addresses attestation errors and solutions.
Symptoms
The Azure Attestation extension won't work properly when you set up a network security group (NSG) or a proxy. An error appears that looks similar to "Microsoft.Azure.Security.WindowsAttestation.GuestAttestationprovisioning failed."
Microsoft.Azure.Security.WindowsAttestation.GuestAttestation

Solutions
In Azure, NSGs are used to help filter network traffic between Azure resources. NSGs contain security rules that either allow or deny inbound network traffic, or outbound network traffic from several types of Azure resources. The Azure Attestation endpoint should be able to communicate with the Guest Attestation extension. Without this endpoint, Trusted Launch can't access guest attestation, which allows Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor the integrity of the boot sequence of your VMs.
To unblock Azure Attestation traffic in NSGs by using service tags:
Go to the VM that you want to allow outbound traffic.
Go to the VM that you want to allow outbound traffic.
On the leftmost pane, underNetworking, selectNetworking settings.
On the leftmost pane, underNetworking, selectNetworking settings.
Then selectCreate port rule>Outbound port rule.
Then selectCreate port rule>Outbound port rule.

To allow Azure Attestation, you make the destination a service tag. This setting allows for the range of IP addresses to update and automatically set rules that allow Azure Attestation. SetDestination service tagtoAzureAttestationand setActiontoAllow.

Firewalls protect a virtual network, which contains multiple Trusted Launch VMs. To unblock Azure Attestation traffic in a firewall by using an application rule collection:
Go to the Azure Firewall instance that has traffic blocked from the Trusted Launch VM resource.
Go to the Azure Firewall instance that has traffic blocked from the Trusted Launch VM resource.
UnderSettings, selectRules (classic)to begin unblocking guest attestation behind the firewall.

Regional shared providers
Azure Attestation provides aregional shared providerin each available region. You can choose to use the regional shared provider for attestation or create your own providers with custom policies. Any Microsoft Entra user can access shared providers. The policy associated with it can't be changed.
Note
You can configure the source type, service, destination port ranges, protocol, priority, and name.
