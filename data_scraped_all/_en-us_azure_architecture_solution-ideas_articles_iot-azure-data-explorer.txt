IoT analytics with Azure Data Explorer and Azure IoT Hub
Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
This solution idea describes how Azure Data Explorer provides near real-time analytics for fast flowing, high volume streaming data from internet of things (IoT) devices and sensors. This analytics workflow is part of an overall IoT solution that integrates operational and analytical workloads with Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Data Explorer.

Azure Data Explorer ingests data for analytics, using its connectors forAzure Event Hubs,Azure IoT Hub, orKafkafor low latency and high throughput.Alternatively, you can ingest blobs from yourAzure Blob StorageorAzure Data Lake Storageaccount into Azure Data Explorer by using anEvent Grid data connection.You can also continuously export data to Azure Storage in compressed, partitionedApache Parquetformat, and seamlessly query the data with Azure Data Explorer. For details, seeContinuous data export overview.

To serve both the operational and analytical use cases, data can either route to Azure Data Explorer and Azure Cosmos DB in parallel, or from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Data Explorer.Azure Cosmos DB transactions can trigger Azure Functions via change feed. Functions will stream data to Event Hubs for ingestion into Azure Data Explorer.-or-Azure Functions can invoke Azure Digital Twins through its API, which then streams data to Event Hubs for ingestion into Azure Data Explorer.

Components
This solution idea uses the following Azure components:
Azure Data Exploreris a fast, fully managed, and highly scalable big data analytics service. Azure Data Explorer can analyze large volumes of streaming data from applications, websites, and IoT devices in near real-time to serve analytics applications and dashboards.
Azure Data Explorer provides native advanced analytics for:
Time series analysis.
Pattern recognition.
Anomaly detection and forecasting.
Anomaly diagnosis for root analysis.
TheAzure Data Explorer Web UIconnects to Azure Data Explorer clusters to help write, run, and share Kusto Query Language commands and queries.Azure Data Explorer Dashboardsare a feature in the Data Explorer Web UI that natively exports Kusto queries to optimized dashboards.
Azure Cosmos DBis a fully managed, fast NoSQL database service for modern app development with open APIs for any scale.
Azure Digital Twinsstores digital models of physical environments, to help create next-generation IoT solutions that model the real world.
Azure Event Hubsis a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service.
Azure IoT Hubenables bi-directional communication between IoT devices and the Azure cloud.
Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DBruns near real-time analytics over operational data in Azure Cosmos DB, without any performance or cost impact on transactional workloads. Synapse Link uses theSQL ServerlessandSpark Poolsanalytics engines from the Azure Synapse workspace.
Kafka on HDInsightis an easy, cost-effective, enterprise-grade service for open-source analytics with Apache Kafka.
