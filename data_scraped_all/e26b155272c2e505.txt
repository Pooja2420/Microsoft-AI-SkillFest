The example configurations outlined in this article are a progression of complexity based on configuration choices.  Each example has an associated configuration focused on redundancy or disaster recovery. We recommend customers select the simplest configuration for their environment. Adding unnecessary complexity leads to incorrect configurations and support cases.
Note
Use these examples as astartingpoint of your FSLogix configuration. The ideas and concepts in these examples should inform your unique organizational requirements.
EXAMPLE 1: Standard
TheStandardconfiguration example is the simplest configuration in which most customers should consider.
Prerequisites (Standard)
FSLogix prerequisites including antivirus exclusions
Azure Virtual Desktop or equivalent Virtual Desktop infrastructure.
SMB File Share.
Validatedshare and NTFS permissions.
Configuration Items (Standard)
Registry Settings (Standard)
\\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name>
1 Recommended to ensure user's don't use local profiles and lose data unexpectedly.2 Provides and easier way to browse the container directories.3 Decreases the retry timing to enable a faster fail scenario.4 Single connections reduce complexity and increase performance.5 VHDX is preferred over VHD due to its supported size and reduced corruption scenarios.
EXAMPLE 2: Standard + High Availability (Cloud Cache)
TheStandard +High Availabilityconfiguration enhances the basicStandardexample by incorporating Cloud Cache to ensure regional availability for the profile container. This configuration is designed to provide robustness and redundancy, allowing the profile container to be accessible even in the event of failures or outages in a specific region. Cloud Cache acts as a resiliency and availability layer, periodically writing profile data upstream to multiple storage providers. By replicating data across unique storage providers, it ensures that the profile container remains available even if one storage provider is unavailable. This approach enhances reliability and minimizes downtime for end-users.
Redundant and robust: Allows the profile container to be accessible even in the event of failures or outages, minimizing downtime for end-users
Resiliency: Cloud Cache acts as an availability layer, periodically writing profile data upstream to multiple storage providers.
Storage design expertise: Cloud Cache functionality is dependent on the performance of your storage providers.
The Standard + High Availability configuration combines the benefits of the Standard setup with additional measures to maintain availability across regions, making it suitable for critical applications that require continuous access to profile data.

1 Recommended to save disk space on the local disk and risk of data loss when using pooled desktops.2 Recommended to ensure user's don't use local profiles and lose data unexpectedly.3 Provides and easier way to browse the container directories.4 Prevents users from creating a local cache if at least 1 provider isn't healthy.5 Decreases the retry timing to enable a faster fail scenario.6 Single connections reduce complexity and increase performance.7 VHDX is preferred over VHD due to its supported size and reduced corruption scenarios.
EXAMPLE 3: Standard + Disaster Recovery (no profile recovery)
TheStandard +Disaster Recoveryis an extension of the basicStandard. In this setup, duplicate infrastructure exists in another region, but it remainspowered downuntil needed. Unlike other recovery scenarios, there isno profile recoveryin this approach. Instead, users create new profiles in the alternate location. While this is theleast complex recovery scenario, it comes with a significant drawback:end-user experience and trainingbecome critical components for success.
Duplicate Infrastructure: The disaster recovery region mirrors the primary infrastructure but remains inactive until required.
No Profile Recovery: Instead of restoring existing profiles, users create new ones in the alternate location.
Simplicity: This approach minimizes complexity but relies heavily on user familiarity and training.
End-User Experience: Ensuring a smooth transition and user understanding is crucial.
TheStandard + Disaster Recovery configurationbalances simplicity with the need for user education and adaptation.

EXAMPLE 4: Advanced
TheAdvancedconfiguration example builds upon theStandardexample by introducing additional features to enhance flexibility and customization.
Multiple VHDLocations or object-specific settings: You can specify multiple locations for storing user profiles (VHDLocations). Alternatively, you can define object-specific settings to tailor profile behavior for specific users or groups. This flexibility allows you to optimize profile management based on your organizationâs needs.
Minimal entries in custom profile redirections: Unlike the Standard setup, where the redirections.xml file isn't used, the Advanced configuration minimizes the number of redirections.xml entries. Each entry in the redirections.xml configuration adds complexity and can cause unknown application behaviors. Minimizing these entries may provide an overall better user experience.
The Advanced configuration provides granular control over profile storage and redirection, making it suitable for organizations with diverse requirements.

Warning
Multiple entries inVHDLocationsdoesn't provide container resiliency. When multiple entries exist, a user will try to create or locate their container from the list of locations in order. The first location which the user has access to or is available will be where the container is created or attached from. If using multiple entries, users should only have access to a single location.Consider using the object-specific configuration settings in lieu of multiple VHDLocations.

EXAMPLE 5: Advanced + Disaster Recovery (primary / failover)
TheAdvanced +Disaster Recoveryconfiguration example adds complexity through a failover design. This is a common strategy to ensure the availability and reliability of your infrastructure in case of a disaster or a failure. With Cloud Cache, you can configure your devices to use two (2) storage providers that store your profile data in different locations. Cloud Cache synchronizes your profile data to each of the two storage providers asynchronously, so you always have the latest version of your data. Some of your devices are in the primary location and the other devices are in the failover location. Cloud Cache prioritizes the first storage provider (closest to your device), and uses the other storage provider as a backup. For example, if your primary device is in West US and your failover device is in East US, you can configure Cloud Cache as follows:
The primary device uses a storage provider in West US as the first option and a storage provider in East US as the second option.
The failover device uses a storage provider in East US as the first option and a storage provider in West US as the second option.
If the primary device or the closest storage provider fails, you can switch to the failover device or the backup storage provider and continue your work without losing your profile data.
Failover design: This design ensures the availability and reliability of your infrastructure in case of a disaster or a failure.
Profile storage: Cloud Cache enables your to store your profile data in different locations.
Additional storage cost: Multiple storage locations will increase the overall cost.
Operational excellence: Manual failover process, which may require the approval of the business stakeholders and process validation.
End-user experience: You may experience some latency or inconsistency in your profile data due to the asynchronous synchronization to the two storage providers.
The Advanced + Disaster Recovery configuration shows how a failover design with Cloud Cache can enhance the reliability and availability of your infrastructure by using two storage providers in different locations. It also highlights the drawbacks of this approach, including additional costs, the need for manual failover initiation, and potential latency or inconsistency in profile data.

EXAMPLE 6: Complex
TheComplexconfiguration example builds upon theAdvancedexample by introducingmultiple connections. In this setup, user profiles can handle multiple connections, allowing a single user to have active sessions across different devices simultaneously. Despite the increased complexity, the goal remains to provide a seamless experience for end-users. Properly configured multiple connections enhance productivity and flexibility, making this configuration suitable for organizations with diverse needs and high demands.
Note
Azure Virtual Desktop does not support multiple connections within thesameHost Pool.
The Complex configuration balances sophistication with user-centric design, making it ideal for large organizations requiring scalability and robust profile management.

EXAMPLE 7: Complex + Disaster Recovery (active / active)
TheComplex +Disaster Recoveryconfiguration builds upon theAdvanced + Disaster Recoveryconfiguration by implementing an active/active design. Instead of load balancing between the two sites, this configuration relies on users having access to only one location. In the event of a drill or BCDR, users from a failed region are granted access to virtual machines in the functioning region.
Failover capability: In the event of a disaster, the surviving regions must have capacity to support all users.
Profile storage: Cloud Cache enables your to store your profile data in different locations.
Additional storage cost: Multiple storage locations will increase the overall cost.
Operational excellence: Manual failover process, which may require the approval of the business stakeholders, process validation and proper user assignments.
End-user experience: You may experience some latency or inconsistency in your profile data due to the asynchronous synchronization to the two storage providers.
The Complex + Disaster Recovery configuration with Cloud Cache provides redundancy and flexibility, but business decisions play a crucial role in initiating failover.
