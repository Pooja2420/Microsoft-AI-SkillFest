Today, Azure DevOps supports allconditional access policiesset on the Azure Active Directory tenant for web and interactive flows during initial signin. Once a user has signed in, however, only IP-fencing policies are supported on an ongoing basis. We will invest in deepening Azure DevOps' integration with Azure Active Directory such thatallconditional access policies are continuously evaluated - typically on an hourly basis. This will improve support for policies likedevice compliance, which can be used to prevent usage from devices that fail to meet a variety of compliance requirements.
Note
Non-interactive flows - for example, requests made programmatically using Personal Access Tokens - will continue to only support IP-fencing conditional access policies.
Updated web session authentication is now available on all Azure DevOps Services web pages for most modern browsers.
