If your application needs to use the D drive to store data, follow these instructions to use a different drive letter for the temporary disk. Never use the temporary disk to store data that you need to keep.
If you resize orStop (Deallocate)a virtual machine, this may trigger placement of the virtual machine to a new hypervisor. A planned or unplanned maintenance event may also trigger this placement. In this scenario, the temporary disk will be reassigned to the first available drive letter. If you have an application that specifically requires the D: drive, you need to follow these steps to temporarily move the pagefile.sys, attach a new data disk and assign it the letter D and then move the pagefile.sys back to the temporary drive. Once complete, Azure will not take back the D: if the VM moves to a different hypervisor.
For more information about how Azure uses the temporary disk, seeUnderstanding the temporary drive on Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
Attach the data disk
First, you'll need to attach the data disk to the virtual machine. To do this using the portal, seeHow to attach a managed data disk in the Azure portal.
Temporarily move pagefile.sys to C drive
Connect to the virtual machine.
Right-click theStartmenu and selectSystem.
In the left-hand menu, search for and selectView advanced system settings.

Select theCdrive and then clickSystem managed sizeand then clickSet.
Select theDdrive and then clickNo paging fileand then clickSet.
Click Apply. You will get a warning that the computer needs to be restarted for the changes to take affect.
Restart the virtual machine.
Change the drive letters
