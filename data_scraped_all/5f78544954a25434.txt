Azure offers a choice of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) options from both AMD and Intel. These TEEs allow you to create Confidential VM environments with excellent price-to-performance ratios, all without requiring any code changes.
For AMD-based Confidential VMs, the technology used isAMD SEV-SNP, which was introduced with 3rd Gen AMD EPYCâ¢ processors. On the other hand, Intel-based Confidential VMs utilizeIntel TDX, a technology introduced with 4th Gen IntelÂ® XeonÂ® processors. Both technologies have different implementations, however both provide similar protections from the cloud infrastructure stack.
Sizes
We offer the following VM sizes:
Note
Memory-optimized confidential VMs offer double the ratio of memory per vCPU count.
Azure CLI commands
You can use theAzure CLIwith your confidential VMs.
To see a list of confidential VM sizes, run the following command. Replace<vm-series>with the series you want to use. The output shows information about available regions and availability zones.
<vm-series>
vm_series='DCASv5'
az vm list-skus \
    --size dc \
    --query "[?family=='standard${vm_series}Family'].{name:name,locations:locationInfo[0].location,AZ_a:locationInfo[0].zones[0],AZ_b:locationInfo[0].zones[1],AZ_c:locationInfo[0].zones[2]}" \
    --all \
    --output table
vm_series='DCASv5'
az vm list-skus \
    --size dc \
    --query "[?family=='standard${vm_series}Family'].{name:name,locations:locationInfo[0].location,AZ_a:locationInfo[0].zones[0],AZ_b:locationInfo[0].zones[1],AZ_c:locationInfo[0].zones[2]}" \
    --all \
    --output table
For a more detailed list, run the following command instead:
vm_series='DCASv5'
az vm list-skus \
    --size dc \
    --query "[?family=='standard${vm_series}Family']"
vm_series='DCASv5'
az vm list-skus \
    --size dc \
    --query "[?family=='standard${vm_series}Family']"
Deployment considerations
Consider the following settings and choices before deploying confidential VMs.
Azure subscription
To deploy a confidential VM instance, consider apay-as-you-go subscriptionor other purchase option. If you're using anAzure free account, the quota doesn't allow the appropriate number of Azure compute cores.
You might need to increase the cores quota in your Azure subscription from the default value. Default limits vary depending on your subscription category. Your subscription might also limit the number of cores you can deploy in certain VM size families, including the confidential VM sizes.
To request a quota increase,open an online customer support request.
If you have large-scale capacity needs, contact Azure Support. Azure quotas are credit limits, not capacity guarantees. You only incur charges for cores that you use.
Pricing
For pricing options, see theLinux Virtual Machines Pricing.
Regional availability
For availability information, see whichVM products are available by Azure region.
Resizing
Confidential VMs run on specialized hardware, so you can onlyresize confidential VM instancesto other confidential sizes in the same region. For example, if you have a DCasv5-series VM, you can resize to another DCasv5-series instance or a DCesv5-series instance.
It's not possible to resize a non-confidential VM to a confidential VM.
High availability and disaster recovery
You're responsible for creating high availability and disaster recovery solutions for your confidential VMs. Planning for these scenarios helps minimize and avoid prolonged downtime.
Deployment with ARM templates
Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. You can:
Secure and organize your resources after deployment with the management features, like access control, locks, and tags.
Create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription using the management layer.
UseAzure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates)to deploy confidential VMs on AMD processors.
Make sure to specify the following properties for your VM in the parameters section (parameters):
parameters
VM size (vmSize). Choose from the differentconfidential VM families and sizes.
vmSize
OS image name (osImageName). Choose from the qualified OS images.
osImageName
Disk encryption type (securityType). Choose from VMGS-only encryption (VMGuestStateOnly) or full OS disk pre-encryption (DiskWithVMGuestState), which might result in longer provisioning times. For Intel TDX instances only we also support another security type (NonPersistedTPM) which has no VMGS or OS disk encryption.
securityType
VMGuestStateOnly
DiskWithVMGuestState
