Filters a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a predicate.
Thewhereandfilteroperators are equivalent
where
filter
Syntax
T| wherePredicate
| where

Parameters
string
string
Returns
Rows inTfor whichPredicateistrue.
true
Note
All filtering functions return false when compared with null values. Use special null-aware functions to write queries that handle null values.
isnull()
isnotnull()
isempty()
isnotempty()
Performance tips
Use simple comparisonsbetween column names and constants. ('Constant' means constant over the table - sonow()andago()are OK, and so are scalar values assigned using aletstatement.)For example, preferwhere Timestamp >= ago(1d)towhere bin(Timestamp, 1d) == ago(1d).

now()
ago()
let
For example, preferwhere Timestamp >= ago(1d)towhere bin(Timestamp, 1d) == ago(1d).
where Timestamp >= ago(1d)
where bin(Timestamp, 1d) == ago(1d)
Simplest terms first: If you have multiple clauses conjoined withand, put first the clauses that involve just one column. SoTimestamp > ago(1d) and OpId == EventIdis better than the other way around.

Examples
Order comparisons by complexity
The following query returns storm records that report damaged property, are floods, and start and end in different places.
Notice that we put the comparison between two columns last, as the where operator can't use the index and forces a scan.
Run the query
StormEvents
| project DamageProperty, EventType, BeginLocation, EndLocation
| where DamageProperty > 0
    and EventType == "Flood"
    and BeginLocation != EndLocation
StormEvents
| project DamageProperty, EventType, BeginLocation, EndLocation
| where DamageProperty > 0
    and EventType == "Flood"
    and BeginLocation != EndLocation
The following table only shows the top 10 results. To see the full output, run the query.
Check if column contains string
The following query returns the rows in which the word "cow" appears in any column.
Run the query
StormEvents
| where * has "cow"
StormEvents
| where * has "cow"
