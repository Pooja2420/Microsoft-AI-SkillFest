Sizing a cluster appropriately is critical to the performance of Azure Data Explorer. A static cluster size can lead to underutilization or overutilization, neither of which is ideal. Because demand on a cluster can't be predicted with absolute accuracy, it's better toscalea cluster, adding and removing capacity and CPU resources with changing demand.
There are two workflows for scaling an Azure Data Explorer cluster:
Horizontal scaling, also called scaling in and out.
Vertical scaling, also called scaling up and down.
This article explains the horizontal scaling workflow.
Configure horizontal scaling
By using horizontal scaling, you can scale the instance count automatically, based on predefined rules and schedules. To specify the autoscale settings for your cluster:
In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Data Explorer cluster resource. UnderSettings, selectScale out.
In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Data Explorer cluster resource. UnderSettings, selectScale out.
In theScale outwindow, select the autoscale method that you want:Manual scale,Optimized autoscale, orCustom autoscale.
In theScale outwindow, select the autoscale method that you want:Manual scale,Optimized autoscale, orCustom autoscale.
Manual scale
In the manual scale option, the cluster has a static capacity that doesn't change automatically. Select the static capacity by using theInstance countbar. The cluster's scaling remains at the selected setting until changed.

Optimized autoscale (recommended option)
Optimized autoscale is the default setting during cluster creation and the recommended scaling method. This method optimizes cluster performance and cost, as follows:
If the cluster is underutilized, it is scaled in to lower cost without affecting the required performance.
If the cluster is overutilized, it is scaled out to maintain optimal performance.
To configure optimized autoscale:
SelectOptimized autoscale.
SelectOptimized autoscale.
Specify a minimum and maximum instance count. The cluster autoscaling ranges between these values based on load.

SelectSave.
SelectSave.

Optimized autoscale starts working. Its actions can be viewed in the cluster's activity log in Azure.
Optimized autoscale is managed by either predictive or reactive logic.
Predictive logic tracks the usage pattern of the cluster and when it identifies seasonality with high confidence, it manages the cluster's scaling.
Otherwise, reactive logic that tracks the actual usage of the cluster is used to make decisions on cluster scale operations based on the current level of resource usage.
The main metrics for both predictive and reactive flows are:
CPU
Cache utilization factor
Ingestion utilization
Both predictive and reactive logic are bound to the cluster's size boundaries, the min and max number of instances, as defined in the optimized autoscale configuration.
Frequent clusterscale outandscale inoperations are undesirable because of the impact on the cluster's resources and the required time for adding or removing instances, as well as rebalancing the hot cache across all nodes.
Predictive logic forecasts the cluster's usage for the next day based on its usage pattern over the last few weeks. The forecast is used to create a schedule ofscale inorscale outoperations to adjust the cluster's size ahead of time. This allows the cluster scaling and data rebalancing to complete in time for when the load changes. This logic is especially effective for seasonal patterns, such as daily or weekly usage spikes.
However, in scenarios where there is a unique spike in usage that exceeds the forecast, optimized autoscale will fall back on reactive logic. When this happens,scale inorscale outoperations are performed ad hoc based on the latest level of resource usage.
Scale out
When the cluster approaches a state of overutilization, ascale outoperation will take place to maintain optimal performance. Ascale outoperation is performed when at least one of the following conditions occurs:
The cache utilization is high for over an hour
The CPU is high for over an hour
The ingestion utilization is high for over an hour
Scale in
When the cluster is underutilized, ascale inoperation will take place to lower cost while maintaining optimal performance. Multiple metrics are used to verify that it's safe toscale inthe cluster.
To ensure that there's no overloading of resources, the following metrics are evaluated beforescale inis performed:
Cache utilization isn't high
CPU is below average
Ingestion utilization is below average
If streaming ingest is used, streaming ingest utilization isn't high
Keep alive metric is above a defined minimum, processed properly, and on time indicating that the cluster is responsive
There is no query throttling
Number of failed queries are below a defined minimum
Note
Thescale inlogic requires a 1-day evaluation before implementation of optimizedscale in. This evaluation takes place once every hour. If an immediate change is needed, usemanual scale.
Custom autoscale
Althoughoptimized autoscaleis the recommended scaling option, Azure custom autoscale is also supported. By using custom autoscale, you can scale your cluster dynamically based on metrics that you specify. Use the following steps to configure custom autoscale.

In theAutoscale setting namebox, enter a name, such asScale-out: cache utilization.
In theAutoscale setting namebox, enter a name, such asScale-out: cache utilization.
ForScale mode, selectScale based on a metric. This mode provides dynamic scaling. You can also selectScale to a specific instance count.
