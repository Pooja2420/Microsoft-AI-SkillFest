As datasets get larger, finding a specific object in a sea of data can be difficult. Blob index tags provide data management and discovery capabilities by using key-value index tag attributes. You can categorize and find objects within a single container or across all containers in your storage account. As data requirements change, objects can be dynamically categorized by updating their index tags. Objects can remain in-place with their current container organization.

Consider a scenario where you have millions of blobs in your storage account, accessed by many different applications. You want to find all related data from a single project. You aren't sure what's in scope as the data can be spread across multiple containers with different naming conventions. However, your applications upload all data with tags based on their project. Instead of searching through millions of blobs and comparing names and properties, you can useProject = Contosoas your discovery criteria. Blob index will filter all containers across your entire storage account to quickly find and return just the set of 50 blobs fromProject = Contoso.
Project = Contoso
Project = Contoso
To get started with examples on how to use blob index, seeUse blob index tags to manage and find data.
Blob index tags and data management
Container and blob name prefixes are one-dimensional categorizations. Blob index tags allow for multi-dimensional categorization forblob data types (Block, Append, or Page). Multi-dimensional categorization is natively indexed by Azure Blob Storage so you can quickly find your data.
Consider the following five blobs in your storage account:
container1/transaction.csv
container1/transaction.csv
container2/campaign.docx
container2/campaign.docx
photos/bannerphoto.png
photos/bannerphoto.png
archives/completed/2019review.pdf
archives/completed/2019review.pdf
logs/2020/01/01/logfile.txt
logs/2020/01/01/logfile.txt
These blobs are separated using a prefix ofcontainer/virtual folder/blob name. You can set an index tag attribute ofProject = Contosoon these five blobs to categorize them together while maintaining their current prefix organization. Adding index tags eliminates the need to move data by exposing the ability to filter and find data using the index.
Project = Contoso
Setting blob index tags
Blob index tags are key-value attributes that can be applied to new or existing objects within your storage account. You can specify index tags during the upload process usingPut Blob,Put Block List, orCopy Bloboperations and the optionalx-ms-tagsheader. If you already have blobs in your storage account, callSet Blob Tagspassing a formatted XML document with the index tags in the body of the request.
x-ms-tags
Important
Setting blob index tags can be performed by theStorage Blob Data Ownerand by anyone with a Shared Access Signature that has permission to access the blob's tags (thetSAS permission).
t
In addition, RBAC users with theMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/tags/writepermission can perform this operation.
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/tags/write
You can apply a single tag on your blob to describe when your data was finished processing.
"processedDate" = '2020-01-01'
You can apply multiple tags on your blob to be more descriptive of the data.
"Project" = 'Contoso'
"Classified" = 'True'
"Status" = 'Unprocessed'
"Priority" = '01'
To modify the existing index tag attributes, retrieve the existing tag attributes, modify the tag attributes, and replace with theSet Blob Tagsoperation. To remove all index tags from the blob, call theSet Blob Tagsoperation with no tag attributes specified. As blob index tags are a subresource to the blob data contents,Set Blob Tagsdoesn't modify any underlying content and doesn't change the blob's last-modified-time or eTag. You can create or modify index tags for all current base blobs. Index tags are also preserved for previous versions but they aren't passed to the blob index engine, so you cannot query index tags to retrieve previous versions. Tags on soft-deleted blobs cannot be modified.

Tip
You can use astorage taskto set tags on objects at scale across multiple storage accounts based on a set of conditions that you define. A storage task is a resource available inAzure Storage Actions; a serverless framework that you can use to perform common data operations on millions of objects across multiple storage accounts. To learn more, seeWhat is Azure Storage Actions?.
Getting and listing blob index tags
Blob index tags are stored as a subresource alongside the blob data and can be retrieved independently from the underlying blob data content. Blob index tags for a single blob can be retrieved with theGet Blob Tagsoperation. TheList Blobsoperation with theinclude:tagsparameter will also return all blobs within a container along with their blob index tags.
include:tags

Getting and listing blob index tags can be performed by theStorage Blob Data Ownerand by anyone with a Shared Access Signature that has permission to access the blob's tags (thetSAS permission).

In addition, RBAC users with theMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/tags/readpermission can perform this operation.
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/tags/read
For any blobs with at least one blob index tag, thex-ms-tag-countis returned in theList Blobs,Get Blob, andGet Blob Propertiesoperations indicating the count of index tags on the blob.
x-ms-tag-count
Finding data using blob index tags
The indexing engine exposes your key-value attributes into a multi-dimensional index. After you set your index tags, they exist on the blob and can be retrieved immediately.
It might take some time before the blob index updates. This is true for both adding tags and editing existing ones. The amount of time required depends on the workload. For example, if aSet Blob Tagsoperation takes 30 minutes to complete at a rate of 15000 to 20000 transactions per second, then it can take up to 10 minutes to index all of those blobs. At a lower rate, the indexing delay can be under a second. The distribution of traffic also affects indexing delays. For example, if a client application sets tags on blobs in sequential order under the same container, the delay could be higher than it would be if tags are applied to blobs that aren't located together.
After the blob index updates, you can use the native query and discovery capabilities offered by Blob Storage.
TheFind Blobs by Tagsoperation enables you to get a filtered set of blobs whose index tags match a given query expression.Find Blobs by Tagssupports filtering across all containers within your storage account or you can scope the filtering to just a single container. Since all the index tag keys and values are strings, relational operators use a lexicographic sorting.

In addition, RBAC users with theMicrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/filter/actionpermission can perform this operation.
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/filter/action
The following criteria applies to blob index filtering:
Tag keys should be enclosed in double quotes (")
Tag keys should be enclosed in double quotes (")
Tag values and container names should be enclosed in single quotes (')
Tag values and container names should be enclosed in single quotes (')
The @ character is only allowed for filtering on a specific container name (for example,@container = 'ContainerName')

Tag queries are optimized for equality match using a single tag (e.g. StoreID = "100").  Range queries using a single tag involving >, >=, <, <= are also efficient. Any query using AND with more than one tag will not be as efficient.  For example, Cost > "01" AND Cost <= "100" is efficient. Cost > "01 AND StoreID = "2" is not as efficient.

Any query using AND with more than one tag will not be as efficient.  For example, Cost > "01" AND Cost <= "100" is efficient. Cost > "01 AND StoreID = "2" is not as efficient.
The below table shows all the valid operators forFind Blobs by Tags:
Find Blobs by Tags
"Status" = 'In Progress'
"Date" > '2018-06-18'
"Priority" >= '5'
"Age" < '32'
"Priority" <= '5'
"Rank" >= '010' AND "Rank" < '100'
@container = 'videofiles' AND "status" = 'done'
Note
Be familiar with lexicographical ordering when setting and querying on tags.
Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit.
Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters.
Symbols aren't standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters.
Conditional blob operations with blob index tags
In REST versions 2019-10-10 and higher, mostblob service APIsnow support a conditional header,x-ms-if-tags, such that the operation will only succeed if the specified blob index condition is met. If the condition isn't met, you'll geterror 412: The condition specified using HTTP conditional header(s) is not met.
x-ms-if-tags
error 412: The condition specified using HTTP conditional header(s) is not met
Thex-ms-if-tagsheader may be combined with the other existing HTTP conditional headers (If-Match, If-None-Match, and so on). If multiple conditional headers are provided in a request, they all must evaluate true for the operation to succeed. All conditional headers are effectively combined with logical AND.
x-ms-if-tags
The below table shows the valid operators for conditional operations:
"Status" = 'In Progress'
"Status" <> 'Done'
"Date" > '2018-06-18'
"Priority" >= '5'
"Age" < '32'
"Priority" <= '5'
"Rank" >= '010' AND "Rank" < '100'
"Status" = 'Done' OR "Priority" >= '05'
Note
There are two additional operators, not equal and logical or, that are allowed in the conditionalx-ms-if-tagsheader for blob operations but do not exist in theFind Blobs by Tagsoperation.

Platform integrations with blob index tags
Blob index tags not only help you categorize, manage, and search on your blob data, but also provide integration with other Blob Storage features, such aslifecycle management.
Lifecycle management
Using theblobIndexMatchas a rule filter in lifecycle management, you can move data to cooler tiers or delete data based on the index tags applied to your blobs. You can be more granular in your rules and only move or delete blobs if they match the specified tags criteria.
blobIndexMatch
You can set a blob index match as a standalone filter set in a lifecycle rule to apply actions on tagged data. Or you can combine both a prefix and a blob index to match more specific data sets. Specifying multiple filters in a lifecycle rule applies a logical AND operation. The action will only apply ifallfilter criteria match.
The following sample lifecycle management rule applies to block blobs in a container calledvideofiles. The rule tiers blobs to archive storage only if the data matches the blob index tag criteria of"Status" == 'Processed' AND "Source" == 'RAW'.
videofiles
"Status" == 'Processed' AND "Source" == 'RAW'

Blob index tags are a subresource to the blob data. A user with permissions or a SAS token to read or write blobs may not have access to the blob index tags.
Role-based access control
Callers using anMicrosoft Entra identitymay be granted the following permissions to operate on blob index tags.
Additional permissions, separate from the underlying blob data, are required for index tag operations. TheStorage Blob Data Ownerrole is granted permissions for all three blob index tag operations.
SAS permissions
Callers using ashared access signature (SAS)may be granted scoped permissions to operate on blob index tags.
The following permissions may be granted in a service SAS for a blob to allow access to blob index tags. The blob read (r) and write (w) permissions alone aren't enough to allow reading or writing its index tags.

Choosing between metadata and blob index tags
Both blob index tags and metadata provide the ability to store arbitrary user-defined key-value properties alongside a blob resource. Both can be retrieved and set directly, without returning or altering the contents of the blob. It's possible to use both metadata and index tags.
Only index tags are automatically indexed and made searchable by the native Blob Storage service. Metadata can't be natively indexed or searched. You must use a separate service such asAzure Search. Blob index tags have additional permissions for reading, filtering, and writing that are separate from the underlying blob data. Metadata uses the same permissions as the blob and is returned as HTTP headers by theGet BlobandGet Blob Propertiesoperations. Blob index tags are encrypted at rest using aMicrosoft-managed key. Metadata is encrypted at rest using the same encryption key specified for blob data.
The following table summarizes the differences between metadata and blob index tags:

List Blobs
Pricing
You're charged for the monthly average number of index tags within a storage account. There's no cost for the indexing engine. Requests to Set Blob Tags, Get Blob Tags, and Find Blob Tags are charged at the current respective transaction rates. Note that the number of list transactions consumed when doing a Find Blobs by Tag transaction is equal to the number of clauses in the request. For example, the query (StoreID = 100) is one list transaction.  The query (StoreID = 100 AND SKU = 10010) is two list transactions. SeeBlock Blob pricing to learn more.

Feature support
Support for this feature might be impacted by enabling Data Lake Storage Gen2, Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol, or the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). If you've enabled any of these capabilities, seeBlob Storage feature support in Azure Storage accountsto assess support for this feature.

If Blob storage versioning is enabled, you can still use index tags on the current version. Index tags are preserved for previous versions, but those tags aren't passed to the blob index engine, so you cannot use them to retrieve previous versions. If you promote a previous version to the current version, then the tags of that previous version become the tags of the current version. Because those tags are associated with the current version, they are passed to the blob index engine and you can query them.
