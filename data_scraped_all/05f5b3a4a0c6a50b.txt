In this article
Learn how to centrally manage multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces within one or more Azure tenants with workspace manager. This article takes you through provisioning and usage of workspace manager. Whether you're a global enterprise or a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP), workspace manager helps you operate at scale efficiently.
Here are the active content types supported with workspace manager:
Analytics rules
Automation rules (excluding Playbooks)
Parsers, Saved Searches and Functions
Hunting and Livestream queries
Workbooks
Important
Support for workspace manager is currently in PREVIEW. TheAzure Preview Supplemental Termsinclude additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
If you onboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Microsoft Defender portal, seeMicrosoft Defender multitenant management.
Prerequisites
You need at least two Microsoft Sentinel workspaces. One workspace to manage from and at least one other workspace to be managed.
TheMicrosoft Sentinel Contributor role assignmentis required on the central workspace (where workspace manager is enabled on), and on the member workspace(s) the contributor needs to manage. To learn more about roles in Microsoft Sentinel, seeRoles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel.
Enable Azure Lighthouse if you're managing workspaces across multiple Microsoft Entra tenants. To learn more, seeManage Microsoft Sentinel workspaces at scale.
Considerations
Configure a central workspace to be the environment where you consolidate content items and configurations to be published at scale to member workspaces. Create a new Microsoft Sentinel workspace or utilize an existing one to serve as the central workspace.
Depending on your scenario, consider these architectures:
Direct-linkis the least complex setup. Control all member workspaces with only one central workspace.
Co-Managementsupports scenarios where more than one central workspace needs to manage a member workspace. For example, workspaces simultaneously managed by an in-house SOC team and an MSSP.
N-Tiersupports complex scenarios where a central workspace controls another central workspace. For example, a conglomerate that manages multiple subsidiaries, where each subsidiary also manages multiple workspaces.

Enable workspace manager on the central workspace
Enable the central workspace once you have decided which Microsoft Sentinel workspace should be the workspace manager.
Navigate to theSettingsblade in the parent workspace, and toggleOnthe workspace manager configuration setting to "Make this workspace a parent".

Onboard member workspaces
Member workspaces are the set of workspaces managed by workspace manager. Onboard some or all of the workspaces in the tenant, and across multiple tenants as well (if Azure Lighthouse is enabled).
Navigate to workspace manager and select "Add workspaces"
Select the member workspace(s) you would like to onboard to workspace manager.
Once successfully onboarded, theMemberscount increases and your member workspaces are reflected in theWorkspacestab.
Create a group
Workspace manager groups allow you to organize workspaces together based on business groups, verticals, geography, etc. Use groups to pair content items relevant to the workspaces.
Tip
Make sure you have at least one active content item deployed in the central workspace. This allows you to select content items from the central workspace to be published in the member workspace(s) in the subsequent steps.
To create a group:To add one workspace, selectAdd>Group.To add multiple workspaces, select the workspaces andAdd>Group from selected.
To create a group:
To add one workspace, selectAdd>Group.
To add multiple workspaces, select the workspaces andAdd>Group from selected.
On theCreate or update grouppage, enter aNameandDescriptionfor the group.

In theSelect workspacestab, selectAddand select the member workspaces that you would like to add to the group.
In theSelect workspacestab, selectAddand select the member workspaces that you would like to add to the group.
In theSelect contenttab, you have 2 ways to add content items.Method 1: Select theAddmenu and chooseAll content. All active content currently deployed in the central workspace is added. This list is a point-in-time snapshot that selects only active content, not templates.Method 2: Select theAddmenu and chooseContent. ASelect contentwindow opens to custom select the content added.

Publish the Group definition
At this point, the content items selected haven't been published to the member workspace(s) yet.
Note
The publish action will fail if themaximum publish operationsare exceeded.
Consider splitting up member workspaces into additional groups if you approach this limit.
Select the group >Publish content.To bulk publish, multi-select the desired groups and selectPublish.
Select the group >Publish content.

To bulk publish, multi-select the desired groups and selectPublish.

If successful, theLast publish statusupdates to reflectSucceeded. The selected content items now exist in the member workspaces.If just one content item fails to publish for the entire group, theLast publish statusupdates to reflectFailed.

Troubleshooting
Each publish attempt has a link to help with troubleshooting if content items fail to publish.
Select theFailedhyperlink to open the job failure details window. A status for each content item and target workspace pair is displayed.

Filter theStatusfor failed item pairs.

Common reasons for failure include:
Content items referenced in the group definition no longer exist at the time of publish (have been deleted).
Permissions have changed at the time of publish. For example, the user is no longer a Microsoft Sentinel Contributor or doesn't have sufficient permissions on the member workspace anymore.
A member workspace has been deleted.
Known limitations
The maximum published operations per group is 2000.Published operations= (member workspaces) * (content items).For example, if you have 10 member workspaces in a group and you publish 20 content items in that group,published operations=10*20=200.
Playbooks attributed or attached to analytics and automation rules aren't currently supported.
Workbooks stored in bring-your-own-storage aren't currently supported.
Workspace manager only manages content items published from the central workspace. It doesn't manage content created locally from member workspace(s).
Currently, deleting content residing in member workspace(s) centrally via workspace manager isn't supported.
