In this article
In this article, you learn how to set up event-driven applications, processes, or CI/CD workflows based on Azure Machine Learning events. For example, failure notification emails or ML pipeline runs, when certain conditions are detected usingAzure Event Grid.
Azure Machine Learning manages the entire lifecycle of machine learning process, including model training, model deployment, and monitoring. You can use Event Grid to react to Azure Machine Learning events, such as the completion of training runs, the registration and deployment of models, and the detection of data drift, by using modern serverless architectures. You can then subscribe and consume events such as run status changed, run completion, model registration, model deployment, and data drift detection within a workspace.
When to use Event Grid for event driven actions:
Send emails on run failure and run completion
Use an Azure function after a model is registered
Streaming events from Azure Machine Learning to various of endpoints
Trigger an ML pipeline when drift is detected

Prerequisites
To use Event Grid, you need contributor or owner access to the Azure Machine Learning workspace you create events for.
The event model & types
Azure Event Grid reads events from sources, such as Azure Machine Learning and other Azure services. These events are then sent to event handlers such as Azure Event Hubs, Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and others. The following diagram shows how Event Grid connects sources and handlers, but isn't a comprehensive list of supported integrations.

For more information on event sources and event handlers, seeWhat is Event Grid?
Event types for Azure Machine Learning
Azure Machine Learning provides events in the various points of machine learning lifecycle:
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.RunCompleted
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.ModelRegistered
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.ModelDeployed
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.DatasetDriftDetected
Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.RunStatusChanged
Filter & subscribe to events
These events are published through Azure Event Grid. From the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI, you can easily subscribe to events byspecifying one or more event types, and filtering conditions.
When setting up your events, you can apply filters to only trigger on specific event data. In the following example, for run status changed events, you can filter by run types. The event only triggers when the criteria are met. For more information on the event data you can filter on, see theAzure Machine Learning Event Grid schema.
Subscriptions for Azure Machine Learning events are protected by Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). Onlycontributor or ownerof a workspace can create, update, and delete event subscriptions. Filters can be applied to event subscriptions either during thecreationof the event subscription or at a later time.
Go to the Azure portal, select a new subscription or an existing one.

Consume Machine Learning events
Applications that handle Machine Learning events should follow a few recommended practices:
As multiple subscriptions can be configured to route events to the same event handler, it is important not to assume events are from a particular source, but to check the topic of the message to ensure that it comes from the machine learning workspace you are expecting.
Similarly, check that the eventType is one you are prepared to process, and do not assume that all events you receive will be the types you expect.
As messages can arrive out of order and after some delay, use the etag fields to understand if your information about objects is still up-to-date.  Also, use the sequencer fields to understand the order of events on any particular object.
Ignore fields you don't understand. This practice will help keep you resilient to new features that might be added in the future.
Failed or cancelled Azure Machine Learning operations will not trigger an event. For example, if a model deployment fails Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.ModelDeployed won't be triggered. Consider such failure mode when design your applications. You can always use Azure Machine Learning SDK, CLI or portal to check the status of an operation and understand the detailed failure reasons.
Azure Event Grid allows customers to build decoupled message handlers, which can be triggered by Azure Machine Learning events. Some notable examples of message handlers are:
Azure Functions
Azure Logic Apps
Azure Event Hubs
Azure Data Factory Pipeline
Generic webhooks, which might be hosted on the Azure platform or elsewhere

Once you confirm your selection, selectCreate. After configuration, these events will be pushed to your endpoint.
Set up with the CLI
You can either install the latestAzure CLI, or use the Azure Cloud Shell that is provided as part of your Azure subscription.
To install the Event Grid extension, use the following command from the CLI:
az extension add --name eventgrid
az extension add --name eventgrid
The following example demonstrates how to select an Azure subscription and creates e a new event subscription for Azure Machine Learning:
# Select the Azure subscription that contains the workspace
az account set --subscription "<name or ID of the subscription>"

# Subscribe to the machine learning workspace. This example uses EventHub as a destination. 
az eventgrid event-subscription create --name {eventGridFilterName} \
  --source-resource-id /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{wsName} \
  --endpoint-type eventhub \
  --endpoint /subscriptions/{SubID}/resourceGroups/TestRG/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/n1/eventhubs/EH1 \
  --included-event-types Microsoft.MachineLearningServices.ModelRegistered \
  --subject-begins-with "models/mymodelname"
# Select the Azure subscription that contains the workspace
az account set --subscription "<name or ID of the subscription>"

# Subscribe to the machine learning workspace. This example uses EventHub as a destination. 
az eventgrid event-subscription create --name {eventGridFilterName} \
  --source-resource-id /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{wsName} \

Example: Data drift triggers retraining
Important
This example relies on a feature (data drift) that is only available when using Azure Machine Learning SDK v1 or Azure CLI extension v1 for Azure Machine Learning. For more information, seeWhat is Azure Machine Learning CLI & SDK v2.
Important
This article provides information on using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1. The SDK v1 is deprecated as of March 31, 2025 and support for it will end on June 30, 2026. You're able to install and use the SDK v1 until that date.
We recommend that you transition to the SDK v2 before June 30, 2026. For more information on the SDK v2, seeWhat is the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2and theSDK v2 reference.
Important
Some of the Azure CLI commands in this article use theazure-cli-ml, or v1, extension for Azure Machine Learning. Support for the v1 extension will end on September 30, 2025. You're able to install and use the v1 extension until that date.

We recommend that you transition to theml, or v2, extension before September 30, 2025. For more information on the v2 extension, seeAzure Machine Learning CLI extension and Python SDK v2.

Models go stale over time, and not remain useful in the context it's running in. One way to tell if it's time to retrain the model is detecting data drift.
This example shows how to use Event Grid with an Azure Logic App to trigger retraining. The example triggers an Azure Data Factory pipeline when data drift occurs between a model's training and serving datasets.
Before you begin, perform the following actions:
Set up a dataset monitor todetect data drift (SDK/CLI v1)in a workspace
Create a publishedAzure Data Factory pipeline.
In this example, a simple Data Factory pipeline is used to copy files into a blob store and run a published Machine Learning pipeline. For more information on this scenario, see how to set up aMachine Learning step in Azure Data Factory.

Start with creating the logic app. Go to theAzure portal, search for Logic Apps, and select create.
