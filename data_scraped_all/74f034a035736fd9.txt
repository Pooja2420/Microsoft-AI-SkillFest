Azure Storage offers a variety of storage options for your data. This article provides considerations to help you choose the appropriate access tier so that you can balance cost and performance. It also describes the lifecycle management of Storage, including features and best practices to help you use the access tiers effectively.
Lifecycle management
Azure Storage offers various access tiers that you can use to store blob object data. Choose the tier that best suits your workload to optimize cost.
Use ahot tierto store frequently accessed data.
Use ahot tierto store frequently accessed data.
Use acool tierto store infrequently accessed data. This tier stores data for at least 30 days.
Use acool tierto store infrequently accessed data. This tier stores data for at least 30 days.
Use acold tierto store infrequently accessed or modified data. This tier stores data for at least 90 days. The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.

Use anarchive tierto store rarely accessed data. This tier stores data for at least 180 days. Access to this data can have flexible latency requirements, which means that it can take hours to retrieve data.

Important
The online access tiers (hot, cool, and cold) don't have reliability, security, operational excellence, or performance efficiency trade-offs. Therefore, you should base your decision on the cost for each blob. Consider your workload access data size, operational interactions, and the time before the blob is deleted.Select the appropriate tierfor each blob based on these factors. For more information, seePlan and manage costs for Azure Blob Storage.
Consider the following factors when you use access tiers:
Set only the hot and cool access tiers at the account level. The account level doesn't support the archive access tier.

Set the hot, cool, and archive tiers at the blob level during upload or after upload.

Data in the cool and cold tiers has slightly lower availability, but these tiers offer features that are similar to those of the hot tier, such as high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput. For data in the cool or cold tiers, lower availability and higher access costs are acceptable trade-offs for reduced storage costs compared to the hot tier.

Archive storage stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs. But it also incurs the highest data rehydration and access costs.

Important
For cloud-scale analytics, use a custom microservice to implementlifecycle management. Carefully consider the impact of moving user-discoverable data to cool storage. Move sections of your data lake to the cool tier only for well-understood workloads.
Data lake connectivity
Each data lake should use private endpoints that you integrate into the virtual network of your data landing zone. To provide access across landing zones, connect your data landing zones through virtual network peering. This connection provides an optimal solution from both a cost and access-control perspective.
For more information, seePrivate endpointsandData management landing zone to data landing zone.
Important
A data landing zone can access data in a different data landing zone via virtual network peering. Private endpoints establish the connection associated with each data lake account. We recommend that you turn off all public access to your lakes and use private endpoints. Your platform operations team should control network connectivity across your data landing zones.
Soft delete for containers
Soft delete for containers helps protect your data from accidental or malicious deletion. If you enable container soft delete for your storage account, Storage retains deleted containers and their contents for a specified length of time. During the data-retention period, you can restore previously deleted containers. This action also restores blobs that were in that container when it was deleted.
Enable the following data-protection features to enhance end-to-end blob data protection:
Use container soft delete to restore a deleted container. For more information, seeEnable and manage soft delete for containers.
Use container soft delete to restore a deleted container. For more information, seeEnable and manage soft delete for containers.
Use blob soft delete to restore a deleted blob or version. For more information, seeEnable and manage soft delete for blobs.
Use blob soft delete to restore a deleted blob or version. For more information, seeEnable and manage soft delete for blobs.
Warning
After you delete a storage account, you can't undo the deletion. Container soft delete doesn't protect against storage account deletion, only against the deletion of containers within an account. To protect a storage account from deletion, configure a lock on the storage account resource. For more information, seeLock resources to prevent unexpected changes.
Monitoring
In a data landing zone, send all monitoring to yourAzure landing zone management subscriptionfor analysis.
For more information, seeMonitor Azure resources with Azure MonitorandMonitor Blob Storage.
Log entries are created only for requests against the service endpoint. The following types of authenticated requests are logged:
Successful requests
Failed requests, including timeouts, throttling, network problems, authorization problems, and other errors
Requests that use a shared access signature (SAS) or OAuth, including failed and successful requests
Requests to analytics data, like classic log data in the$logscontainer and class metric data in the$metrictables
$logs
$metric
Requests made by the storage service itself, like log creation or deletion, aren't logged. The following types of anonymous requests are logged:
Successful requests
Server errors
Time out errors for both client and server
Failed HTTP GET requests that have the error code 304 (Not Modified)
Not Modified
Other failed anonymous requests aren't logged.
Important
Set your default monitoring policy to audit storage and send logs to your enterprise-scale management subscription.
Data lake zone security
We recommend the following security patterns for data lake zones:
Raw usageallows access to data by using security principal names (SPNs) only. We recommend that you use managed identities.

Enriched usageallows access to data by using SPNs only. We recommend that you use managed identities.
