You can change the size of a capacity pool or a volume as necessary, for example, when a volume or capacity pool fills up.
For information about monitoring a volumeâs capacity, seeMonitor the capacity of a volume.
Considerations
Resize operations on Azure NetApp Files volumes don't result in data loss.
Volume quotas are indexed againstmaxfileslimits. Once a volume has surpassed amaxfileslimit, you cannot reduce the volume size below the quota that corresponds to thatmaxfileslimit. For more information and specific limits, seemaxfileslimits.

Capacity pools with Basic network features have a minimum size of 4 TiB. For capacity pools with Standard network features, the minimum size is 1 TiB. For more information, seeResource limits
Volume resize operations are nearly instantaneous but not always immediate. There can be a short delay for the volume's updated size to appear in the portal. Verify the size from a host perspective before re-attempting the resize operation.
Important
If you are using a capacity pool with a size of 2 TiB or smaller and have theANFStdToBasicNetworkFeaturesRevertandANFBasicToStdNetworkFeaturesUpgradeAFECs enabled and want to change the capacity pool's QoS type from auto to manual, you mustperform the operation with the REST APIusing the2023-07-01API version or later.

Resize the capacity pool using the Azure portal
You can change the capacity pool size in 1-TiB increments or decrements. However, the capacity pool size cannot be smaller than the sum of the capacity of the volumes hosted in the pool.
Resizing the capacity pool changes the purchased Azure NetApp Files capacity.
From the NetApp Account view, go toCapacity pools, and select the capacity pool that you want to resize.
From the NetApp Account view, go toCapacity pools, and select the capacity pool that you want to resize.
Right-click the capacity pool name or select the "â¦" icon at the end of the capacity pool row to display the context menu. SelectResize.
Right-click the capacity pool name or select the "â¦" icon at the end of the capacity pool row to display the context menu. SelectResize.

In the Resize pool window, specify the pool size. SelectOK.
In the Resize pool window, specify the pool size. SelectOK.

Resize a volume using the Azure portal
You can change the size of a volume as necessary. A volume's capacity consumption counts against its pool's provisioned capacity.
From the NetApp Account view, go toVolumes, and select the volume that you want to resize.
From the NetApp Account view, go toVolumes, and select the volume that you want to resize.
Right-click the volume name or select the "â¦" icon at the end of the volume's row to display the context menu. SelectResize.
Right-click the volume name or select the "â¦" icon at the end of the volume's row to display the context menu. SelectResize.

In the Update volume quota window, specify the quota for the volume. SelectOK.
In the Update volume quota window, specify the quota for the volume. SelectOK.

Resizing the capacity pool or a volume using Azure CLI
You can use the following commands of theAzure command line (CLI) toolsto resize a capacity pool or a volume:
az netappfiles pool
az netappfiles pool
az netappfiles volume(use the--usage-thresholdparameter)
az netappfiles volume
--usage-threshold
Resizing the capacity pool or a volume using REST API
You can build automation to handle the capacity pool and volume size change.
SeeREST API for Azure NetApp FilesandREST API using PowerShell for Azure NetApp Files.
The REST API specification and example code for Azure NetApp Files are available through theresource-manager GitHub directory. Seethis commandfor a sample volume update.
Resize a cross-region replication destination volume
In across-region replicationrelationship, a destination volume is automatically resized based on the size of the source volume. As such, you donât need to resize the destination volume separately. This automatic resizing behavior is applicable when the volumes are in an active replication relationship, or when replication peering is broken with theresync operation.
The following table describes the destination volume resizing behavior based on theMirror state:
Important
Ensure that you have enough headroom in the capacity pools for both the source and the destination volumes of cross-region replication. When you resize the source volume, the destination volume is automatically resized. But if the capacity pool hosting the destination volume doesnât have enough headroom, the resizing of both the source and the destination volumes will fail.
