When your Azure DevOps Server hosts multiple projects, you
can manage them more efficiently by grouping them together and assigning
the same resources to them. For example, you can group projects that
have similar requirements or objectives, such as all projects that
access a particular code base. You can then manage the group of team
projects as an autonomous resource with its own user groups, server
resources, and maintenance schedule.
A group of projects is called aproject collection. When you install Azure DevOps Server, a default collection is
created to contain all projects. When you create a collection, you
specify the logical and physical resources that projects within
that collection can use. All the artifacts and data that those
projects use are stored in the single database of the collection.
The following illustration shows how databases for project
collections are integrated with the logical architecture. When
you create a project, you specify the collection which will store its data.

Configure reporting
TheReportingpage only appears when you'veadded a report server to Azure DevOps. Choose this page to perform the following tasks:
Configure the report server for use by the collection.
When you edit the default folder location, the operation will fail if you type the path of a folder that does not exist on the server and you do not have permission to create a folder on that server. You must specify an existing folder if you do not have permissions to create folders on that server.
To remove the default location for report subfolders, chooseClear Configuration.
Removing the configuration removes the reporting functionality for all existing and future projects in the collection.

The wizard supports configuration of the following resources. Some
resources can only be configured if the application-tier server that
hosts the collection has been previously configured to support the
corresponding application.
Data Tier or SQL Server instance
Specify the
name of the Azure DevOps data-tier server. If you want to use a named
instance to host the database for this project collection,
you must also specify the name of the instance as in the following example:ServerName\InstanceName

instance to host the database for this project collection,
you must also specify the name of the instance as in the following example:

Detach or delete a project collection
You detach a project collection when you want to perform a
maintenance operation, such as moving or splitting a collection. Teams
can't access projects or source code when you detach the
collection.
You delete a collection when you no longer need the data stored in the
projects defined in the collection. The three steps to delete a
collection are (1) detach the collection and (2) delete the collection
database.
Detach the collection
From the administration console, highlight the name of the
collection that you want to delete, and then chooseDetach Collection.

expand the instance.Highlight the name of the collection database (by default,
TFS_CollectionName), and then delete
the database.For more information, seeDelete a Database.

Q & A
Q: Is there a command line tool for managing collections?
A:You can use theTFSConfig Collectioncommand to attach, detach, delete, or clone a project collection.

Q: What are the pros and cons of creating multiple project collections?
If your development efforts will benefit from the ability to branch and
merge code or you must query the status of work items that relate to the
same code, you should consolidate your projects in the same
project collection.
A: Advantages for creating more than one collection
You can better separate the operational needs for one code base or other
grouping of projects from the operational needs for another grouping.
Because the data for each collection is stored in its own database, you
can independently manage many aspects of each collection separately from
other collections in your deployment. For example, you can stop and
start each collection individually. Therefore, you can schedule
maintenance operations for each collection at different times.
Grouping projects into more than one collection provides the
following advantages:
Greater flexibility and scalability in managing
and distributing databases and resources. A group of related
projects share reports, work items, and process guidance, as
well as a code base.By creating a database for each collection, teams and administrators
can perform the following tasks:Build, branch, merge, and iterate an autonomous code base
according to the needs of the projects within the collection.
Code dependencies outside the collection can be
formally managed.Back up and restore the data for each collection independently
of other collections.Store all collection databases on a single instance of SQL
Server, or distribute the databases across one or
more instances.Detach a collection, back it up, and then restore it to a
different Azure DevOps deployment.Reassign resources to better meet the demands of projects as
they increase in size over time.

Increased operational security. Because
each collection has its own set of users and permissions, isolating
different code bases can be isolated under different collections.
Administrators can add users only to the collection that contains
the project or projects that pertain to that particular code base.

Increased capability to support custom workflow
processes. Each collection manages process templates, work
item types, link types, global lists, and work item fields separate
from other collections. By separating projects that have
different workflow processes into different collections, you only
expose those customizations needed to those projects within
a collection.

A: Disadvantages of creating more than one collection
The main disadvantage of creating more than one project collection
is that you increase the complexity of your Azure DevOps deployment.
You must backup and restore the database for each collection, and
other management and maintenance tasks also increase in proportion
to the number of collections that you have. For example, you must
manage the set of users and permissions for each project
collection individually.
Teams cannot link work items across collections.
Teams cannot branch or merge code across collections.
Teams cannot create queries across collections.
Q: What resources are managed at the collection level?
A:Each project belongs to a collection. To learn about managing a collection, seeGet started managing your organization or project collection.
Q: How does data stored for different team collections support reporting?
A:A single relational data warehouse
contains all reportable data from all projects that are defined in
all project collections for an Azure DevOps deployment. Data from that warehouse
is then processed and written to the OLAP cube. Because data is
collected into a single data warehouse, you can report across multiple
project collections.
To create or customize reports, you mustadd user accounts to the TfsWarehouseDataReader role.
Report authors need read access to both the relational data warehouse
and Analysis Services cube. These accounts can view data for all team
projects that are hosted in all project collections in the Azure DevOps
deployment. There is no way to limit access to a project or
collection.
Q: How do I scale my deployment with collections?
A:SeeMove a project collectionorSplit a project collection.
