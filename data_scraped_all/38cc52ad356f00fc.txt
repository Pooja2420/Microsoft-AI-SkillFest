In this article, you learn how to create a custom IPv6 address prefix. You prepare a range to provision, provision the range for IP allocation, and enable the range to be advertised by Microsoft.
A custom IPv6 address prefix enables you to bring your own IPv6 ranges to Microsoft and associate it to your Azure subscription. The range would continue to be owned by you, though Microsoft would be permitted to advertise it to the Internet. A custom IP address prefix functions as a regional resource that represents a contiguous block of customer owned IP addresses.
For this article, choose between the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to create a custom IPv6 address prefix.
Differences between using BYOIPv4 and BYOIPv6
Important
Onboarded custom IPv6 address prefixes have several unique attributes which make them different than custom IPv4 address prefixes.
Custom IPv6 prefixes use aparent/childmodel. In this model, the Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN) advertises the global (parent) range, and the respective Azure regions advertise the regional (child) ranges. Global ranges must be /48 in size, while regional ranges must always be /64 size. You can have multiple /64 ranges per region.

Only the global range needs to be validated using the steps detailed inCreate Custom IP Address Prefix. The regional ranges are derived from the global range in a similar manner to the way public IP prefixes are derived from custom IP prefixes.

Public IPv6 prefixes must be derived from the regional ranges. Only the first 2048 IPv6 addresses of each regional /64 custom IP prefix can be utilized as valid IPv6 space. Attempting to create public IPv6 prefixes that span beyond this range results in an error.

For problems encountered during the provisioning process, please seeTroubleshooting for custom IP prefix.
Pre-provisioning steps
To utilize the Azure BYOIP feature, you must perform and number of steps prior to the provisioning of your IPv6 address range. Refer to theIPv4 instructionsfor details. All these steps should be completed for the IPv6 global (parent) range.
Note
When hexadecimal IPv6 characters (a-f) are used in an IPv6 Prefix (CIDR), the case of the Custom IP Prefix IPv6 Prefix (CIDR) used in the Custom IP Prefix object must match the case of the IPv6 prefix as generated for your Custom IP Prefix Signed message.
Provisioning for IPv6
The following steps display the modified steps for provisioning a sample global (parent) IPv6 range (2a05:f500:2::/48) and regional (child) IPv6 ranges. Some of the steps have been abbreviated or condensed from theIPv4 instructionsto focus on the differences between IPv4 and IPv6.
Note
Clean up or delete steps aren't shown on this page given the nature of the resource. For information on removing a provisioned custom IP prefix, seeManage custom IP prefix.

Provision a global custom IPv6 address prefix
The following flow creates a custom IP prefix in the specified region and resource group. No zonal properties are provided because the global range isn't associated with any particular region (and therefore no regional availability zones).
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Create and provision a custom IPv6 address prefix
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterCustom IP.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterCustom IP.
In the search results, selectCustom IP Prefixes.
In the search results, selectCustom IP Prefixes.

SelectCreate.
The range is pushed to the Azure IP Deployment Pipeline. The deployment process is asynchronous. You can check the status by reviewing theCommissioned statefield for the custom IP prefix.
Provision a regional custom IPv6 address prefix
After the global custom IP prefix is in aProvisionedstate, regional custom IP prefixes can be created. These ranges must always be of size /64 to be considered valid. The ranges can be created in any region (it doesn't need to be the same as the global custom IP prefix), keeping in mind any geolocation restrictions associated with the original global range. The "children" custom IP prefixes advertise from the region they're created in. Because the validation is only done for global custom IP prefix provision, no Authorization or Signed message is required (but availability zones can be utilized).
In the sameCreate a custom IP prefixpage as before, enter or select the following information:
Similar to IPv4 custom IP prefixes, after the regional custom IP prefix is in aProvisionedstate, public IP prefixes can be derived from the regional custom IP prefix. These public IP prefixes and any public IP addresses derived from them can be attached to networking resources, though they aren't yet being advertised.
Important
Public IPv6 prefixes derived from regional custom IPv6 prefixes can only utilize the first 2048 IPs of the /64 range.
Commission the custom IPv6 address prefixes
When you commission custom IPv6 prefixes, the global and regional prefixes are treated separately. In other words, commissioning a regional custom IPv6 prefix isn't connected to commissioning the global custom IPv6 prefix.

The safest strategy for range migrations is as follows:
Provision all required regional custom IPv6 prefixes in their respective regions. Create public IPv6 prefixes and public IP addresses and attach to resources.
Commission each regional custom IPv6 prefix and test connectivity to the IPs within the region. Repeat for each regional custom IPv6 prefix.
After all regional custom IPv6 prefixes (and derived prefixes/IPs) have been verified to work as expected, commission the global custom IPv6 prefix, which will advertise the larger range to the Internet.
To commission a custom IPv6 prefix (regional or global) using the portal:
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterCustom IPand selectCustom IP Prefixes.
In the search box at the top of the portal, enterCustom IPand selectCustom IP Prefixes.
Verify the custom IPv6 prefix is in aProvisionedstate.
Verify the custom IPv6 prefix is in aProvisionedstate.
InCustom IP Prefixes, select the desired custom IPv6 prefix.
InCustom IP Prefixes, select the desired custom IPv6 prefix.
InOverviewpage of the custom IPv6 prefix, select theCommissionbutton near the top of the screen. If the range is global, it begins advertising from the Microsoft WAN. If the range is regional, it advertises only from the specific region.
InOverviewpage of the custom IPv6 prefix, select theCommissionbutton near the top of the screen. If the range is global, it begins advertising from the Microsoft WAN. If the range is regional, it advertises only from the specific region.
Using the example ranges above, the sequence would be to first commission myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix, followed by a commission of myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix.
Note
The estimated time to fully complete the commissioning process for a custom IPv6 global prefix is 3-4 hours. The estimated time to fully complete the commissioning process for a custom IPv6 regional prefix is 30 minutes.
It's possible to commission the global custom IPv6 prefix prior to the regional custom IPv6 prefixes. Doing this advertises the global range to the Internet before the regional prefixes are ready so it's not recommended for migrations of active ranges. You can decommission a global custom IPv6 prefix while there are still active (commissioned) regional custom IPv6 prefixes. Also, you can decommission a regional custom IP prefix while the global prefix is still active (commissioned).
Important
As the global custom IPv6 prefix transitions to aCommissionedstate, the range is being advertised with Microsoft from the local Azure region and globally to the Internet by Microsoft's wide area network under Autonomous System Number (ASN) 8075. Advertising this same range to the Internet from a location other than Microsoft at the same time could potentially create BGP routing instability or traffic loss. For example, a customer on-premises building. Plan any migration of an active range during a maintenance period to avoid impact.
Create a resource group and specify the prefix and authorization messages
Create a resource group in the desired location for provisioning the global range resource.
Important
Although the resource for the global range will be associated with a region, the prefix will be advertised by the Microsoft WAN globally.

    --name myResourceGroup \
    --location westus2
az group create \

Provision a global custom IPv6 address prefix
The following command creates a custom IP prefix in the specified region and resource group. Specify the exact prefix in CIDR notation as a string to ensure there's no syntax error. (The-authorization-messageand-signed-messageparameters are constructed in the same manner as they are for IPv4; for more information, seeCreate a custom IP prefix - CLI.)   No zonal properties are provided because the global range isn't associated with any particular region (and therefore no regional availability zones).

    --authorization-message $byoipauth \
    --signed-message $byoipauthsigned
Provision a regional custom IPv6 address prefix
After the global custom IP prefix is in aProvisionedstate, regional custom IP prefixes can be created. These ranges must always be of size /64 to be considered valid. The ranges can be created in any region (it doesn't need to be the same as the global custom IP prefix), keeping in mind any geolocation restrictions associated with the original global range. The "children" custom IP prefixes advertise from the region they're created in. Because the validation is only done for global custom IP prefix provision, no Authorization or Signed message is required (but availability zones can be utilized).
az network custom-ip prefix create \
    --name myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location westus2 \
    --cidr â2a05:f500:2:1::/64â \
    --zone 1 2 3
az network custom-ip prefix create \
    --name myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location westus2 \
    --cidr â2a05:f500:2:1::/64â \
    --zone 1 2 3
Similar to IPv4 custom IP prefixes, after the regional custom IP prefix is in aProvisionedstate, public IP prefixes can be derived from the regional custom IP prefix. These public IP prefixes and any public IP addresses derived from them can be attached to networking resources, though they aren't yet being advertised.
Important
Public IPv6 prefixes derived from regional custom IPv6 prefixes can only utilize the first 2048 IPs of the /64 range.
Commission the custom IPv6 address prefixes
When commissioning custom IPv6 prefixes, the global and regional prefixes are treated separately. In other words, commissioning a regional custom IPv6 prefix isn't connected to commissioning the global custom IPv6 prefix.

Commission each regional custom IPv6 prefix and test connectivity to the IPs within the region. Repeat for each regional custom IPv6 prefix.
After all regional custom IPv6 prefixes (and derived prefixes/IPs) have been verified to work as expected, commission the global custom IPv6 prefix, which will advertise the larger range to the Internet.
Using the example ranges above, the command sequence would be:
az network custom-ip prefix update \
    --name myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --state commission
az network custom-ip prefix update \
    --name myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --state commission
Followed by:
az network custom-ip prefix update \
    --name myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --state commission
az network custom-ip prefix update \
    --name myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --state commission
Note
The estimated time to fully complete the commissioning process for a custom IPv6 global prefix is 3-4 hours. The estimated time to fully complete the commissioning process for a custom IPv6 regional prefix is 30 minutes.
It's possible to commission the global custom IPv6 prefix prior to the regional custom IPv6 prefixes. Doing this advertises the global range to the Internet before the regional prefixes are ready so it's not recommended for migrations of active ranges.

Create a resource group and specify the prefix and authorization messages
Create a resource group in the desired location for provisioning the global range resource.
Important
Although the resource for the global range will be associated with a region, the prefix will be advertised by the Microsoft WAN globally.

Provision a global custom IPv6 address prefix
The following command creates a custom IP prefix in the specified region and resource group. Specify the exact prefix in CIDR notation as a string to ensure there's no syntax error. (The-AuthorizationMessageand-SignedMessageparameters are constructed in the same manner as they are for IPv4; for more information, seeCreate a custom IP prefix - PowerShell.)

    CIDR = '2a05:f500:2:1::/64'
}
$myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix = New-AzCustomIPPrefix @prefix -Zone 1,2,3
Similar to IPv4 custom IP prefixes, after the regional custom IP prefix is in aProvisionedstate, public IP prefixes can be derived from the regional custom IP prefix. These public IP prefixes and any public IP addresses derived from them can be attached to networking resources, though they aren't yet being advertised.
Important
Public IPv6 prefixes derived from regional custom IPv6 prefixes can only utilize the first 2048 IPs of the /64 range.

After all regional custom IPv6 prefixes (and derived prefixes/IPs) have been verified to work as expected, commission the global custom IPv6 prefix, which will advertise the larger range to the Internet.
Using the example ranges above, the command sequence would be:
Update-AzCustomIpPrefix -ResourceId $myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix.Id -Commission
Update-AzCustomIpPrefix -ResourceId $myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix.Id -Commission
Followed by:
Update-AzCustomIpPrefix -ResourceId $myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix.Id -Commission
