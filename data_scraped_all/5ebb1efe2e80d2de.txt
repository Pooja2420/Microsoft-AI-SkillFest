In this article, you learn how to automate an existing load test by creating a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines. Select your test in Azure Load Testing, and directly configure a pipeline in Azure DevOps that triggers your load test with every source code commit. Automate load tests with CI/CD to continuously validate your application performance and stability under load.
If you want to automate your load test with GitHub Actions, learn how tomanually configure a CI/CD pipeline for Azure Load Testing.

Configure a CI/CD pipeline
In this section, you'll create a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines to run an existing load test. The test files like test script andtest configuration YAMLwill be committed to your repository.
In theAzure portal, go to your Azure load testing resource.

If you're getting an error creating a PAT token, or you don't see any repositories, make sure toconnect your Azure DevOps organization to Microsoft Entra ID. Make sure the directory in Azure DevOps matches the directory you're using for Azure Load Testing. After connecting to Microsoft Entra ID, close and reopen your browser window.

Optionally, you can open the pipeline definition and modify the pipeline steps or change when the pipeline is triggered.

You now have a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines that invokes your load test when the pipeline is triggered. By default, the pipeline is triggered whenever you push an update to the selected branch.

Grant permission to service connection
When you run the CI/CD pipeline for the first time, you need to grant permission to the pipeline to access the service connection and start the load test.
Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization (https://dev.azure.com/<your-organization>), and select your project.Replace the<your-organization>text placeholder with your project identifier.

The CI/CD pipeline run now starts and accesses the Azure load testing resource to run the test.
View load test results in CI/CD
You can view the load test summary results directly in the CI/CD output log.

The generated CI/CD pipeline publishes the load test results as a pipeline artifact. You can download these results as a CSV file for further reporting.
