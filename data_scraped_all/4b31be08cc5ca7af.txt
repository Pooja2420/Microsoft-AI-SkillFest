A cross-cluster join involves joining data from datasets that reside in different clusters.
In a cross-cluster join, the query can be executed in three possible locations, each with a specific designation for reference throughout this document:
Local cluster: The cluster to which the request is sent, which is also known as the cluster hosting the database in context.
Left cluster: The cluster hosting the data on the left side of the join operation.
Right cluster: The cluster hosting the data on the right side of the join operation.
The cluster that runs the query fetches the data from the other cluster.
Note
If the data on the left and right sides of a join operation is hosted in the same cluster, it isn't considered a cross-cluster join, even if the data is hosted outside of the local cluster.

Strategies
The following list explains the supported values for theStrategyparameter:
left: Execute join on the cluster of the left table, or left cluster.
left
right: Execute join on the cluster of the right table, or right cluster.
right
local: Execute join on the cluster of the current cluster, or local cluster.
local
auto: (Default) Kusto makes the remoting decision.
auto
Note
The join remoting hint is ignored if the hinted strategy isn't applicable to the join operation.
How the auto strategy works
By default, theautostrategy determines where the cross-cluster join is executed based on the following rules:
auto
If one of the tables is hosted in the local cluster, then the join is performed on the local cluster. For example, with the auto strategy, this query is executed on the local cluster:T | ... | join (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
If one of the tables is hosted in the local cluster, then the join is performed on the local cluster. For example, with the auto strategy, this query is executed on the local cluster:
T | ... | join (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
T | ... | join (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
If both tables are hosted outside of the local cluster, then join is performed on the right cluster. For example, assuming neither cluster is the local cluster, the join would be executed on the right cluster:cluster("B").database("DB").T | ... | join (cluster("C").database("DB2").T2 | ...) on Col1
If both tables are hosted outside of the local cluster, then join is performed on the right cluster. For example, assuming neither cluster is the local cluster, the join would be executed on the right cluster:
cluster("B").database("DB").T | ... | join (cluster("C").database("DB2").T2 | ...) on Col1
cluster("B").database("DB").T | ... | join (cluster("C").database("DB2").T2 | ...) on Col1
Performance considerations
For optimal performance, we recommend running the query on the cluster that contains the largest table.
In the following example, if the dataset produced byT | ...is smaller than one produced bycluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...then it would be more efficient to execute the join operation on clusterB, in this case the right cluster instead of on the local cluster.
T | ...
cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...
B
T | ... | join (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
T | ... | join (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
You can rewrite the query to usehint.remote=rightto optimize the performance. In this way, the join operation is performed on the right cluster, even if left table is in the local cluster.
hint.remote=right
T | ... | join hint.remote=right (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
T | ... | join hint.remote=right (cluster("B").database("DB").T2 | ...) on Col1
