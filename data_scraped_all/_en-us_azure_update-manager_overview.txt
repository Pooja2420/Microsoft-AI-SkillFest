Important
Both Azure Automation Update Management and the Log Analytics agent it useshave been retired on 31st August 2024. Therefore, if you are using the Automation Update Management solution, we recommend that you move to Azure Update Manager for your software update needs. Follow theguidanceto move your machines and schedules from Automation Update Management to Azure Update Manager.
For more information, see theFAQs on retirement.
Update Manager is a unified service to help manage and govern updates for all your machines (running a server operating system). You can monitor Windows and Linux update compliance across your machines in Azure, and on-premises or other cloud environments (connected byAzure Arc) from a single pane of management. You can also use Update Manager to make real-time updates or schedule them within a defined maintenance window.
You can use Azure Update Manager for :
Unified Update Management- Monitor update compliance across Windows and Linux machines (running a server operating system) from a single dashboard, including machines in Azure, and on-premises or other cloud environments (connected by Azure Arc).
Flexible patching options:Schedule updates withincustomer-defined maintenance, for both Azure and Arc-connected machines.Apply updates in real-timeUseAutomatic VM guest patching, to automatically apply updates to Azure VMs without requiring manual intervention.Usehotpatching, to apply critical updates to Azure VMs without requiring a reboot, minimizing downtime

Security and Compliance tracking- Apply security and critical patches with enhanced security measures and compliance tracking.
Periodic update Assessments- Enableperiodic assessmentsto check for updates every 24 hours.
Dynamic Scoping- Group machines based on criteria and apply updates at scale.
Custom Reporting and Alerts- Build custom dashboards to report update status andconfigure alertsto notify you of update statuses and any issues that arise.
Granular Access Control- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate permissions for patch management tasks at a per-resource level.
