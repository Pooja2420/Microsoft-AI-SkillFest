Enhanced data for reservation costs and usage is available for Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) usage in Cost management. This article helps you:
Get reservation purchase data
Know which subscription, resource group or resource used the reservation
Chargeback for reservation utilization
Calculate reservation savings
Get reservation under-utilization data
Amortize reservation costs
Marketplace charges are consolidated in usage data. You view charges for first party usage, marketplace usage, and purchases from a single data source.
Reservation charges in Azure usage data
Data is divided into two separate data sets:Actual CostandAmortized Cost. How these two datasets differ:
Actual Cost- Provides data to reconcile with your monthly bill. This data has reservation purchase costs and reservation application details. With this data, you can know which subscription or resource group or resource received the reservation discount in a particular day. The EffectivePrice for the usage that receives the reservation discount is zero.
Amortized Cost- This dataset is similar to the Actual Cost dataset except that - the EffectivePrice for the usage that gets reservation discount is the prorated cost of the reservation (instead of being zero). This helps you know the monetary value of reservation consumption by a subscription, resource group or a resource, and can help you charge back for the reservation utilization internally. The dataset also has unused reservation hours. The dataset does not have reservation purchase records.
Comparison of two data sets:
Other information available in Azure usage data has changed:
Product and Meter information - Azure doesn't replace the originally consumed meter with the ReservationId and ReservationName, as it did previously.
ReservationId and ReservationName - They are their own fields in the data. Previously, it used to be available only under AdditionalInfo.
ProductOrderId - The reservation order ID, added as its own field.
ProductOrderName - The product name of the purchased reservation.
Term - 12 months or 36 months.
RINormalizationRatio - Available under AdditionalInfo. This is the ratio where the reservation is applied to the usage record. If instance size flexibility is enabled on for your reservation, then it can apply to other sizes. The value shows the ratio that the reservation was applied to for the usage record.
For more information, see the Usage details fieldDefinitions.
Get Azure consumption and reservation usage data using API
You can get the data using the API or download it from Azure portal.
For information about permissions needed to view and manage reservations, seeWho can manage a reservation by default.
You call theUsage Details APIto get the new data. For details about terminology, seeusage terms.
Here's an example call to the Usage Details API:
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{enrollmentId}/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingPeriods/{billingPeriodId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usagedetails?metric={metric}&amp;api-version=2019-05-01&amp;$filter={filter}
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{enrollmentId}/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingPeriods/{billingPeriodId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usagedetails?metric={metric}&amp;api-version=2019-05-01&amp;$filter={filter}
For more information about {enrollmentId} and {billingPeriodId}, see theUsage Details â ListAPI article.
Information in the following table about metric and filter can help solve for common reservation problems.
Download the EA usage CSV file with new data
If you're an EA admin, you can download the CSV file that contains new usage data from the Azure portal.
In the Azure portal, navigate toCost management + billing.
Select the billing account.
SelectUsage + charges.
SelectDownload.
InDownload Usage + Charges, underUsage Details Version 2, selectAll Charges (usage and purchases)and then select download. Repeat forAmortized charges (usage and purchases).

Common cost and usage tasks
The following sections are common tasks that most people use to view their reservation cost and usage data.
Get reservation purchase costs
Reservation purchase costs are available in Actual Cost data. Filter forChargeType = Purchase. Refer to ProductOrderID to determine which reservation order the purchase is for.
Get underutilized reservation quantity and costs
Get Amortized Cost data and filter forChargeType= UnusedReservation. You get the daily unused reservation quantity and the cost. You can filter the data for a reservation or reservation order usingReservationIdandProductOrderIdfields, respectively. If a reservation was 100% utilized, the record has a quantity of 0.
Amortize reservation costs
Get Amortized Cost data and filter for a reservation order usingProductOrderIDto get daily amortized costs for a reservation.
Chargeback for a reservation
You can chargeback reservation use to other organizations by subscription, resource groups, or tags. Amortized cost data provides monetary value of a reservation's utilization at the following data types:
Resources (such as a VM)
Resource group
Tags
Subscription
Get the blended rate for chargeback
To determine the blended rate, get the amortized costs data and aggregate the total cost. For VMs, you can use either MeterName or ServiceType information from AdditionalInfo JSON data. Divide the total cost by the quantity used to get the blended rate.
Audit optimum reservation use for instance size flexibility
Multiple the quantity with theRINormalizationRatio, from AdditionalInfo. The results indicate how many hours of reservation use was applied to the usage record.
Determine reservation savings
Get the Amortized costs data and filter the data for a reserved instance. Then:
Get estimated pay-as-you-go costs. Multiply theUnitPricevalue withQuantityvalues to get estimated pay-as-you-go costs, if the reservation discount didn't apply to the usage.
Get the reservation costs. Sum theCostvalues to get the monetary value of what you paid for the reserved instance. It includes the used and unused costs of the reservation.
Subtract reservation costs from estimated pay-as-you-go costs to get the estimated savings.
Keep in mind that if you have an underutilized reservation, theUnusedReservationentry forChargeTypebecomes a factor to consider. When you have a fully utilized reservation, you receive the maximum savings possible. AnyUnusedReservationquantity reduces savings.
Reservation purchases and amortization in cost analysis
Reservation costs are available incost analysis. By default, cost analysis showsActual cost, which is how costs are shown on your bill. To view reservation purchases broken down and associated with the resources which used the benefit, switch toAmortized cost:

Group by charge type to see a break down of usage, purchases, and refunds; or by reservation for a breakdown of reservation and on-demand costs. Remember the only reservation costs you will see when looking at actual cost are purchases, but costs will be allocated to the individual resources which used the benefit when looking at amortized cost. You will also see a newUnusedReservationcharge type when looking at amortized cost.
