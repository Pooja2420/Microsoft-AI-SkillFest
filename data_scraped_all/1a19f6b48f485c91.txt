Azure Functionsallows you to implement your system's logic as event-driven, readily available blocks of code. These code blocks are called "functions". This article is to help you find your way to the most helpful Azure Functions content as quickly as possible. For more general information about Azure Functions, see theIntroduction to Azure Functions.
Make sure to choose your preferred development language at the top of the article.
