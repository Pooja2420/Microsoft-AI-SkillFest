This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from Google BigQuery. It builds on theCopy Activity overviewarticle that presents a general overview of the copy activity.
Important
TheGoogle BigQuery V2 connectorprovides improved native Google BigQuery support. If you are using theGoogle BigQuery V1 connectorin your solution, pleaseupgrade your Google BigQuery connectoras V1 is atEnd of Support stage. Your pipeline will fail afterSeptember 30, 2025(Disabled date) if not upgraded. Refer to thissectionfor details on the difference between V2 and V1.
Supported capabilities
This Google BigQuery connector is supported for the following capabilities:
â  Azure integration runtime â¡ Self-hosted integration runtime
For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see theSupported data storestable.
The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity. Therefore, you don't need to manually install a driver to use this connector.
Note
This Google BigQuery connector is built on top of the BigQuery APIs. Be aware that BigQuery limits the maximum rate of incoming requests and enforces appropriate quotas on a per-project basis, refer toQuotas & Limits - API requests. Make sure you do not trigger too many concurrent requests to the account.
Get started
To perform the Copy activity with a pipeline, you can use one of the following tools or SDKs:
The Copy Data tool
The Azure portal
The .NET SDK
The Python SDK
Azure PowerShell
The REST API
The Azure Resource Manager template
Create a linked service to Google BigQuery using UI
Use the following steps to create a linked service to Google BigQuery in the Azure portal UI.
Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:Azure Data FactoryAzure Synapse
Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:
