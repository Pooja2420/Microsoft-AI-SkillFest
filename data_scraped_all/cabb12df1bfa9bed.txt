Palo Alto collector machine usage
This query displays a descending list of all collector machines hostname according to the amount of events they are recieving from a Palo Alto appliance.

// Quering on the past 7 days
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
// Quering only on incoming events from a Palo Alto appliance
| where DeviceProduct has 'PAN-OS'
| where DeviceVendor =~ 'Palo Alto Networks'
// Find the the collector machine with the highest usage
| summarize Count=count() by Computer
// Sort in a descending order- Most used Collector hostname comes first
| sort by Count desc

| summarize count_events=count() by DeviceEventClassID
// Sort in a descending order- most used DeviceEventClassID comes first
| sort by count_events desc
