Using Cloud Shell ephemeral sessions is the fastest way to start using Cloud Shell. Ephemeral
sessions don't require a storage account. When your Cloud Shell session ends, which occurs shortly
after the window is closed or when Cloud Shell is restarted, all files you saved are deleted and
don't persist across sessions.
Prerequisites
Before you can use Azure Cloud Shell, you must register theMicrosoft.CloudShellresource
provider. Access to resources is enabled through provider namespaces that must be registered in your
subscription. You only need to register the namespace once per subscription.
To see all resource providers, and the registration status for your subscription:
Sign in to theAzure portal.
