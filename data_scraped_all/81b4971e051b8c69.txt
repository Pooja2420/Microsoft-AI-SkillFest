You can use Azure Database Migration Service and the Azure SQL Migration extension in Azure Data Studio to migrate databases from an on-premises instance of SQL Server toSQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (SQL Server 2016 and later)with minimal downtime.
For database migration methods that might require some manual configuration, seeSQL Server instance migration to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
In this tutorial, you migrate theAdventureWorks2022database from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to a SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine with minimal downtime by using Azure Data Studio with Azure Database Migration Service.
AdventureWorks2022
This tutorial offers both offline and online migration options, including an acceptable downtime during the migration process.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Launch the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard in Azure Data Studio.
Run an assessment of your source SQL Server databases.
Collect performance data from your source SQL Server.
Get a recommendation of the SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine SKU best suited for your workload.
Specify details of your source SQL Server, backup location and your target SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine.
Create a new Azure Database Migration Service and install the self-hosted integration runtime to access source server and backups.
Start and monitor the progress for your migration.

TheAzure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studiono longer requires specific configurations on your Azure Storage account network settings to migrate your SQL Server databases to Azure. However, depending on your database backup location and desired storage account network settings, there are a few steps needed to ensure your resources can access the Azure Storage account. See the following table for the various migration scenarios and network configurations:ScenarioSMB network shareAzure Storage account containerEnabled from all networksNo extra stepsNo extra stepsEnabled from selected virtual networks and IP addressesSee 1aSee 2aEnabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses + private endpointSee 1bSee 2b
TheAzure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studiono longer requires specific configurations on your Azure Storage account network settings to migrate your SQL Server databases to Azure. However, depending on your database backup location and desired storage account network settings, there are a few steps needed to ensure your resources can access the Azure Storage account. See the following table for the various migration scenarios and network configurations:
1a - Azure Blob storage network configuration
If you have your Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) installed on an Azure VM, see section1b - Azure Blob storage network configuration. If you have your Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) installed on your on-premises network, you need to add your client IP address of the hosting machine in your Azure Storage account as so:

To apply this specific configuration, connect to the Azure portal from the SHIR machine, open the Azure Storage account configuration, selectNetworking, and then mark theAdd your client IP addresscheckbox. SelectSaveto make the change persistent. See section2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)for the remaining steps.
1b - Azure Blob storage network configuration
If your SHIR is hosted on an Azure VM, you need to add the virtual network of the VM to the Azure Storage account since the Virtual Machine has a nonpublic IP address that can't be added to the IP address range section.

To apply this specific configuration, locate your Azure Storage account, from theData storagepanel selectNetworking, then mark theAdd existing virtual networkcheckbox. A new panel opens up, select the subscription, virtual network, and subnet of the Azure VM hosting the Integration Runtime. This information can be found on theOverviewpage of the Azure Virtual Machine. The subnet might sayService endpoint requiredif so, selectEnable. Once everything is ready, save the updates. Refer to section2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)afor the remaining required steps.
2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)
If your backups are placed directly into an Azure Storage Container, all the above steps are unnecessary since there's no Integration Runtime communicating with the Azure Storage account. However, we still need to ensure that the target SQL Server instance can communicate with the Azure Storage account to restore the backups from the container. To apply this specific configuration, follow the instructions in section1b - Azure Blob storage network configuration, specifying the target SQL instance Virtual Network when filling out the "Add existing virtual network" popup.
2b - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)
If you have a private endpoint set up on your Azure Storage account, follow the steps outlined in section2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint). However, you need to select the subnet of the private endpoint, not just the target SQL Server subnet. Ensure the private endpoint is hosted in the same VNet as the target SQL Server instance. If it isn't, create another private endpoint using the process in the Azure Storage account configuration section.
Create a Database Migration Service instance
InStep 6: Azure Database Migration Servicein the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard, create a new instance of Azure Database Migration Service or reuse an existing instance that you created earlier.
Note
If you previously created a Database Migration Service instance by using the Azure portal, you can't reuse the instance in the migration wizard in Azure Data Studio. You can reuse an instance only if you created the instance by using Azure Data Studio.
Use an existing instance of Database Migration Service
To use an existing instance of Database Migration Service:
InResource group, select the resource group that contains an existing instance of Database Migration Service.
InResource group, select the resource group that contains an existing instance of Database Migration Service.

Self-hosted integration runtime is required to access your source database backups, check the validity of the backup set and upload them to Azure storage account.If your database backups are already on an Azure storage blob container, you don't need to setup self-hosted integration runtime.
For backups located on a network share provide the below details of your source SQL Server, source backup location, target database name and Azure storage account for the backup files to be uploaded to.FieldDescriptionSource Credentials - UsernameThe credential (Windows / SQL authentication) to connect to the source SQL Server instance and validate the backup files.Source Credentials - PasswordThe credential (Windows / SQL authentication) to connect to the source SQL Server instance and validate the backup files.Network share location that contains backupsThe network share location that contains the full and transaction log backup files. Any invalid files or backups files in the network share that don't belong to the valid backup set will be automatically ignored during the migration process.Windows user account with read access to the network share locationThe Windows credential (username) that has read access to the network share to retrieve the backup files.PasswordThe Windows credential (password) that has read access to the network share to retrieve the backup files.Target database nameThe target database name can be modified if you wish to change the database name on the target during the migration process.
For backups located on a network share provide the below details of your source SQL Server, source backup location, target database name and Azure storage account for the backup files to be uploaded to.
For backups stored in an Azure storage blob container, specify the below details of the Target database name, resource group, Azure storage account, Blob container from the corresponding dropdown lists.FieldDescriptionTarget database nameThe target database name can be modified if you wish to change the database name on the target during the migration process.Storage account detailsThe resource group, storage account and container where backup files are located.

TheAzure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studiono longer requires specific configurations on your Azure Storage account network settings to migrate your SQL Server databases to Azure. However, depending on your database backup location and desired storage account network settings, there are a few steps needed to ensure your resources can access the Azure Storage account. See the following table for the various migration scenarios and network configurations:
1a - Azure Blob storage network configuration
If you have your Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) installed on an Azure VM, see section1b - Azure Blob storage network configuration. If you have your Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) installed on your on-premises network, you need to add your client IP address of the hosting machine in your Azure Storage account as so:

To apply this specific configuration, connect to the Azure portal from the SHIR machine, open the Azure Storage account configuration, selectNetworking, and then mark theAdd your client IP addresscheckbox. SelectSaveto make the change persistent. See section2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)for the remaining steps.
1b - Azure Blob storage network configuration
If your SHIR is hosted on an Azure VM, you need to add the virtual network of the VM to the Azure Storage account since the Virtual Machine has a nonpublic IP address that can't be added to the IP address range section.

To apply this specific configuration, locate your Azure Storage account, from theData storagepanel selectNetworking, then mark theAdd existing virtual networkcheckbox. A new panel opens up, select the subscription, virtual network, and subnet of the Azure VM hosting the Integration Runtime. This information can be found on theOverviewpage of the Azure Virtual Machine. The subnet might sayService endpoint requiredif so, selectEnable. Once everything is ready, save the updates. Refer to section2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)afor the remaining required steps.
2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)
If your backups are placed directly into an Azure Storage Container, all the above steps are unnecessary since there's no Integration Runtime communicating with the Azure Storage account. However, we still need to ensure that the target SQL Server instance can communicate with the Azure Storage account to restore the backups from the container. To apply this specific configuration, follow the instructions in section1b - Azure Blob storage network configuration, specifying the target SQL instance Virtual Network when filling out the "Add existing virtual network" popup.
2b - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint)
If you have a private endpoint set up on your Azure Storage account, follow the steps outlined in section2a - Azure Blob storage network configuration (Private endpoint). However, you need to select the subnet of the private endpoint, not just the target SQL Server subnet. Ensure the private endpoint is hosted in the same VNet as the target SQL Server instance. If it isn't, create another private endpoint using the process in the Azure Storage account configuration section.

Complete migration cutover
The final step of the tutorial is to complete the migration cutover. The completion ensures the migrated database in SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine is ready for use. Downtime is required for applications that connect to the database and the timing of the cutover needs to be carefully planned with business or application stakeholders.
To complete the cutover:
Stop all incoming transactions to the source database.
Make application configuration changes to point to the target database in SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
Take a final log backup of the source database in the backup location specified
Put the source database in read-only mode. Therefore, users can read data from the database but not modify it.
Ensure all database backups have the statusRestoredin the monitoring details page.
SelectComplete cutoverin the monitoring details page.
During the cutover process, the migration status changes fromin progresstocompleting. The migration status changes tosucceededwhen the cutover process is completed. The database migration is successful and that the migrated database is ready for use.
Limitations
-If migrating a single database, the database backups must be placed in a flat-file structure inside a database folder (including container root folder), and the folders can't be nested, as it isn't supported.
-If migrating multiple databases using the same Azure Blob Storage container, you must place backup files for different databases in separate folders inside the container.
-Overwriting existing databases using DMS in your target SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine isn't supported.
-Configuring high availability and disaster recovery on your target to match source topology isn't supported by DMS.
The following server objects aren't supported:
SQL Server Agent jobs
Credentials
SSIS packages
Server audit
-You can't use an existing self-hosted integration runtime created from Azure Data Factory for database migrations with DMS. Initially, the self-hosted integration runtime should be created using the Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio and can be reused for further database migrations.
-VM with SQL Server 2008 and below as target versions aren't supported when migrating to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.
-If you're using a VM with SQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2014, you need to store your source database backup files on an Azure Storage Blob Container instead of using the network share option. Store the backup files as page blobs since block blobs are only supported in SQL 2016 and after.
-You must make sure the SQL IaaS Agent Extension in the target Azure Virtual Machine is inFull modeinstead of Lightweight mode.
-Migration to Azure SQL VM using DMS uses SQL IaaS agent internally. And SQL IaaS Agent Extension only supports management of Default Server Instance or Single Named Instance.
-You can migrate a maximum of 100 databases to the same Azure SQL Server Virtual Machine as the target using one or more migrations simultaneously. Moreover, once a migration(s) with 100 databases finishes, wait for at least 30 minutes before starting a new migration to the same Azure SQL Server Virtual Machine as the Target. Also, every migration operation (start migration, cutover) for each database takes a few minutes sequentially. For example, to migrate 100 databases, it might take approx. 200 (2 x 100) minutes to create the migration queues and approximately 100 (1 x 100) minutes to cutover all 100 databases (excluding backup and restore timing). Therefore, the migration becomes slower as the number of databases increases. You should either schedule a longer migration window in advance based on rigorous migration testing, or partitioning large number of databases into batches when migrating them to a SQL server Azure VM.
-Apart from configuring the Networking/Firewall of your Azure Storage Account to allow your VM to access backup files. You also need to configure the Networking/Firewall of your SQL Server on Azure VM to allow outbound connection to your storage account.
-You need to keep the target SQL Server on Azure VM powerONwhile the SQL Migration is in progress. Also, when creating a new migration, failover or cancel the migration.
Possible error messages
Error:Login failed for user 'NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery
Login failed for user 'NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery
Reason: SQL Server instance is in single-user mode. One possible reason is the target SQL Server on Azure VM is in upgrade mode.
Solution: Wait for the target SQL Server on Azure VM to exit the upgrade mode, and start migration again.
Error:Ext_RestoreSettingsError, message: Failed to create restore job.;Cannot create file 'F:\data\XXX.mdf' because it already exists.
Ext_RestoreSettingsError, message: Failed to create restore job.;Cannot create file 'F:\data\XXX.mdf' because it already exists.
Solution: Connect to the target SQL Server on Azure VM and delete theXXX.mdffile. Then, start migration again.
