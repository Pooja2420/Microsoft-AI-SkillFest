You can create an alias record for your apex domain name to reference an Azure Traffic Manager profile. Instead of using a redirecting service, you configure Azure DNS to reference a Traffic Manager profile directly from your zone.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a virtual network and a subnet.
Create a web server virtual machine with a public IP.
Add a DNS label to a public IP.
Create a Traffic Manager profile.
Create an alias record.
Test the alias record.
If you donât have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription.
A domain name hosted in Azure DNS. If you don't have an Azure DNS zone, you cancreate a DNS zone, thendelegate your domainto Azure DNS.
Note
In this tutorial,contoso.comis used as an example domain name. Replacecontoso.comwith your own domain name.
contoso.com
contoso.com
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Register the Microsoft.Network resource provider
To create alias records, you must register theMicrosoft.Networkresource provider. If the DNS zone and the alias target resource are in different subscriptions, both subscriptions must be registered. You can register resource providers using Azure CLI, PowerShell, or the Azure portal. See the following example:
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network
For more information, seeResolve errors for resource provider registration.
Create the network infrastructure

Note
DNS Queries to your newly aliased Traffic Manager recordset are displayed in your Traffic Manager profile billing. For more information on Traffic Manager billing, seeTraffic Manager pricing.
Test the alias record
From a web browser, browse tocontoso.comor your apex domain name. You see the IIS default page withHello World from Web-01. The Traffic Manager directed traffic toWeb-01IIS web server because it has the highest priority. Close the web browser and shut downWeb-01virtual machine. Wait a few minutes for the virtual machine to completely shut down.
contoso.com
Hello World from Web-01
Open a new web browser, and browse again tocontoso.comor your apex domain name.
contoso.com
You should see the IIS default page withHello World from Web-02. The Traffic Manager handled the situation and directed traffic to the second IIS server after shutting down the first server that has the highest priority.
Hello World from Web-02
