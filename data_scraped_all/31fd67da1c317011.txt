Applies to:Azure SQL DatabaseAzure Synapse Analytics (dedicated SQL pools only)
Network Security Perimeter (preview) secures both inbound and outbound network traffic between Azure SQL Database and other Platform as a Service (PaaS) resources (for example, Azure Storage and Azure Key Vault). Any attempts made to communicate with Azure resources that aren't inside the perimeter is blocked.
Important
This article applies to both Azure SQL Database anddedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)in Azure Synapse Analytics. These settings apply to all SQL Database and dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) databases associated with the server. For simplicity, the term 'database' refers to both databases in Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics. Likewise, any references to 'server' is referring to thelogical SQL serverthat hosts Azure SQL Database and dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse Analytics. This article doesnotapply to Azure SQL Managed Instance or dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces.

Using SQL Database with a Network Security Perimeter
By default, Network Security Perimeter usesLearning Mode, which can be used to log all traffic to and from SQL Database. The network traffic can be logged to a Log Analytics Workspace or Azure Storage account usingDiagnostic logging for Azure Network Security Perimeter. Finally, Network Security Perimeter can be switched toEnforcedmode. InEnforcedmode, any access denied shows the following error:
Error 42118
Login failed because the network security perimeter denied inbound access.
Error 42118
Login failed because the network security perimeter denied inbound access.
