Azure Functions documentation
Azure Functions is a managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider that provides event-driven and scheduled compute resources for Azure cloud services. You can focus on the code that matters most to you and Functions handles the rest. Functions can provide scalable and serverless hosting for your code projects written in the most productive language for you. You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.
