When you no longer need a data disk that's attached to a virtual machine, you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the virtual machine (VM), but doesn't remove it from storage. In this article, we're working with an Ubuntu LTS 16.04 distribution. If you're using a different distribution, the instructions for unmounting the disk might be different.
Warning
If you detach a disk it is not automatically deleted. If you have subscribed to Premium storage, you will continue to incur storage charges for the disk. For more information, seePricing and Billing when using Premium Storage.
If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.
Connect to the VM to unmount the disk
Before you can detach the disk using either CLI or the portal, you need to unmount the disk and removed references to if from your fstab file.
Connect to the VM. In this example, the public IP address of the VM is10.0.1.4with the usernameazureuser:
ssh azureuser@10.0.1.4
ssh azureuser@10.0.1.4
First, find the data disk that you want to detach. The following example uses dmesg to filter on SCSI disks:
dmesg | grep SCSI
dmesg | grep SCSI
The output is similar to the following example:
[    0.294784] SCSI subsystem initialized
[    0.573458] Block layer SCSI generic (bsg) driver version 0.4 loaded (major 252)
[    7.110271] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
[    8.079653] sd 3:0:1:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
[ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk
[    0.294784] SCSI subsystem initialized
[    0.573458] Block layer SCSI generic (bsg) driver version 0.4 loaded (major 252)
[    7.110271] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
[    8.079653] sd 3:0:1:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
[ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk
Here,sdcis the disk that we want to detach. You also should grab the UUID of the disk.
sudo -i blkid
sudo -i blkid
The output looks similar to the following example:
/dev/sda1: UUID="11111111-1b1b-1c1c-1d1d-1e1e1e1e1e1e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="22222222-2b2b-2c2c-2d2d-2e2e2e2e2e2e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdc1: UUID="33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sda1: UUID="11111111-1b1b-1c1c-1d1d-1e1e1e1e1e1e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="22222222-2b2b-2c2c-2d2d-2e2e2e2e2e2e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdc1: UUID="33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e" TYPE="ext4"
Edit the/etc/fstabfile to remove references to the disk.
Note
Improperly editing the/etc/fstabfile could result in an unbootable system. If unsure, refer to the distribution's documentation for information on how to properly edit this file. It is also recommended that a backup of the /etc/fstab file is created before editing.
Open the/etc/fstabfile in a text editor and remove the line containing the UUID of your disk. Using the example values in this article, the line would look like the following:
UUID=33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e   /datadrive   ext4   defaults,nofail   1   2
UUID=33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e   /datadrive   ext4   defaults,nofail   1   2
Save and close the file when you're done.
Next, useumountto unmount the disk. The following example unmounts the/dev/sdc1partition from the/datadrivemount point:
umount
sudo umount /dev/sdc1 /datadrive
sudo umount /dev/sdc1 /datadrive
Detach a data disk using Azure CLI
This example detaches themyDataDiskdisk from VM namedmyVMinmyResourceGroup.
az vm disk detach -g myResourceGroup --vm-name myVm -n myDataDisk
az vm disk detach -g myResourceGroup --vm-name myVm -n myDataDisk
The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.
Lower latency
In select regions, the disk detach latency has been reduced, so you see an improvement of up to 15%. This is useful if you have planned/unplanned failovers between VMs, you're scaling your workload, or are running a high scale stateful workload such as Azure Kubernetes Service. However, this improvement is limited to the explicit disk detach command,az vm disk detach. You won't see the performance improvement if you call a command that may implicitly perform a detach, likeaz vm update.  You don't need to take any action other than calling the explicit detach command to see this improvement.
az vm disk detach
az vm update
Lower latency is currently available in every public region except for:
Canada Central
Central US
East US
East US 2
South Central US
West US 2
Germany North
India West
North Europe
West Europe
Detach a data disk using the portal
In the left menu, selectVirtual Machines.
In the virtual machine blade, selectDisks.
In theDisksblade, to the far right of the data disk that you would like to detach, select the detach button, to detach the disk.
After the disk has been removed, selectSaveon the top of the blade.
The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine. The disk isn't deleted.
Next steps
If you want to reuse the data disk, you can justattach it to another VM.
If you want to delete the disk, so that you no longer incur storage costs, seeFind and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks - Azure portal.
