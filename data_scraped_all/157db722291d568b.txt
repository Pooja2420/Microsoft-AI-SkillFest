You can enable Azure Arc-enabled servers for one or a small number of Windows or Linux machines in your environment by performing a set of steps manually. Or you can use an automated method by running a template script that we provide. This script automates the download and installation of both agents.
This method requires that you have administrator permissions on the machine to install and configure the agent. On Linux, by using the root account, and on Windows, you are member of the Local Administrators group.
Before you get started, be sure to review theprerequisitesand verify that your subscription and resources meet the requirements. For information about supported regions and other related considerations, seesupported Azure regions.
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Note
Follow best security practices and avoid using an Azure account with Owner access to onboard servers. Instead, use an account that only has the Azure Connected Machine onboarding or Azure Connected Machine resource administrator role assignment. SeeAzure Identity Management and access control security best practicesfor more information.
Automatic connection for SQL Server
When you connect a Windows or Linux server to Azure Arc that also has Microsoft SQL Server installed, the SQL Server instances will automatically be connected to Azure Arc as well.SQL Server enabled by Azure Arcprovides a detailed inventory and additional management capabilities for your SQL Server instances and databases. As part of the connection process, an extension is deployed to your Azure Arc-enabled server andnew roleswill be applied to your SQL Server and databases. If you don't want to automatically connect your SQL Servers to Azure Arc, you can opt out by adding a tag to the Windows or Linux server with the nameArcSQLServerExtensionDeploymentand valueDisabledwhen it's connected to Azure Arc.

Generate the installation script from the Azure portal
Use the Azure portal to create a script that automates the agent download and installation and establishes the connection with Azure Arc. To complete the process, perform the following steps:

Install and validate the agent on Windows
Install manually
You can install the Connected Machine agent manually by running the Windows Installer packageAzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi. You can download the latest version of theWindows agent Windows Installer packagefrom the Microsoft Download Center.
Note
To install or uninstall the agent, you must haveAdministratorpermissions.
You must first download and copy the Installer package to a folder on the target server, or from a shared network folder. If you run the Installer package without any options, it starts a setup wizard that you can follow to install the agent interactively.
If the machine needs to communicate through a proxy server to the service, after you install the agent you need to run a command that's described in the steps below. This command sets the proxy server system environment variablehttps_proxy. Using this configuration, the agent communicates through the proxy server using the HTTP protocol.
https_proxy
If you are unfamiliar with the command-line options for Windows Installer packages, reviewMsiexec standard command-line optionsandMsiexec command-line options.
For example, run the installation program with the/?parameter to review the help and quick reference option.
/?
msiexec.exe /i AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi /?
msiexec.exe /i AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi /?
To install the agent silently and create a setup log file in theC:\Support\Logsfolder that exist, run the following command.msiexec.exe /i AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi /qn /l*v "C:\Support\Logs\Azcmagentsetup.log"If the agent fails to start after setup is finished, check the logs for detailed error information. The log directory is%ProgramData%\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\log.
To install the agent silently and create a setup log file in theC:\Support\Logsfolder that exist, run the following command.
C:\Support\Logs
msiexec.exe /i AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi /qn /l*v "C:\Support\Logs\Azcmagentsetup.log"
msiexec.exe /i AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi /qn /l*v "C:\Support\Logs\Azcmagentsetup.log"
If the agent fails to start after setup is finished, check the logs for detailed error information. The log directory is%ProgramData%\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\log.
If the machine needs to communicate through a proxy server, to set the proxy server environment variable, run the following command:[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("https_proxy", "http://{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}", "Machine")
$env:https_proxy = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("https_proxy","Machine")
# For the changes to take effect, the agent service needs to be restarted after the proxy environment variable is set.
Restart-Service -Name himdsNoteThe agent does not support setting proxy authentication.For more information, seeAgent-specific proxy configuration.

After installing the agent, you need to configure it to communicate with the Azure Arc service by running the following command:"%ProgramFiles%\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\azcmagent.exe" connect --resource-group "resourceGroupName" --tenant-id "tenantID" --location "regionName" --subscription-id "subscriptionID"

If the agent fails to start after setup is finished, check the logs for detailed error information. The log directory is%ProgramData%\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\log.
Install and validate the agent on Linux
The Connected Machine agent for Linux is provided in the preferred package format for the distribution (.RPM or .DEB) that's hosted in the Microsoftpackage repository. Theshell script bundleInstall_linux_azcmagent.shperforms the following actions:
Install_linux_azcmagent.sh
Configures the host machine to download the agent package from packages.microsoft.com.

Installs the Hybrid Resource Provider package.
Installs the Hybrid Resource Provider package.
Optionally, you can configure the agent with your proxy information by including the--proxy "{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}"parameter. Using this configuration, the agent communicates through the proxy server using the HTTP protocol.
--proxy "{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}"
The script also contains logic to identify the supported and unsupported distributions, and it verifies the permissions that are required to perform the installation.
The following example downloads the agent and installs it:
# Download the installation package.
wget https://aka.ms/azcmagent -O ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh

# Install the Azure Connected Machine agent.
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh
# Download the installation package.
wget https://aka.ms/azcmagent -O ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh

# Install the Azure Connected Machine agent.
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh
To download and install the agent, run the following commands. If your machine needs to communicate through a proxy server to connect to the internet, include the--proxyparameter.# Download the installation package.
wget https://aka.ms/azcmagent -O ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh

# Install the AZure Connected Machine agent.
bash ~/Install_linux_azcmagent.sh --proxy "{proxy-url}:{proxy-port}"

Verify the connection with Azure Arc
After you install the agent and configure it to connect to Azure Arc-enabled servers, go to the Azure portal to verify that the server has successfully connected. View your machines in theAzure portal.
