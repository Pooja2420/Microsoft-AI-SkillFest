Virtual network flow logs are a feature of Azure Network Watcher. You can use them to log information about IP traffic flowing through a virtual network.
Flow data from virtual network flow logs is sent to Azure Storage. From there, you can access the data and export it to any visualization tool, security information and event management (SIEM) solution, or intrusion detection system (IDS). Virtual network flow logs overcome some of the limitations ofNetwork security group flow logs.
Why use flow logs?
It's vital to monitor, manage, and know your network so that you can protect and optimize it. You might need to know the current state of the network, who's connecting, and where users are connecting from. You might also need to know which ports are open to the internet, what network behavior is expected, what network behavior is irregular, and when sudden rises in traffic happen.
Flow logs are the source of truth for all network activity in your cloud environment. Whether you're in a startup that's trying to optimize resources or a large enterprise that's trying to detect intrusion, flow logs can help. You can use them for optimizing network flows, monitoring throughput, verifying compliance, detecting intrusions, and more.
Common use cases
Identify unknown or undesired traffic.
Monitor traffic levels and bandwidth consumption.
Filter flow logs by IP and port to understand application behavior.
Export flow logs to analytics and visualization tools of your choice to set up monitoring dashboards.
Identify top talkers in your network.
Combine with GeoIP data to identify cross-region traffic.
Understand traffic growth for capacity forecasting.
Use data to remove overly restrictive traffic rules.
Use flow data to verify network isolation and compliance with enterprise access rules.
Analyze network flows from compromised IPs and network interfaces.
Export flow logs to any SIEM or IDS tool of your choice.
Virtual network flow logs compared to network security group flow logs
Both virtual network flow logs andnetwork security group flow logsrecord IP traffic, but they differ in their behavior and capabilities.
Virtual network flow logs simplify the scope of traffic monitoring because you can enable logging atvirtual networks. Traffic through all supported workloads within a virtual network is recorded.
Virtual network flow logs also avoid the need to enable multiple-level flow logging, such as innetwork security group flow logs. In network security group flow logs, network security groups are configured at both the subnet and the network interface (NIC).
In addition to existing support to identify traffic thatnetwork security group rulesallow or deny, Virtual network flow logs support identification of traffic thatAzure Virtual Network Manager security admin rulesallow or deny. Virtual network flow logs also support evaluating the encryption status of your network traffic in scenarios where you're usingvirtual network encryption.
Important
We recommend disabling network security group flow logs before enabling virtual network flow logs on the same underlying workloads to avoid duplicate traffic recording and additional costs.
If you enable network security group flow logs on the network security group of a subnet, then you enable virtual network flow logs on the same subnet or parent virtual network, you might get duplicate logging or only virtual network flow logs.
How logging works
Key properties of virtual network flow logs include:
Flow logs operate at Layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and record all IP flows going through a virtual network.
Logs are collected at one-minute intervals through the Azure platform. They don't affect your Azure resources or network traffic.
Logs are written in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
Each log record contains the network interface that the flow applies to, 5-tuple information, traffic direction, flow state, encryption state, and throughput information.
All traffic flows in your network are evaluated through the applicablenetwork security group rulesorAzure Virtual Network Manager security admin rules.

Log tuple and bandwidth calculation

Here's an example bandwidth calculation for flow tuples from a TCP conversation between203.0.113.105:35370and10.0.0.5:23:
203.0.113.105:35370
10.0.0.5:23
1708978215,203.0.113.105,10.0.0.5,35370,23,6,I,B,NX,,,,1708978215,203.0.113.105,10.0.0.5,35370,23,6,I,C,NX,1021,588096,8005,46108801708978215,203.0.113.105,10.0.0.5,35370,23,6,I,E,NX,52,29952,47,27072
1708978215,203.0.113.105,10.0.0.5,35370,23,6,I,B,NX,,,,
1708978215,203.0.113.105,10.0.0.5,35370,23,6,I,C,NX,1021,588096,8005,4610880

For continuation (C) and end (E) flow states, byte and packet counts are aggregate counts from the time of the previous flow's tuple record. In the example conversation, the total number of packets transferred is 1,021 + 52 + 8,005 + 47 = 9,125. The total number of bytes transferred is 588,096 + 29,952 + 4,610,880 + 27,072 = 5,256,000.

Considerations for virtual network flow logs
Storage account
Location: The storage account must be in the same region as the virtual network.
Subscription: The storage account must be in the same subscription of the virtual network or in a subscription associated with the same Microsoft Entra tenant of the virtual network's subscription.
Performance tier: The storage account must be standard. Premium storage accounts aren't supported.
Self-managed key rotation: If you change or rotate the access keys to your storage account, virtual network flow logs stop working. To fix this problem, you must disable and then re-enable virtual network flow logs.
Private endpoint traffic
Traffic can't be recorded at the private endpoint itself. You can capture traffic to a private endpoint at the source VM. The traffic is recorded with source IP address of the VM and destination IP address of the private endpoint. You can usePrivateEndpointResourceIdfield to identify traffic flowing to a private endpoint. For more information, seeTraffic analytics schema.
