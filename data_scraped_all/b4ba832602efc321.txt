You can create a new alert rule using thethe CLI,PowerShell, or anAzure Resource Manager template.
Prerequisites
To create or edit an alert rule, you must have the following permissions:
Read permission on the target resource of the alert rule.
Write permission on the resource group in which the alert rule is created. If you're creating the alert rule from the Azure portal, the alert rule is created by default in the same resource group in which the target resource resides.
Read permission on any action group associated to the alert rule, if applicable.
Create a new alert rule using the CLI
You can create a new alert rule using theAzure CLI. The following code examples useAzure Cloud Shell. You can see the full list of theAzure CLI commands for Azure Monitor.
In theportal, selectCloud Shell. At the prompt, use these.To create a metric alert rule, use theaz monitor metrics alert createcommand.To create a log search alert rule, use theaz monitor scheduled-query createcommand.To create an activity log alert rule, use theaz monitor activity-log alert createcommand.For example, to create a metric alert rule that monitors if average Percentage CPU on a VM is greater than 90:az monitor metrics alert create -n {nameofthealert} -g {ResourceGroup} --scopes {VirtualMachineResourceID} --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 90" --description {descriptionofthealert}

To create an activity log alert rule, use theaz monitor activity-log alert createcommand.
For example, to create a metric alert rule that monitors if average Percentage CPU on a VM is greater than 90:
az monitor metrics alert create -n {nameofthealert} -g {ResourceGroup} --scopes {VirtualMachineResourceID} --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 90" --description {descriptionofthealert}
az monitor metrics alert create -n {nameofthealert} -g {ResourceGroup} --scopes {VirtualMachineResourceID} --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 90" --description {descriptionofthealert}
Create a new alert rule using PowerShell
To create a metric alert rule using PowerShell, use theAdd-AzMetricAlertRuleV2cmdlet.NoteWhen you create a metric alert on a single resource, the syntax uses theTargetResourceId. When you create a metric alert on multiple resources, the syntax contains theTargetResourceScope,TargetResourceType, andTargetResourceRegion.

To create a log search alert rule using PowerShell, use theNew-AzScheduledQueryRulecmdlet.
To create an activity log alert rule using PowerShell, use theNew-AzActivityLogAlertcmdlet.
Create a new alert rule using an ARM template
You can use anAzure Resource Manager template (ARM template)to configure alert rules consistently in all of your environments.
Create a new resource, using the following resource types:For metric alerts:Microsoft.Insights/metricAlertsNoteWe recommend that you create the metric alert using the same resource group as your target resource.Metric alerts for an Azure Log Analytics workspace resource type (Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces) are configured differently than other metric alerts. For more information, seeResource Template for Metric Alerts for Logs.If you are creating a metric alert for a single resource, the template uses theResourceIdof the target resource. If you are creating a metric alert for multiple resources, the template uses thescope,TargetResourceType, andTargetResourceRegionfor the target resources.For log search alerts:Microsoft.Insights/scheduledQueryRulesFor activity log, service health, and resource health alerts:microsoft.Insights/activityLogAlerts

If you are creating a metric alert for multiple resources, the template uses thescope,TargetResourceType, andTargetResourceRegionfor the target resources.
