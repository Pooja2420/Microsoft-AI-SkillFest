Microsoft Entra groups are used to manage users that all need the same access and permissions to resources, such as potentially restricted apps and services. Instead of adding special permissions to individual users, you create a group that applies the special permissions to every member of that group.
This article covers basic group scenarios where a single group is added to a single resource and users are added as members to that group. For more complex scenarios like dynamic membership groups and rule creation, see theMicrosoft Entra user management documentation.
Before adding groups and members,learn about groups and membership typesto help you decide which options to use when you create a group.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required to manage groups in Microsoft Entra:
User AdministratororGroups Administratorrole is required to manage group membership settings.

Add a group to another group
For the security group type, you can add an existing group to another group (also known as nested groups). Depending on the group membership types, you can add a group as a member of another group. Nested groups can be used for membership and Conditional Access scopes. Nested groups don't gain access to shared resources and applications that are assigned to the parent group.
We currently don't support:
Adding groups to a group synced with on-premises Active Directory.
Adding security groups to Microsoft 365 groups.
Adding Microsoft 365 groups to security groups or other Microsoft 365 groups.
Assigned membership to shared resources and apps for nested security groups.
Applying licenses to nested security groups.
Adding distribution groups in nesting scenarios.
Adding security groups as members of mail-enabled security groups.
Adding groups as members of a role-assignable group.
