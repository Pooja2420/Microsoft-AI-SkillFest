This article outlines the organizational process for planning AI adoption. An AI adoption plan details the steps an organization must take to integrate AI into its operations. This plan ensures alignment between AI initiatives and business goals. It helps organizations allocate resources, develop skills, and deploy technology for effective AI adoption.

Assess AI skills
In yourtechnology strategy, you defined AI use cases and selected solutions. Each solution requires specific AI skills. Assess your current skills, identify gaps, and address them before implementation. Use an AI maturity assessment to measure readiness, align use cases with capabilities, and accelerate progress. Refer to the following table to assess your maturity.
Acquire AI skills
Start by assessing your current talent pool, then decide whether to upskill existing staff, recruit new talent, or engage external experts. A skilled team helps you manage AI projects, adapt to change, and drive innovation. Because AI evolves rapidly, foster a culture of continuous learning.
Learn AI skills.Use theAI learning hubplatform for free AI training, certifications, and product guidance. For Azure, set certification goals, such asAzure AI Fundamentals,Azure AI Engineer Associate, andAzure Data Scientist Associatecertifications.

Recruit AI professionals.Hire experts in model development, generative AI, or AI ethics to fill gaps beyond internal capacity. Update job descriptions to reflect evolving skill needs. Build an employer brand that emphasizes innovation and technical leadership. Partner with universities to access emerging talent.

Prioritize AI use cases
Prioritize the use cases defined in yourAI Strategy. Focus on projects that provide the most value, align with business goals, and match your current capabilities.
Assess skills and resources. Review your AI maturity, data availability, tools, and staffing. Use this input to reset priorities based on what's achievable.

Create an AI proof of concept
If you plan to build an AI agent or workload, create a proof of concept (PoC) to validate feasibility and value. The PoC or trial helps prioritize use cases, reduce risk, and uncover challenges before scaling.
Choose the right use case.Select a high-value project from your AI shortlist that matches your AI maturity. If you're building an AI app, start with an internal, non-customer-facing project to limit risk and test your approach. Use A/B testing to validate the solution and gather baseline data.

Implement responsible AI
Build responsible AI into your implementation plan from the start. Apply ethical principles, follow regulatory standards, and create governance practices that ensure your AI systems align with organizational values, protect user rights, and meet compliance requirements.
Use responsible AI planning tools.Use the following table to find responsible AI tools and frameworks.Responsible AI planning toolDescriptionAI impact assessment templateEvaluate the social, economic, and ethical effects of AI initiatives.Human-AI eXperience ToolkitDesign AI systems that support user well-being and positive interaction.Responsible AI Maturity ModelAssess and advance your organizationâs responsible AI maturity.Responsible AI for workload teamsFollow practical guidance for applying responsible AI in Azure workloads.

Estimate delivery timelines
Assign a delivery timeline to each AI opportunity based on insights from your PoC. Microsoft Copilots provide the shortest timelines for seeing a return on investment (days to weeks). Timelines for building AI workloads with Azure vary by use case and your AI maturity level. Most build projects require several weeks to months to reach production readiness.
