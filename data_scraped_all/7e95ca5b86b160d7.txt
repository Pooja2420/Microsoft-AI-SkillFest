SMB volumes in Azure NetApp Files can leverage NTFS security styles to make use of NTFS access control lists (ACLs) for access controls.
NTFS ACLs provide granular permissions and ownership for files and folders by way of access control entries (ACEs). Directory permissions can also be set to enable or disable inheritance of permissions.

For a complete overview of NTFS-style ACLs, seeMicrosoft Access Control overview.
