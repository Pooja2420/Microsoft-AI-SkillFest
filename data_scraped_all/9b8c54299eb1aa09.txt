Change Tracking and Inventory using Log Analytics agent has retired on31 August 2024and will not be supported any further. Follow the guidelines formigration from Change Tracking and inventory using Log Analytics to Change Tracking and inventory using Azure Monitoring Agent version
We recommend that you use Change Tracking with Azure Monitoring Agent with the Change tracking extension version 2.20.0.0 (or above) to access the GA version of this service.
This article explains on the latest version of change tracking support using Azure Monitoring Agent as a singular agent for data collection.
Note
File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) usingMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)is now currently available. If you have FIM configured with either AMA or LA, follow the guidance to migrate from:
FIM with Change Tracking and Inventory using AMA.
FIM with Change Tracking and Inventory using MMA.
What is Change Tracking & Inventory
Azure Change Tracking & Inventory service enhances the auditing and governance for in-guest operations by monitoring changes and providing detailed inventory logs for servers across Azure, on-premises, and other cloud environments.
Change Trackinga. Monitors changes, including modifications to files, registry keys, software installations, and Windows services or Linux daemons.b. Provides detailed logs of what and when the changes were made, enabling you to quickly detect configuration drifts or unauthorized changes.Change Tracking metadata will get ingested into the ConfigurationChange table in the connected LA workspace.Learn more

Key benefits
Compatibility with the unified monitoring agent- Compatible with theAzure Monitor Agentthat enhances security, reliability, and facilitates multi-homing experience to store data.
Compatibility with tracking tool- Compatible with the Change tracking (CT) extension deployed through the Azure Policy on the client's virtual machine. You can switch to Azure Monitor Agent (AMA), and then the CT extension pushes the software, files, and registry to AMA.
Multi-homing experienceâ Provides standardization of management from one central workspace. You cantransition from Log Analytics (LA) to AMAso that all VMs point to a single workspace for data collection and maintenance.
Rules managementâ UsesData Collection Rulesto configure or customize various aspects of data collection. For example, you can change the frequency of file collection.
Limits
The following table shows the tracked item limits per machine for change tracking and inventory.
Supported operating systems
Change Tracking and Inventory is supported on all operating systems that meet Azure Monitor agent requirements. Seesupported operating systemsfor a list of the Windows and Linux operating system versions that are currently supported by the Azure Monitor agent.
To understand client requirements for TLS, seeTLS for Azure Automation.
Enable Change Tracking and Inventory
You can enable Change Tracking and Inventory in the following ways:
Manually for non-Azure Arc-enabled machines, Refer to the InitiativeEnable Change Tracking and Inventory for Arc-enabled virtual machinesinPolicy > Definitions > Select Category = ChangeTrackingAndInventory. To enable Change Tracking and Inventory at scale, use theDINE Policybased solution. For more information, seeEnable Change Tracking and Inventory using Azure Monitoring Agent (Preview).

Tracking file changes
For tracking changes in files on both Windows and Linux, Change Tracking and Inventory uses SHA256 hashes of the files. The feature uses the hashes to detect if changes have been made since the last inventory.
Tracking file content changes
Change Tracking and Inventory allows you to view the contents of a Windows or Linux file. For each change to a file, Change Tracking and Inventory stores the contents of the file in anAzure Storage account. When you're tracking a file, you can view its contents before or after a change. The file content can be viewed either inline or side by side.Learn more.

Tracking of registry keys
Change Tracking and Inventory allows monitoring of changes to Windows registry keys. Monitoring allows you to pinpoint extensibility points where third-party code and malware can activate. The following table lists pre-configured (but not enabled) registry keys. To track these keys, you must enable each one.

Recursion support
Change Tracking and Inventory supports recursion, which allows you to specify wildcards to simplify tracking across directories. Recursion also provides environment variables to allow you to track files across environments with multiple or dynamic drive names. The following list includes common information you should know when configuring recursion:
Wildcards are required for tracking multiple files.
Wildcards are required for tracking multiple files.
You can use wildcards only in the last segment of a file path, for example,c:\folder\file* or/etc/*.conf.
You can use wildcards only in the last segment of a file path, for example,c:\folder\file* or/etc/*.conf.
If an environment variable has an invalid path, validation succeeds but the path fails during execution.
If an environment variable has an invalid path, validation succeeds but the path fails during execution.
You should avoid general path names when setting the path, as this type of setting can cause too many folders to be traversed.

Change Tracking and Inventory data collection
The next table shows the data collection frequency for the types of changes supported by Change Tracking and Inventory. Inventory logs will be populated every 10 hours by default for all data types. Additionally, when there is a change registered for any of the data types, the inventory and change logs will be generated for this instance.
The following table shows the tracked item limits per machine for Change Tracking and Inventory.

To enable tracking of Windows Services data, you must upgrade CT extension and use extension more than or equal to 2.11.0.0

Current limitations
Change Tracking and Inventory using Azure Monitoring Agent doesn't support or has the following limitations:
Recursion for Windows registry tracking
Currently, only the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is supported. You will encounter this limitation whenever you manually add the registry key.
Network file systems
Different installation methods
*.exefiles stored on Windows
TheMax File Sizecolumn and values are unused in the current implementation.
If you are tracking file changes, it is limited to a file size of 5 MB or less.
If the file size appears >1.25MB, then FileContentChecksum is incorrect due to memory constraints in the checksum calculation.
If you try to collect more than 2500 files in a 30-minute collection cycle, Change Tracking and Inventory performance might be degraded.
If network traffic is high, change records can take up to six hours to display.
If you modify a configuration while a machine or server is shut down, it might post changes belonging to the previous configuration.
Collecting Hotfix updates on Windows Server 2016 Core RS3 machines.
Linux daemons might show a changed state even though no change has occurred. This issue arises because of how theSvcRunLevelsdata in the Azure MonitorConfigurationChangetable is written.
SvcRunLevels
Change Tracking extension doesn't support any hardening standards for any Linux Operating systems or Distros.
Support for alerts on configuration state
A key capability of Change Tracking and Inventory is alerting on changes to the configuration state of your hybrid environment. Many useful actions are available to trigger in response to alerts. For example, actions on Azure functions, Automation runbooks, webhooks, and the like. Alerting on changes to thec:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hostsfile for a machine is one good application of alerts for Change Tracking and Inventory data. There are many more scenarios for alerting as well, including the query scenarios defined in the next table.
