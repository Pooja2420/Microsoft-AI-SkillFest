What is a resource group
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources sharing the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group.
The Azure portal uses the resource group scope to create views that span across multiple resources. For example:
Metrics bladeprovides metrics information (CPU, resources) to users.
Deployments bladeshows the history of ARM template or Bicep deployments targeted to that resource group (which includes portal deployments).
Policy bladeprovides information related to the policies enforced on the resource group.
Diagnostics settings bladeprovides errors and warnings to review.
The resource group stores metadata about the resources. When you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you might need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region. Resources inside a resource group can be in different regions.

For more information about how Resource Manager arranges how resources are deleted, seeAzure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion.
Deploy resources to a resource group
After you create a Resource Manager template, use the Azure portal to deploy your Azure resources. For information about creating a template, seeQuickstart: Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates by using the Azure portal. For information about using the portal to deploy a template, seeDeploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure portal.
Move to another resource group or subscription
You can move resources from one resource group to another. For more information and guidance, seeMove Azure resources to a new resource group or subscription.
Lock resource groups
Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources like an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource.
Open the resource group that you want to lock. For more information, seeOpen resource groups.
Open the resource group that you want to lock. For more information, seeOpen resource groups.
In the left pane, selectLocks.
