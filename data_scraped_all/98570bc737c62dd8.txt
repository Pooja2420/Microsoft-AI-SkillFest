Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. Metric alert rules create an alert when a metric value from an Azure resource exceeds a threshold.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create a metric alert rule from metrics explorer
Configure the alert threshold
Create an action group to define notification details
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial you need the following:
An Azure resource to monitor. You can use any resource in your Azure subscription that supports metrics. To determine whether a resource supports metrics, go to its menu in the Azure portal and verify that there's aMetricsoption in theMonitoringsection of the menu.

Create new alert rule
From metrics explorer, clickNew alert rule. The rule will be preconfigured with the target object and the metric that you selected in metrics explorer.

Configure alert logic
The resource will already be selected. You need to modify the signal logic to specify the threshold value and any other details for the alert rule.
To view these settings, select theConditiontab.

The chart shows the value of the selected signal over time so that you can see when the alert would have been fired. This chart will update as you specify the signal logic.

TheAlert logicis defined by the condition and the evaluation time. The alert fires when this condition is true. Provide aThreshold valuefor your alert rule and modify theOperatorandAggregation typeto define the logic you need.

You can accept the default time granularity or modify it to your requirements.Check everydefines how often the alert rule will check if the condition is met.Lookback perioddefines the time interval over which the collected values are aggregated. For example, every 5 minutes, you'll be looking at the past 5 minutes.

When you're done configuring the signal logic, clickNext: Actions >or theActionstab to configure actions.
Configure actions
Action groupsdefine a set of actions to take when an alert is fired such as sending an email or an SMS message.
To configure actions, select theActionstab.

ClickSelect action groupsto add one to the alert rule.

If you don't already have an action group in your subscription to select, then clickCreate action groupto create a new one.

Select aSubscriptionandResource groupfor the action group and give it anAction group namethat will appear in the portal and aDisplay namethat will appear in email and SMS notifications.

Select theNotificationstab and add one or more methods to notify appropriate people when the alert is fired.

Configure details
Select theDetailstab and configure different settings for the alert rule.
Alert rule namewhich should be descriptive since it will be displayed when the alert is fired.
Optionally provide anAlert rule descriptionthat's included in the details of the alert.
SubscriptionandResource groupwhere the alert rule will be stored. This doesn't need to be in the same resource group as the resource that you're monitoring.
Severityfor the alert. The severity allows you to group alerts with a similar relative importance. A severity ofErroris appropriate for an unresponsive virtual machine.
UnderAdvanced options, keep the box checked toEnable upon creation.
UnderAdvanced options, keep the box checked toAutomatically resolve alerts. This will make the alert stateful, which means that the alert is resolved when the condition isn't met anymore.

ClickReview + createand thenCreateto create the alert rule.
View the alert
When an alert fires, it sends any notifications in its action groups. You can also view the alert in the Azure portal.
SelectAlertsfrom the resource's menu. If there are any open alerts for the resources, they are included in the view.

Click on a severity to show the alerts with that severity. Select theUser responseand unselectClosedto view only open alerts.

Click on the name of an alert to view its detail.
