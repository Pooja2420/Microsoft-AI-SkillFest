Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you troubleshoot issues with your disk performance when your application requires higher performance than what you have configured for your VM and disks. For more details about these issues, seeVirtual machine and disk performance.
When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure questions about disk performance, it prompts you to select the VM and disks that are struggling with performance, along with the time period when the problems started. For best results, when specifying a time frame for the analysis, ensure that the disk and VM have been active during that entire period.
Using the information you provide, Copilot in Azure analyses your current configuration and performance metrics to determine whether your application is experiencing slowness due to reaching the configured performance limits for the VM or disk. It then provides a summary of the analysis and recommendations to resolve the performance issue, which you can apply directly in the Azure portal through Copilot in Azure's guided recommendations. The recommendations include a primary recommendation, which will be the least disruptive to your application, along with other possible options. For example, Copilot in Azure might determine that you can improve performance by upgrading your disks, enabling on-demand bursting, or adding another disk to your VM.
To diagnose performance issues when your application requires higher performance than what you have configured for your VM and disks, Copilot in Azure analyzes the followingdisk metrics:
Data Disk IOPS Consumed Percentage
Data Disk Bandwidth Consumed Percentage
OS Disk IOPS Consumed Percentage
OS Disk Bandwidth Consumed Percentage
VM Cached and Uncached IOPS Consumed Percentage
VM Cached and Uncached Bandwidth Percentage
Tip
The tasks and sample prompts listed here show a few of the areas where Microsoft Copilot in Azure can be especially helpful. However, this isn't a complete list of all the things you can do. We encourage you to experiment with your own prompts and see how Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you manage your Azure resources and environment.
Sample prompts
Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to troubleshoot disk performance. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to meet your needs.
"Why is my disk slow?"
"Why is my VM attached to disks running slow?"
"Are there any bottlenecks affecting my disk performance?"
"What are the reasons for my disk's slow performance?"
"Help me with my VM-Disk performance."
Examples
When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure, "Why is my disk slow", Copilot runs an analysis of your disk and VM performance metrics to determine if your application performance is being capped due to requesting more IOPS or throughput than what is allotted for the virtual machines or attached disks. It starts by asking you to select the affected VM.

After you select a VM, you're prompted to select one or more disks for Copilot in Azure to analyze.

Next, tell Copilot in Azure when the issues began. enter an exact or approximate timeframe. For best results, be sure the VM and disk you selected have been active during the period you specify.
Copilot in Azure then shows you the VM and disks you selected and the metrics to be analyzed. After you confirm, Copilot in Azure runs the analysis to determine if your application performance is being capped due to requesting more IOPS or throughput than what is allotted for the virtual machines or attached disks.

If Copilot in Azure detects a performance issue with your VM-Disk configuration due to hitting IOPS or throughput limits, it provides you with a summary of the analysis, a primary recommendation based on the least downtime to your application, and other recommendation options. You can also view metric details from the analysis metrics by selectingShow additional details. This option provides more information such as the VM IOPS/MBPS limits, total time period when limits were hit, and the top three time intervals when disk limits were hit. If your VM has caching enabled, the VM IOPS/MBPS limits shown here reflect your cached limits.
If you choose to enact any of the recommendation options provided by Copilot in Azure, you're directed to the location in the Azure portal where you can implement the recommendation. If you're dissatisfied with the recommendation, you can choose to submit a support request to get more assistance.
