With Azure release pipelines, you can enable manual deployment approvals for each stage in a release pipeline to control your deployment workflow. When you use manual approvals, the deployment is paused at each point where approval is required until the specified approver grants approval, rejects the release, or reassigns the approval to another user.
Deployment approvals
You can set up approvals at the start of a stage (predeployment approvals), at the end of a stage (post-deployment approvals), or for both.
Predeployment approvals
Select your classic release pipeline, and then select thePre-deployment conditionsicon and then select the toggle button to enablePre-deployment approvals.

Note
Azure DevOps doesnât expand Azure Active Directory groups when delivering Notifications. If you must use Azure AD groups, we suggest that you add an email alias as an explicit recipient to your subscription and associate that alias with your AD group, if applicable to your scenario.
Post-deployment approvals
Select your classic release pipeline, and then select thePost-deployment conditionsicon and then select the toggle button to enablePost-deployment approvals.

Approval policies:For added security, you can add this approval policy to prevent the user who requested the release from approving it. If you're experimenting with approvals, uncheck this option so that you can approve or reject your own deployments. SeeHow are the identity variables set?to learn more about identity variables.This policy lets you enforce multifactor authentication in the release approval flow. If this policy is checked, it prompts approvers to re-sign in before approving releases. This feature is only available in Azure DevOps Services for Microsoft Entra backed accounts only.Reduce user workload by automatically approving subsequent prompts if the specified user has already approved the deployment to a previous stage in the pipeline (applies to predeployment approvals only).
