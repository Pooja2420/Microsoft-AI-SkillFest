AKS releases weekly rounds of fixes and feature and component updates that affect all clusters and customers. It's important for you to know when a particular AKS release is hitting your region, and the AKS release tracker provides these details in real time by versions and regions.
Overview
With AKS release tracker, you can follow specific component updates present in an AKS version release, such as fixes shipped to a core add-on, and node image updates for Azure Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows. The tracker provides links to the specific version of the AKSrelease notesto help you identify relevant release instances. Real time data updates allow you to track the release order and status of each region.
