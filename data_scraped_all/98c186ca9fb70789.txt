In this article
This article helps you use Microsoft Sentinel's legacy incident investigation experience. If you're using the newer version of the interface, use the newer set of instructions to match. For more information, seeNavigate and investigate incidents in Microsoft Sentinel.
After connecting your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you want to be notified when something suspicious happens. To enable you to do this, Microsoft Sentinel lets you create advanced analytics rules that generate incidents that you can assign and investigate.
An incident can include multiple alerts. It's an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for a specific investigation. An incident is created based on analytics rules that you created in theAnalyticspage. The properties related to the alerts, such as severity and status, are set at the incident level. After you let Microsoft Sentinel know what kinds of threats you're looking for and how to find them, you can monitor detected threats by investigating incidents.

Use the investigation graph to deep dive
The investigation graph enables analysts to ask the right questions for each investigation. The investigation graph helps you understand the scope, and identify the root cause, of a potential security threat by correlating relevant data with any involved entity. You can dive deeper and investigate any entity presented in the graph by selecting it and choosing between different expansion options.
The investigation graph provides you with:
Visual context from raw data: The live, visual graph displays entity relationships extracted automatically from the raw data. This enables you to easily see connections across different data sources.

Similar incidents (preview)
As a security operations analyst, when investigating an incident you want to pay attention to its larger context. For example, you'll want to see if other incidents like this have happened before or are happening now.
You might want to identify concurrent incidents that might be part of the same larger attack strategy.

Thesimilar incidentstab in the incident details page, now in preview, presents up to 20 other incidents that are the most similar to the current one. Similarity is calculated by internal Microsoft Sentinel algorithms, and the incidents are sorted and displayed in descending order of similarity.

Similarity calculation
There are three criteria by which similarity is determined:
Similar entities:An incident is considered similar to another incident if they both include the sameentities. The more entities two incidents have in common, the more similar they're considered to be.

Similar rule:An incident is considered similar to another incident if they were both created by the sameanalytics rule.

Similar alert details:An incident is considered similar to another incident if they share the same title, product name, and/orcustom details.
Similar alert details:An incident is considered similar to another incident if they share the same title, product name, and/orcustom details.
The reasons an incident appears in the similar incidents list are displayed in theSimilarity reasoncolumn. Hover over the info icon to show the common items (entities, rule name, or details).

Incident similarity is calculated based on data from the 14 days prior to the last activity in the incident, that being the end time of the most recent alert in the incident.
Incident similarity is recalculated every time you enter the incident details page, so the results might vary between sessions if new incidents were created or updated.
Comment on incidents
As a security operations analyst, when investigating an incident you'll want to thoroughly document the steps you take, both to ensure accurate reporting to management and to enable seamless cooperation and collaboration among coworkers. Microsoft Sentinel gives you a rich commenting environment to help you accomplish this.
Another important thing that you can do with comments is enrich your incidents automatically. When you run a playbook on an incident that fetches relevant information from external sources (say, checking a file for malware at VirusTotal), you can have the playbook place the external source's response - along with any other information you define - in the incident's comments.
Comments are simple to use. You access them through theCommentstab on the incident details page.

Frequently asked questions about incident comments
There are several considerations to take into account when using incident comments. The following list of questions points to these considerations.
Text:Comments in Microsoft Sentinel support text inputs in plain text, basic HTML, and Markdown. You can also paste copied text, HTML, and Markdown into the comment window.

Close an incident
Once you resolve a particular incident (for example, when your investigation has reached its conclusion), you should set the incidentâs status toClosed. When you do so, you'll be asked to classify the incident by specifying the reason you're closing it. This step is mandatory. SelectSelect classificationand choose one of the following from the drop-down list:
True Positive - suspicious activity
Benign Positive - suspicious but expected
False Positive - incorrect alert logic
False Positive - incorrect data
Undetermined

For more information about false positives and benign positives, seeHandle false positives in Microsoft Sentinel.
After choosing the appropriate classification, add some descriptive text in theCommentfield. This is useful in the event you need to refer back to this incident. SelectApplywhen youâre done, and the incident is closed.

Search for incidents
To find a specific incident quickly, enter a search string in the search box above the incidents grid and pressEnterto modify the list of incidents shown accordingly. If your incident isn't included in the results, you might want to narrow your search by usingAdvanced searchoptions.
To modify the search parameters, select theSearchbutton and then select the parameters where you want to run your search.
For example:

By default, incident searches run across theIncident ID,Title,Tags,Owner, andProduct namevalues only. In the search pane, scroll down the list to select one or more other parameters to search, and selectApplyto update the search parameters. SelectSet to defaultreset the selected parameters to the default option.
Note
Searches in theOwnerfield support both names and email addresses.
Using advanced search options changes the search behavior as follows:
As long as only the default parameters are selected, the button is grey.
As soon as different parameters are selected, such as advanced search parameters, the button turns blue.
Tip
If you're unable to find the incident you're looking for, remove search parameters to expand your search. If your search results in too many items, add more filters to narrow down your results.
