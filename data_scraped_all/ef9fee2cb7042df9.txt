This article provides an overview of the assessment options available by Update Manager.
Update Manager provides you with the flexibility to assess the status of available updates and manage the process of installing required updates for your machines.
Periodic assessment
Periodic assessment is an update setting on a machine that allows you to enable automatic periodic checking of updates by Update Manager. We recommend that you enable this property on your machines as it allows Update Manager to fetch latest updates for your machines every 24 hours and enables you to view the latest compliance status of your machines. You can enable this setting using update settings flow as detailedhereor enable it at scale by usingPolicy. Learn more onAzure VM extensions.

Note
For Arc-enabled servers, ensure that the subscription in which the Arc-server is onboarded is registered to Microsoft.Compute resource provider. For more information on how to register to the resource provider, seeAzure resource providers and types.
Assessments retrieve the latest updates only for Azure Virtual Machines in theRunningstate. Machines in theStoppedorStopped (deallocated)states are not scanned for missing updates.
Check for updates now/On-demand assessment
Update Manager allows you to check for latest updates on your machines at any time, on-demand. You can view the latest update status and act accordingly. Go toUpdatesblade on any VM and selectCheck for updatesor select multiple machines from Update Manager and check for updates for all machines at once. For more information, seecheck and install on-demand updates.
Update assessment scan
You can initiate a software updates compliance scan on a machine to get a current list of operating system updates available.
On Windows- the software update scan is performed by the Windows Update Agent.
On Linux-  The software update scan is performed using the package manager that returns the missing updates as per the configured repositories.
In theUpdatespage, after you initiate an assessment, a notification is generated to inform you the activity has started and another is displayed when it's finished.

TheRecommended updatessection is updated to reflect the OS updates applicable. You can also selectRefreshto update the information on the page and review the assessment details of the selected machine.
In theHistorysection, you can view:
Total deploymentsâthe total number of deployments.
Failed deploymentsâthe number out of the total deployments that failed.
Successful deploymentsâthe number out of the total deployments that were successful.
A list of the deployments created are shown in the update deployment grid and include relevant information about the deployment. Every update deployment has a unique GUID, represented asActivity ID, which is listed along withStatus,Updates Installed, andTime details. You can filter the results listed in the grid in the following ways:
Select one of the tile visualizations
Select a specific time period. Options are:Last 30 Days,Last 15 Days,Last 7 Days, andLast 24 hrs. By default, deployments from the last 30 days are shown.
Select a specific deployment status. Options are:Succeeded,Failed,CompletedWithWarnings,InProgress, andNotStarted. By default, all status types are selected.
Selecting any one of the update deployments from the list will open theAssessment runpage. Here, it shows a detailed breakdown of the updates and the installation results for the Azure VM or Arc-enabled server.
In theSchedulingsection, you can eithercreate a maintenance configurationorattach existing maintenance configuration. See the section for more information onhow to create a maintenance configurationandhow to attach existing maintenance configuration.
