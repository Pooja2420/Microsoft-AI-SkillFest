Applies to: Azure Local 2311.2 and later
This article explains how to use Insights to monitor multiple Azure Local systems. For a single Azure Local system, seeMonitor a single Azure Local system with Insights.
For information about the benefits, prerequisites, and how to enable Insights on each Azure Local system, seeBenefits,Prerequisites, andEnable Insights.
To monitor multiple Azure Local system with Insights, you need to enable Insights on each system individually. Instead, you can enable Insights at scale using Azure policies. For more information, seeEnable Insights for Azure Local at scale using Azure policies.
Watch the video for a quick introduction:
View health, performance, and usage insights
Insights stores its data in a Log Analytics workspace, which allows it to deliver powerful aggregation and filtering and analyze data trends over time. There's no direct cost for Insights. Users are billed based on the amount of data ingested and the data retention settings of their Log Analytics workspace.
You can access Insights fromAzure Monitor>Insights>Azure Local. Use the following tabs to toggle between views:Add to monitoring,Cluster health,Nodes,Virtual machines, andStorage.
Filtering results
The visualization can be filtered across subscriptions. You can filter the results based on the following drop-down menus:
Time range:This filter allows you to select a range for trend view. The default value isLast 24 hours.
Subscriptions:Shows the subscriptions that have registered Azure Local clusters. You can select multiple subscriptions in this filter.
Clusters:Lists the registered Azure Local clusters that have Logs and Monitoring capabilities enabled in the selected time range. You can select multiple clusters from this filter.
Resource groups:This filter allows you to select all the clusters within a resource group.
Add to monitoring
This feature provides details of clusters that aren't monitored by the user. To start monitoring a cluster, select it to open that cluster, and then selectCapabilities > Insights. If you don't see your cluster, make sure it has recently connected to Azure.

By default, the grid view shows the first 250 rows. You can set the value by editing the grid rows as shown in the following image:

You can export the details in Excel by selectingExport to Excelas shown in the following image:

Excel will provide Azure connection status as follows:
0: Not Registered
1: Disconnected
2: Not Recently
3: Connected
Cluster health
This view provides an overview of the health of clusters.

If your cluster is missing or showing the statusOther, go to theLog Analytics workspaceused for the cluster and make sure that theAgent configurationis capturing data from
themicrosoft-windows-health/operationallog. Also make sure the clusters have connected recently to Azure, and check that the clusters aren't filtered out in this workbook.
This view provides an overview of node health and performance, and usage of selected clusters. This view is built using theserver event ID 3000of the Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational Windows Event Log Channel. Each row can be further expanded to see the node health status. You can interact with the cluster and the node resource to navigate to the respective resource page.

This view provides the state of all the VMs in the selected cluster. The view is built using thevirtual machine event ID 3003of the Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational Windows Event Log Channel. Each row can be further expanded to view the distribution of VMs across nodes in the cluster. You can interact with the cluster and node resource to navigate to the respective resource page.

This view shows the health of volumes, usage, and performance across monitored clusters. Expand a cluster to see the state of individual
volumes. This view is built using thevolume event ID 3002of the Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational Windows Event Log Channel. The tiles on the top provide an overview of the health of storage.

Customize Insights
Because the user experience is built on top of Azure Monitor workbook templates, users can edit the visualizations and queries and save them as a customized workbook.
If you're using the visualization fromAzure Monitor > Insights hub > Azure Local, selectCustomize > Edit > Save Asto save a copy of your modified version to a custom workbook.
Workbooks are saved within a resource group. Everyone with access to the resource group can access the customized workbook.
Most queries are written using Kusto Query Language (KQL). Some queries are written using the Resource Graph Query. For more information, see the following articles:
Azure Monitor Workbooks
Getting started with Kusto
Starter Resource Graph query samples
Support
To open a support ticket for Insights, use the service typeInsights for Azure LocalunderMonitoring & Management.
Event Log Channel
Insights and monitoring views are based on Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational Windows Event Log Channel. When monitoring is enabled, the data from this channel is saved to a Log Analytics workspace.
Viewing and changing the dump cache interval
The default interval to dump the cache is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
Use the following PowerShell cmdlets to view the cache dump interval value:
Get-ClusterResource "sddc management" | Get-ClusterParameter
Get-ClusterResource "sddc management" | Get-ClusterParameter
Use the following cmdlets to change the frequency of cache dump. If set to 0 it will stop publishing events:
Get-ClusterResource "sddc management" | Set-ClusterParameter -Name CacheDumpIntervalInSeconds -Value <value in seconds>
Get-ClusterResource "sddc management" | Set-ClusterParameter -Name CacheDumpIntervalInSeconds -Value <value in seconds>
Windows events in the log channel
This channel includes five events. Each event has cluster name and Azure Resource Manager ID as EventData.
