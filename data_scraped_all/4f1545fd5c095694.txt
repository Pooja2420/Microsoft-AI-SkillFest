Server-side encryption (SSE) protects your data and helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. SSE automatically encrypts your data stored on managed disks in Azure (OS and data disks) at rest by default when persisting it to the cloud. Learn more aboutDisk Encryptionon Azure.
Within DevTest Labs, all OS disks and data disks created as part of a lab are encrypted using platform-managed keys. However, as a lab owner you can choose to encrypt lab virtual machine disks using your own keys. If you choose to manage encryption with your own keys, you can specify acustomer-managed keyto use for encrypting data in lab disks. To learn more on Server-side encryption (SSE) with customer-managed keys, and other managed disk encryption types, seeCustomer-managed keys. Also, seerestrictions with using customer-managed keys.
Note
The setting applies to newly created disks in the lab. If you choose to change the disk encryption set at some point, older disks in the lab will continue to remain encrypted using the previous disk encryption set.
The following section shows how a lab owner can set up encryption using a customer-managed key.
Pre-requisites
If you donât have a disk encryption set, follow this article toset up a Key Vault and a Disk Encryption Set. Note the following requirements for the disk encryption set:The disk encryption set needs to bein same region and subscription as your lab.Ensure you (lab owner) have at least areader-level accessto the disk encryption set that will be used to encrypt lab disks.

Ensure you (lab owner) have at least areader-level accessto the disk encryption set that will be used to encrypt lab disks.
For labs created prior to 8/1/2020, lab owner will need to ensure lab system assigned identity is enabled. To do so, lab owner can go to their lab, click onConfiguration and policies, click onIdentity (Preview)blade, change System Assigned identityStatustoOnand click onSave. For new labs created after 8/1/2020 lab's system assigned identity will be enabled by default.

For new labs created after 8/1/2020 lab's system assigned identity will be enabled by default.

For the lab to handle encryption for all the lab disks, lab owner needs to explicitly grant the labâssystem-assigned identityreader role on the disk encryption set as well as virtual machine contributor role on the underlying Azure subscription. The lab owner can do so by completing the following steps:Ensure you are a member ofUser Access Administrator roleat the Azure subscription level so that you can manage user access to Azure resources.On theDisk Encryption Setpage, assign at least the Reader role to the lab name for which the disk encryption set will be used.For detailed steps, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal.Navigate to theSubscriptionpage in the Azure portal.Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the lab name (system-assigned identity for the lab).

How to validate if disks are being encrypted
Go to a lab virtual machine created after enabling disk encryption with a customer managed key on the lab.
