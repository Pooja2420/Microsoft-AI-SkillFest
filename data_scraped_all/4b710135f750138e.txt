Share packages
To share your packages publicly, you can simply share your feed URL E.g.https://dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT-NAME>/_artifacts/feed/<FEED_NAME>or share individual packages withpackage badges.
https://dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT-NAME>/_artifacts/feed/<FEED_NAME>
As long as your project is kept public, anyone can view and download packages from your public feed. Anonymous users won't be able to create new feeds or access the recycle bin.
