azcopy_bench
azcopy bench
Performs a performance benchmark
Synopsis
Runs a performance benchmark by uploading or downloading test data to or from a specified destination.
For uploads, the test data is automatically generated.
The benchmark command runs the same process as 'copy', except that:
Instead of requiring both source and destination parameters, benchmark takes just one. This is the
blob or Data Lake Storage container, or an Azure Files Share that you want to upload to or download from.
Instead of requiring both source and destination parameters, benchmark takes just one. This is the
blob or Data Lake Storage container, or an Azure Files Share that you want to upload to or download from.
The 'mode' parameter describes whether AzCopy should test uploads to or downloads from given target. Valid values are 'Upload'
and 'Download'. Default value is 'Upload'.
The 'mode' parameter describes whether AzCopy should test uploads to or downloads from given target. Valid values are 'Upload'
and 'Download'. Default value is 'Upload'.
For upload benchmarks, the payload is described by command line parameters, which control how many files are auto-generated and
how big they are. The generation process takes place entirely in memory. Disk is not used.

For downloads, the payload consists of whichever files already exist at the source. (See example below about how to generate
test files if needed).

Only a few of the optional parameters that are available to the copy command are supported.

For uploads, the default behavior is to delete the transferred data at the end of the test run.  For downloads, the data
is never actually saved locally.

Benchmark mode will automatically tune itself to the number of parallel TCP connections that gives
the maximum throughput. It will display that number at the end. To prevent auto-tuning, set the
AZCOPY_CONCURRENCY_VALUE environment variable to a specific number of connections.
All the usual authorization types are supported. However, the most convenient approach for benchmarking upload is typically
to create an empty container with a SAS token and use SAS authorization. (Download mode requires a set of test data to be
present in the target container.)

Examples
Run an upload benchmark with default parameters (suitable for benchmarking networks up to 1 Gbps):'

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]"

Run an upload benchmark with a specified block size of 2 MiB and check the length of files after transfer:

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --block-size-mb 2 --check-length

Run a benchmark test that uploads 500 files, each 500 MiB in size, with a log level set to only display errors:

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 500 --size-per-file 500M --log-level ERROR

Run a benchmark test that uploads 100 files, each 2 GiB in size: (suitable for benchmarking on a fast network, e.g. 10 Gbps):'

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]" --file-count 100 --size-per-file 2G

Same as above, but use 50,000 files, each 8 MiB in size and compute their MD5 hashes (in the same way that the --put-md5 flag does this
in the copy command). The purpose of --put-md5 when benchmarking is to test whether MD5 computation affects throughput for the 
selected file count and size:

   - azcopy bench --mode='Upload' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]" --file-count 50000 --size-per-file 8M --put-md5

Run a benchmark test that uploads 1000 files, each 100 KiB in size, and creates folders to divide up the data:

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --file-count 1000 --size-per-file 100K --number-of-folders 5
 
Run a benchmark test that downloads existing files from a target

   - azcopy bench --mode='Download' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]"

Run a download benchmark with the default parameters and cap the transfer rate at 500 Mbps:

   - azcopy bench --mode=Download "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --cap-mbps 500

Run an upload that does not delete the transferred files. (These files can then serve as the payload for a download test)

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]" --file-count 100 --delete-test-data=false

Run a benchmark test that downloads existing files from a target

   - azcopy bench --mode='Download' "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]"

Run a download benchmark with the default parameters and cap the transfer rate at 500 Mbps:

   - azcopy bench --mode=Download "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?<SAS>" --cap-mbps 500

Run an upload that does not delete the transferred files. (These files can then serve as the payload for a download test)

   - azcopy bench "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]" --file-count 100 --delete-test-data=false
Options
--blob-type string         Defines the type of blob at the destination. Used to allow benchmarking different blob types. Identical to the same-named parameter in the copy command (default "Detect")
      --block-size-mb float      Use this block size (specified in MiB). The default is automatically calculated based on file size. Decimal fractions are allowed - e.g. 0.25. Identical to the same-named parameter in the copy command
      --check-length             Check the length of a file on the destination after the transfer. If there is a mismatch between source and destination, the transfer is marked as failed. (default true)
      --delete-test-data         If true, then the benchmark data will be deleted at the end of the benchmark run.  Set it to false if you want to keep the data at the destination - e.g. to use it for manual tests outside benchmark mode (default true)
      --file-count uint          Number of auto-generated data files to use (default 100)
  -h, --help                     help for bench
      --mode string              Defines if AzCopy should test uploads or downloads from this target. Valid values are 'upload' and 'download'. Defaulted option is 'upload'. (default "upload")

      --put-blob-size-mb float   Use this size (specified in MiB) as a threshold to determine whether to upload a blob as a single PUT request when uploading to Azure Storage. The default value is automatically calculated based on file size. Decimal fractions are allowed (For example: 0.25).
      --put-md5                  Create an MD5 hash of each file, and save the hash as the Content-MD5 property of the destination blob/file. (By default the hash is NOT created.) Identical to the same-named parameter in the copy command

--cap-mbps float                      Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.
      --log-level string                    Define the log verbosity for the log file, available levels: DEBUG(detailed trace), INFO(all requests/responses), WARNING(slow responses), ERROR(only failed requests), and NONE(no output logs). (default 'INFO'). (default "INFO")
      --output-level string                 Define the output verbosity. Available levels: essential, quiet. (default "default")
      --output-type string                  Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")
      --skip-version-check                  Do not perform the version check at startup. Intended for automation scenarios & airgapped use.
      --trusted-microsoft-suffixes string   Specifies additional domain suffixes where Azure Active Directory login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net;*.storage.azure.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
