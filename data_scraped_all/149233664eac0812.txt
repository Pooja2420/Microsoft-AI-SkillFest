Azure is continually expanding the number of services that supportavailability zones, including both zonal and zone-redundant offerings. This article shows you which services support availability zones, as well as the type of offering they support.
Azure services with availability zone support
The following table provides a list of zonal and zone-redundant Azure services. Some services support both types of deployments. To learn more about zonal and zone-redundant services and how they work, seeTypes of availability zone support.
Some Azure services arenonregional, which means that you don't deploy the service into a specific Azure region or configure availability zone support. To learn more, seeNonregional Azure services.
Important
Even though some services might support availability zones, they might have specific requirements to use them on your resources. For example, some may only support availability zones for certain tiers or regions. To get more information on a service's requirements for availability zone support, select that service in the following table.
