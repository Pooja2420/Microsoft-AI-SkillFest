In addition to the default domain that is included in an instance of Azure Web PubSub, you can add a custom domain. A custom domain is a domain name that you own and manage. You can use a custom domain to access your Web PubSub resources. For example, you can usecontoso.example.cominstead ofcontoso.webpubsub.azure.comto access your resources.
contoso.example.com
contoso.webpubsub.azure.com
Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, you cancreate an account for free.
An Azure Web PubSub resource at a minimum Premium tier.
An Azure Key Vault resource.
A custom certificate matching custom domain that is stored in Azure Key Vault.
Add a custom certificate
Before you can add a custom domain, add a matching custom certificate. A custom certificate is a resource of your instance of Web PubSub. It references a certificate in your key vault. For security and compliance, Web PubSub doesn't permanently store your certificate. Instead, it fetches the certificate from your key vault and keeps it in memory.
Access the key vault by using a managed identity
Azure Web PubSub uses a managed identity to access your key vault. To authorize access, it must be granted permissions.
Create a managed identity
In the Azure portal, go to your Web PubSub resource.
In the Azure portal, go to your Web PubSub resource.
On the left menu, selectIdentity.
On the left menu, selectIdentity.
Select the type of identity to use:System assignedorUser assigned.

Give key vault access to the managed identity
Depending on how you configure your Azure Key Vault permissions model, you might need to grant permissions at different locations in the Azure portal.
Key vault access policy
Azure role-based access control
If you use a key vault built-in access policy as a key vault permissions model:

In the Azure portal, go to your key vault.
In the Azure portal, go to your key vault.
On the left menu, selectAccess configuration.

Create a custom certificate

In the Azure portal, go to your Web PubSub resource.
On the left menu, selectCustom domain.
On the left menu, selectCustom domain.
On theCustom certificatepane, selectAdd.
On theCustom certificatepane, selectAdd.

Enter a name for the custom certificate.

Web PubSub fetches the certificate and validates its contents. When certificate validation succeeds,Provisioning Statefor the certificate isSucceeded.

Create a custom domain CNAME
To validate the ownership of your custom domain, create a CNAME record for the custom domain and point it to the default domain of your Web PubSub resource.
For example, if your default domain iscontoso.webpubsub.azure.comand your custom domain iscontoso.example.com, create a CNAME record onexample.comlike in this example:
contoso.webpubsub.azure.com
contoso.example.com
example.com
contoso.example.com. 0 IN CNAME contoso.webpubsub.azure.com
contoso.example.com. 0 IN CNAME contoso.webpubsub.azure.com
If you use Azure DNS Zone, to learn how to add a CNAME record, seeManage DNS records.

If you use other DNS providers, follow guidance in the provider's documentation to create a CNAME record.
Add a custom domain to Web PubSub
A custom domain is another sub resource of your Web PubSub instance. It contains all configurations that are required for a custom domain.
In the Azure portal, go to your Web PubSub resource.
In the Azure portal, go to your Web PubSub resource.
On the left menu, selectCustom domain.
On the left menu, selectCustom domain.
On theCustom domainpane, selectAdd.
On theCustom domainpane, selectAdd.

Enter a name for the custom domain. Use the sub resource name.

Enter the domain name. Use the full domain name of your custom domain, for example,contoso.com.
Enter the domain name. Use the full domain name of your custom domain, for example,contoso.com.
contoso.com
Select a custom certificate that applies to this custom domain.
Select a custom certificate that applies to this custom domain.
SelectAdd.
SelectAdd.

Verify your custom domain
You can now access your Web PubSub endpoint by using the custom domain.
To verify the domain, you can access the Health API. The following examples use cURL.
PowerShell
Bash
PS C:\> curl.exe -v https://contoso.example.com/api/health
...
> GET /api/health HTTP/1.1
> Host: contoso.example.com

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
PS C:\>
PS C:\> curl.exe -v https://contoso.example.com/api/health
...
> GET /api/health HTTP/1.1
> Host: contoso.example.com

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
PS C:\>
$ curl -vvv https://contoso.example.com/api/health
...
*  SSL certificate verify ok.
...
> GET /api/health HTTP/2
> Host: contoso.example.com
...
< HTTP/2 200
...
$ curl -vvv https://contoso.example.com/api/health
...
*  SSL certificate verify ok.
...
> GET /api/health HTTP/2
> Host: contoso.example.com
...
< HTTP/2 200
...
The Health API should return a200status code without any certificate errors.
200
Configure a private network key vault
If you configure aprivate endpointto your key vault, Web PubSub can't access the key vault by using a public network. You must set up ashared private endpointto give Web PubSub access to your key vault via a private network.
After you create a shared private endpoint, you can create a custom certificate as usual. Youdon't have to change the domain in the key vault URI. For example, if your key vault base URI ishttps://contoso.vault.azure.net, continue to use this URI to configure a custom certificate.
https://contoso.vault.azure.net
You don't have to explicitly allow Web PubSub IP addresses in your key vault firewall settings. For more information, seeKey vault private link diagnostics.
Rotate the certificate
If you don't specify a secret version when you create a custom certificate, Web PubSub periodically checks for the latest version in the key vault. When a new version is detected, it's automatically applied. The delay is typically less than an hour.
Alternatively, you can pin a custom certificate to a specific secret version in your key vault. When you need to apply a new certificate, you can edit the secret version, and then update the custom certificate proactively.
