Column names noted byextendthat already exist in the input are removed
and appended as their new calculated values.
extend
Column names noted byextendthat don't exist in the input are appended
as their new calculated values.
extend
Note
Theextendoperator adds a new column to the input result set, which doesnothave an index. In most cases, if the new column is set to be exactly
the same as an existing table column that has an index, Kusto can automatically
use the existing index. However, in some complex scenarios this propagation is
not done. In such cases, if the goal is to rename a column, use theproject-renameoperatorinstead.
extend
project-rename
Example
Run the query
StormEvents
| project EndTime, StartTime
| extend Duration = EndTime - StartTime
StormEvents
| project EndTime, StartTime
| extend Duration = EndTime - StartTime
The following table shows only the first 10 results. To see the full output, run the query.
