Important
The content filtering system isn't applied to prompts and completions processed by the audio models such as Whisper in Azure OpenAI Service. Learn more about theAudio models in Azure OpenAI.
Azure OpenAI Service includes a content filtering system that works alongside core models, including image generation models. This system works by running both the prompt and completion through an ensemble of classification models designed to detect and prevent the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Variations in API configurations and application design might affect completions and thus filtering behavior.
The text content filtering models for the hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm categories have been specifically trained and tested on the following languages: English, German, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese. However, the service can work in many other languages, but the quality might vary. In all cases, you should do your own testing to ensure that it works for your application.
In addition to the content filtering system, Azure OpenAI Service performs monitoring to detect content and/or behaviors that suggest use of the service in a manner that might violate applicable product terms. For more information about understanding and mitigating risks associated with your application, see theTransparency Note for Azure OpenAI. For more information about how data is processed for content filtering and abuse monitoring, seeData, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service.
The following sections provide information about the content filtering categories, the filtering severity levels and their configurability, and API scenarios to be considered in application design and implementation.
Note
No prompts or completions are stored for the purposes of content filtering. No prompts or completions are used to train, retrain, or improve the content filtering system without your consent. For more information, seeData, privacy, and security.
Content filter types
The content filtering system integrated in the Azure OpenAI Service contains:
Neural multi-class classification models aimed at detecting and filtering harmful content; the models cover four categories (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm) across four severity levels (safe, low, medium, and high). Content detected at the 'safe' severity level is labeled in annotations but isn't subject to filtering and isn't configurable.
Other optional classification models aimed at detecting jailbreak risk and known content for text and code; these models are binary classifiers that flag whether user or model behavior qualifies as a jailbreak attack or match to known text or source code. The use of these models is optional, but use of protected material code model may be required for Customer Copyright Commitment coverage.

Configurability
Azure OpenAI Service includes default safety settings applied to all models, excluding audio API models such as Whisper. These configurations provide you with a responsible experience by default, including content filtering models, blocklists, prompt transformation,content credentials, and others.Read more about it here.
All customers can also configure content filters and create custom safety policies that are tailored to their use case requirements. The configurability feature allows customers to adjust the settings, separately for prompts and completions, to filter content for each content category at different severity levels as described in the table below. Content detected at the 'safe' severity level is labeled in annotations but is not subject to filtering and isn't configurable.
1For Azure OpenAI models, only customers who have been approved for modified content filtering have full content filtering control and can turn off content filters. Apply for modified content filters via this form:Azure OpenAI Limited Access Review: Modified Content Filters. For Azure Government customers, apply for modified content filters via this form:Azure Government - Request Modified Content Filtering for Azure OpenAI Service.
Configurable content filters for inputs (prompts) and outputs (completions) are available for all Azure OpenAI models.
Content filtering configurations are created within a Resource in Azure AI Foundry portal, and can be associated with Deployments.Learn more about configurability here.
Customers are responsible for ensuring that applications integrating Azure OpenAI comply with theCode of Conduct.
Scenario details
When the content filtering system detects harmful content, you receive either an error on the API call if the prompt was deemed inappropriate, or thefinish_reasonon the response will becontent_filterto signify that some of the completion was filtered. When building your application or system, you'll want to account for these scenarios where the content returned by the Completions API is filtered, which might result in content that is incomplete. How you act on this information will be application specific. The behavior can be summarized in the following points:
finish_reason
content_filter
Prompts that are classified at a filtered category and severity level will return an HTTP 400 error.
Non-streaming completions calls won't return any content when the content is filtered. Thefinish_reasonvalue is set to content_filter. In rare cases with longer responses, a partial result can be returned. In these cases, thefinish_reasonis updated.
finish_reason
finish_reason
For streaming completions calls, segments are returned back to the user as they're completed. The service continues streaming until either reaching a stop token, length, or when content that is classified at a filtered category and severity level is detected.
Scenario: You send a non-streaming completions call asking for multiple outputs; no content is classified at a filtered category and severity level

Annotations
Content filters
When annotations are enabled as shown in the code snippet below, the following information is returned via the API for the categories hate and fairness, sexual, violence, and self-harm:
content filtering category (hate, sexual, violence, self_harm)
the severity level (safe, low, medium, or high) within each content category
filtering status (true or false).
Optional models
Optional models can be enabled in annotate (returns information when content was flagged, but not filtered) or filter mode (returns information when content was flagged and filtered).
When annotations are enabled as shown in the code snippets below, the following information is returned by the API for optional models:
completion_end_offset
completion_start_offset
When displaying code in your application, we strongly recommend that the application also displays the example citation from the annotations. Compliance with the cited license may also be required for Customer Copyright Commitment coverage.

Document embedding in prompts
A key aspect of Azure OpenAI's Responsible AI measures is the content safety system. This system runs alongside the core GPT model to monitor any irregularities in the model input and output. Its performance is improved when it can differentiate between various elements of your prompt like system input, user input, and AI assistant's output.
For enhanced detection capabilities, prompts should be formatted according to the following recommended methods.
Chat Completions API
The Chat Completion API is structured by definition. It consists of a list of messages, each with an assigned role.
The safety system parses this structured format and applies the following behavior:
On the latest âuserâ content, the following categories of RAI Risks will be detected:HateSexualViolenceSelf-HarmPrompt shields (optional)
Hate
Sexual
Violence
Self-Harm
Prompt shields (optional)
This is an example message array:
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "Example question goes here."}, 
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Example answer goes here."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "First question/message for the model to actually respond to."}
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "Example question goes here."}, 
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Example answer goes here."}, 
{"role": "user", "content": "First question/message for the model to actually respond to."}
Embedding documents in your prompt
In addition to detection on last user content, Azure OpenAI also supports the detection of specific risks inside context documents via Prompt Shields â Indirect Prompt Attack Detection. You should identify parts of the input that are a document (for example, retrieved website, email, etc.) with the following document delimiter.
\"\"\" <documents> *insert your document content here* </documents> \"\"\"
\"\"\" <documents> *insert your document content here* </documents> \"\"\"
When you do so, the following options are available for detection on tagged documents:
On each tagged âdocumentâ content, detect the following categories:Indirect attacks (optional)
Indirect attacks (optional)
Here's an example chat completion messages array:
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model.}, 

{"role": "user", "content": "First question/message for the model to actually respond to, including document context.  \"\"\" <documents>\n*insert your document content here*\n</documents> \"\"\"""}
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model.}, 

{"role": "user", "content": "First question/message for the model to actually respond to, including document context.  \"\"\" <documents>\n*insert your document content here*\n</documents> \"\"\"""}
When you tag unvetted documents for detection, the document content should be JSON-escaped to ensure successful parsing by the Azure OpenAI safety system.
For example, see the following email body:
Hello JosÃ¨, 

I hope this email finds you well today.
Hello JosÃ¨, 

I hope this email finds you well today.
With JSON escaping, it would read:
Hello Jos\u00E9,\nI hope this email finds you well today.
Hello Jos\u00E9,\nI hope this email finds you well today.
The escaped text in a chat completion context would read:
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model, including document context. \"\"\" <documents>\n Hello Jos\\u00E9,\\nI hope this email finds you well today. \n</documents> \"\"\""}, 

{"role": "user", "content": "First question/message for the model to actually respond to."}
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model, including document context. \"\"\" <documents>\n Hello Jos\\u00E9,\\nI hope this email finds you well today. \n</documents> \"\"\""}, 

{"role": "user", "content": "First question/message for the model to actually respond to."}
Content streaming
This section describes the Azure OpenAI content streaming experience and options. Customers can receive content from the API as it's generated, instead of waiting for chunks of content that have been verified to pass your content filters.
Default
The content filtering system is integrated and enabled by default for all customers. In the default streaming scenario, completion content is buffered, the content filtering system runs on the buffered content, and â depending on the content filtering configuration â content is either returned to the user if it doesn't violate the content filtering policy (Microsoft's default or a custom user configuration), or itâs immediately blocked and returns a content filtering error, without returning the harmful completion content. This process is repeated until the end of the stream. Content is fully vetted according to the content filtering policy before it's returned to the user. Content isn't returned token-by-token in this case, but in âcontent chunksâ of the respective buffer size.
Asynchronous Filter
Customers can choose the Asynchronous Filter as an extra option, providing a new streaming experience. In this case, content filters are run asynchronously, and completion content is returned immediately with a smooth token-by-token streaming experience. No content is buffered, which allows for a fast streaming experience with zero latency associated with content safety.
Customers must understand that while the feature improves latency, it's a trade-off against the safety and real-time vetting of smaller sections of model output. Because content filters are run asynchronously, content moderation messages and policy violation signals are delayed, which means some sections of harmful content that would otherwise have been filtered immediately could be displayed to the user.
Annotations: Annotations and content moderation messages are continuously returned during the stream. We strongly recommend you consume annotations in your app and implement other AI content safety mechanisms, such as redacting content or returning other safety information to the user.
Content filtering signal: The content filtering error signal is delayed. If there is a policy violation, itâs returned as soon as itâs available, and the stream is stopped. The content filtering signal is guaranteed within a ~1,000-character window of the policy-violating content.
Customer Copyright Commitment: Content that is retroactively flagged as protected material may not be eligible for Customer Copyright Commitment coverage.
To enable Asynchronous Filter inAzure AI Foundry portal, follow theContent filter how-to guideto create a new content filtering configuration, and selectAsynchronous Filterin the Streaming section.

The text field will always be an empty string, indicating no new tokens. Annotations will only be relevant to already-sent tokens. There may be multiple annotation messages referring to the same tokens.
"start_offset"and"end_offset"are low-granularity offsets in text (with 0 at beginning of prompt) to mark which text the annotation is relevant to.
"start_offset"
"end_offset"
"check_offset"represents how much text has been fully moderated. It's an exclusive lower bound on the"end_offset"values of future annotations. It's non-decreasing.

When content filtering is triggered for a prompt and a"status": 400is received as part of the response there will be a charge for this request as the prompt was evaluated by the service. Due to the asynchronous nature of the content filtering system, a charge for both the prompt and completion tokens will occur.Charges will also occurwhen a"status":200is received with"finish_reason": "content_filter". In this case the prompt did not have any issues, but the completion generated by the model was detected to violate the content filtering rules which results in the completion being filtered.
"status": 400
"status":200
"finish_reason": "content_filter"
Best practices
As part of your application design, consider the following best practices to deliver a positive experience with your application while minimizing potential harms:
Decide how you want to handle scenarios where your users send prompts containing content that is classified at a filtered category and severity level or otherwise misuse your application.
Check thefinish_reasonto see if a completion is filtered.
finish_reason
Check that there's no error object in thecontent_filter_result(indicating that content filters didn't run).
content_filter_result
If you're using the protected material code model in annotate mode, display the citation URL when you're displaying the code in your application.
