In this article, you learn how to enable cost analysis on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to view detailed cost data for cluster resources.
About cost analysis
AKS clusters rely on Azure resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), virtual disks, load balancers, and public IP addresses. Multiple applications can use these resources. The resource consumption patterns often differ for each application, so their contribution toward the total cluster resource cost might also vary. Some applications might have footprints across multiple clusters, which can pose a challenge when performing cost attribution and cost management.
When you enable cost analysis on your AKS cluster, you can view detailed cost allocation scoped to Kubernetes constructs, such as clusters and namespaces, and Azure Compute, Network, and Storage resources. The add-on is built on top ofOpenCost, an open-source Cloud Native Computing Foundation Incubating project for usage data collection. Usage data is reconciled with your Azure invoice data to provide a comprehensive view of your AKS cluster costs directly in the Azure portal Cost Management views.
For more information on Microsoft Cost Management, seeStart analyzing costs in Azure.
After enabling the cost analysis add-on and allowing time for data to be collected, you can use the information inUnderstand AKS usage and coststo help you understand your data.
Prerequisites
Your cluster must use theStandardorPremiumtier, not theFreetier.

To view cost analysis information, you must have one of the following roles on the subscription hosting the cluster:Owner,Contributor,Reader,Cost Management Contributor, orCost Management Reader.

If using the Azure CLI, you need version2.61.0or later installed.
2.61.0
Once you have enabled cost analysis, you can't downgrade your cluster to theFreetier without first disabling cost analysis.

Access to the Azure API including Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API. For a list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) required, seeAKS Cost Analysis required FQDN.
Limitations
Kubernetes cost views are only available for theEnterprise AgreementandMicrosoft Customer AgreementMicrosoft Azure offer types. For more information, seeSupported Microsoft Azure offers.
Currently, virtual nodes aren't supported.
Enable cost analysis on your AKS cluster
You can enable the cost analysis with the--enable-cost-analysisflag during one of the following operations:
--enable-cost-analysis

Enable cost analysis on a new cluster
Enable cost analysis on a new cluster using theaz aks createcommand with the--enable-cost-analysisflag. The following example creates a new AKS cluster in theStandardtier with cost analysis enabled:
az aks create
--enable-cost-analysis
Standard
az aks create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --location <location> --enable-managed-identity --generate-ssh-keys --tier standard --enable-cost-analysis
az aks create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --location <location> --enable-managed-identity --generate-ssh-keys --tier standard --enable-cost-analysis
Enable cost analysis on an existing cluster
Enable cost analysis on an existing cluster using theaz aks updatecommand with the--enable-cost-analysisflag. The following example updates an existing AKS cluster in theStandardtier to enable cost analysis:
az aks update
--enable-cost-analysis
Standard
az aks update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --enable-cost-analysis
az aks update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --enable-cost-analysis
Note
An agent is deployed to the cluster when you enable the add-on. The agent consumes a small amount of CPU and Memory resources.
Warning
The AKS cost analysis add-on Memory usage is dependent on the number of containers deployed. You can roughly approximate Memory consumption using200 MB + 0.5 MB per container. The current Memory limit is set to4 GB, which supports approximately7000 containers per cluster. These estimates are subject to change.
Disable cost analysis on your AKS cluster
Disable cost analysis using theaz aks updatecommand with the--disable-cost-analysisflag.
az aks update
--disable-cost-analysis
az aks update --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --disable-cost-analysis
az aks update --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --disable-cost-analysis
Disabling cost analysis shouldn't affect your existing cluster or workloads. Any existing data collected by the add-on remains in the Azure portal.
Note
If you want to downgrade your cluster from theStandardorPremiumtier to theFreetier while cost analysis is enabled, you must first disable cost analysis.

View the cost data
You can view cost allocation data in the Azure portal. For more information, seeView AKS costs in Microsoft Cost Management.
Cost definitions
In the Kubernetes namespaces and assets views, you might see any of the following charges:
Idle chargesrepresent the cost of available resource capacity that isn't used by any workloads.
Service chargesrepresent the charges associated with the service, like Uptime SLA, Microsoft Defender for Containers, etc.
System chargesrepresent the cost of capacity reserved by AKS on each node to run system processes required by the cluster, including the kubelet and container runtime.Learn more.
Unallocated chargesrepresent the cost of resources that couldn't be allocated to namespaces.
Note
It might takeup to one dayfor data to finalize. After 24 hours, any fluctuations in costs for the previous day will have stabilized.
