This article describes how to perform an on-demand update on a single virtual machine (VM) or multiple VMs by using Azure Update Manager.
See the following sections for more information:
Install updates on a single VM
Install updates at scale
Supported regions
Update Manager is available in allAzure public regions.
Configure reboot settings
The registry keys listed inConfigure automatic updates by editing the registryandRegistry keys used to manage restartcan cause your machines to reboot. A reboot can happen even if you specifyNever Rebootin theSchedulesettings. Configure these registry keys to best suit your environment.
Install updates on a single VM
You can install updates fromOvervieworMachineson theUpdate Managerpage or from the selected VM.
From Overview pane
From Machines pane
From a selected VM
To install one-time updates on a single VM:

On theUpdatespane, specify the updates to include in the deployment. For each product, select or clear all supported update classifications and specify the ones to include in your update deployment.If your deployment is meant to apply only for a select set of updates, it's necessary to clear all the preselected update classifications when you configure theInclusion/exclusionupdates described in the following steps. This action ensures only the updates you've specified to include in this deployment are installed on the target machine.NoteSelected Updatesshows a preview of OS updates that you can install based on the last OS update assessment information available. If the OS update assessment information in Update Manager is obsolete, the actual updates installed would vary. Especially if you've chosen to install a specific update category, where the OS updates applicable might vary as new packages or KB IDs might be available for the category.Update Manager doesn't support driver updates.SelectInclude update classification. Select the appropriate classifications that must be installed on your machines.SelectInclude KB ID/packageto include in the updates. You can add multiple KB IDs and package names. When you add KB ID/package name, the next row appears. The package can have both name and version. For example, use3103696or3134815. For Windows, you can refer to theMSRC webpageto get the details of the latest Knowledge Base release. For supported Linux distros, you specify a comma separated list of packages by the package name, and you can include wildcards. For example, usekernel*,glibc, orlibc=1.0.1. Based on the options specified, Update Manager shows a preview of OS updates under theSelected Updatessection.To exclude updates that you don't want to install, selectExclude KB ID/package. We recommend selecting this option because updates that aren't displayed here might be installed, as newer updates might be available. You can exclude multiple KB IDs and package names.To ensure that the updates published are on or before a specific date, selectInclude by maximum patch publish date. Select the date and selectAdd>Next.

View update history for a single VM
You can browse information about your Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers across your Azure subscriptions. For more information, seeUpdate deployment history.
After your scheduled deployment starts, you can see its status on theHistorytab. It displays the total number of deployments, including the successful and failed deployments.

Currently, theWindows update historyfor a VM doesn't show the updates that are installed from Azure Update Manager. To view a summary of the updates applied on your machines, go toAzure Update Manager>Manage>HistoryinAzure portal.
Note
To view a summary of the updates applied on your machines, go toAzure Update Manager>Manage>HistoryinAzure portal.
Alternatively, go toControl Panel>Programs>Programs and Features>Installed Updatesto view the installed CBS updates. This view only shows history of CBS updatesServicing stack updates - Windows Deploymentwhich can be uninstalled.
A list of the deployments created are shown in the update deployment grid and include relevant information about the deployment. Every update deployment has a unique GUID, represented asOperation ID, which is listed along withStatus,Updates InstalledandTimedetails. You can filter the results listed in the grid.
Select any one of the update deployments from the list to open theUpdate deployment runpage. Here, you can see a detailed breakdown of the updates and the installation results for the Azure VM or Azure Arc-enabled server.

The available values are:
Not attempted: The update wasn't installed because insufficient time was available, based on the defined maintenance window duration.
Not selected: The update wasn't selected for deployment.
Succeeded: The update succeeded.
Failed: The update failed.
