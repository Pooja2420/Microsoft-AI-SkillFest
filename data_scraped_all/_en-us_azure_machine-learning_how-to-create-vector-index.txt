You can use Azure Machine Learning to create a vector index from files or folders on your machine, a location in cloud storage, an Azure Machine Learning data asset, a Git repository, or a SQL database. Azure Machine Learning can currently process .txt, .md, .pdf, .xls, and .docx files. You can also reuse an existing Azure AI Search (formerly Cognitive Search) index instead of creating a new index.
When you create a vector index, Azure Machine Learning chunks the data, creates embeddings, and stores the embeddings in a Faiss index or Azure AI Search index. In addition, Azure Machine Learning creates:
Test data for your data source.
Test data for your data source.
A sample prompt flow, which uses the vector index that you created. Features of the sample prompt flow include:Automatically generated prompt variants.Evaluation of each prompt variant by using thegenerated test data.Metrics against each prompt variant to help you choose the best variant to run.You can use this sample to continue developing your prompt.

Add a vector index to a prompt flow
After you create a vector index, you can add it to a prompt flow from the prompt flow canvas.
Open an existing prompt flow.

Select themlindex_contentvalue box, and select your index. The tool should detect the index created in the "Create a vector index" section of the tutorial. After filling in all the necessary information, select save to close the generate drawer.

Enter the queries and query_types to be performed against the index.An example of a plain string you can input in this case would be:How to use SDK V2?'. Here is an example of an embedding as an input:${embed_the_question.output}`. Passing a plain string will only work when the Vector Index is getting used on the workspace which created it.
