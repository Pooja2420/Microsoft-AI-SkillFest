Azure Virtual Machines (VM) instances go through different states. There areprovisioningandpowerstates. This article describes these states and highlights when customers are billed for instance usage.
Get states using Instance View
The instance view API provides VM running-state information. For more information, seeVirtual Machines - Instance View.
Azure Resources Explorer provides a simple UI for viewing the VM running state:Resource Explorer.
The VM provisioning state is available, in slightly different forms, from within the VM propertiesprovisioningStateand the InstanceView. In the VM InstanceView, there's an element within thestatusarray in the form ofProvisioningState/<state>[/<errorCode>].
provisioningState
status
ProvisioningState/<state>[/<errorCode>]
To retrieve the power state of all the VMs in your subscription, use theVirtual Machines - List All APIwith parameterstatusOnlyset totrue.
statusOnly
true
Note
Virtual Machines - List All APIwith parameterstatusOnlyset totrueretrieves the power states of all VMs in a subscription. However, in some rare situations, the power state may not available due to intermittent issues in the retrieval process. In such situations, we recommend retrying using the same API or usingAzure Resource Healthto check the power state of your VMs.

Power states and billing
The power state represents the last known state of the VM.

The following table provides a description of each instance state and indicates whether that state is billed for instance usage.
PowerOff
* Some Azure resources, such asDisksandNetworkingcontinue to incur charges.
Example of PowerState in JSON:
{
  "code": "PowerState/running",
  "level": "Info",
  "displayStatus": "VM running"
}
{
  "code": "PowerState/running",
  "level": "Info",
  "displayStatus": "VM running"
}
Provisioning states
The provisioning state is the status of a user-initiated, control-plane operation on the VM. These states are separate from the power state of a VM.
OS Provisioning states
OS Provisioning states only apply to virtual machines created with ageneralizedOS image.Specializedimages and disks attached as OS disk don't display these states. The OS provisioning state isn't shown separately. It's a substate of the Provisioning State in the VM InstanceView. For example,ProvisioningState/creating/osProvisioningComplete.
ProvisioningState/creating/osProvisioningComplete

Troubleshooting VM states
