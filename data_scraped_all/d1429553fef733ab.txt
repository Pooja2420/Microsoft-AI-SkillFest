This document lists some of the most common Microsoft Azure limits, which are also sometimes called quotas.
To learn more about Azure pricing, see theAzure pricingoverview and details page.
The Azure pricing page provides details for specific services; for example,Windows Virtual Machines.
You can also use the Azurepricing calculatorto estimate your costs.
SeeWhat is Microsoft Billing?for tips to help manage your costs.
How to manage limits
Note
Some services have adjustable limits.
When the limit can be adjusted, the tables includeDefault limitandMaximum limitheaders. The limit can be raised above the default limit but not above the maximum limit. Some services with adjustable limits use different headers with information about adjusting the limit.
When a service doesn't have adjustable limits, the following tables use the headerLimitwithout any additional information about adjusting the limit. In those cases, the default and the maximum limits are the same.
If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit,open an online customer support request at no charge.
The termssoft limitandhard limitare often used informally to describe the current, adjustable limit (soft limit) and the maximum limit (hard limit). If a limit isn't adjustable, there won't be a soft limit but only a hard limit.
Free Azure trial subscriptionsaren't eligible for limit or quota increases. If you have this type of subscription, you can upgrade to aPay-as-you-goone. For more information, seeUpgrade your Azure accountand the overviews forTry Azure for free or pay as you go.
Some limits are managed at a regional level. You decide what your quotas must be for your workload in any one region, and then request that amount for each region into which you want to deploy.
For example, with virtual central processing unit (vCPU) quotas:
To request a quota increase with support for vCPUs, you decide how many vCPUs to use in which regions.
You then request an increase in vCPU quotas for the amounts and regions that you want.
If you need to use 30 vCPUs in West Europe to run your application there, you specifically request 30 vCPUs in West Europe.
Your vCPU quota doesn't increase in any other region; only West Europe has the 30-vCPU quota.
SeeResolve errors for resource quotasfor more information about how to determine quotas for specific regions.
General limits
SeeNaming rules and restrictions for Azure resourcesfor limits on resource names.
SeeUnderstand how Azure Resource Manager throttles requeststo learn about Resource Manager API read and write limits.
Azure management group limits
The following limits apply toAzure management groups.
1The 6 levels don't include the subscription level.
2If you reach the limit of 800 deployments, delete deployments from the history that are no longer needed. To delete management group level deployments, useRemove-AzManagementGroupDeploymentoraz deployment mg delete.
Azure subscription limits
The following limits apply when you use Azure Resource Manager and Azure resource groups.
1You can apply up to 50 tags directly to a subscription. Within the subscription, each resource or resource group is also limited to 50 tags. However, the subscription can contain an unlimited number of tags that are dispersed across resources and resource groups.
2Resource Manager returns alist of tag name and valuesin the subscription only when the number of unique tags is 80,000 or less. A unique tag is defined by the combination of resource ID, tag name, and tag value. For example, two resources with the same tag name and value would be calculated as two unique tags. You still can find a resource by tag when the number exceeds 80,000.
3Deployments are automatically deleted from the history as you near the limit. For more information, seeAutomatic deletions from deployment history.
Azure resource group limits
1Deployments are automatically deleted from the history as you near the limit. Deleting an entry from the deployment history doesn't affect the deployed resources. For more information, seeAutomatic deletions from deployment history.
You can exceed some template limits by using a nested template. For more information, seeUse linked templates when you deploy Azure resources. To reduce the number of parameters, variables, or outputs, you can combine several values into an object. For more information, seeObjects as parameters.
You may get an error with a template or parameter file of less than 4 MB, if the total size of the request is too large. For more information about how to simplify your template to avoid a large request, seeResolve errors for job size exceeded.
Azure API Center limits
1Free plan provided for 90 days, then service is soft-deleted. Use of full service features including API analysis is limited.2To increase a limit in the Standard plan, contactsupport.3Custom metadata properties assigned to APIs, deployments, and environments.4Process can take a few minutes to up to 24 hours to complete.5Sources such as linked API Management instances.
Azure API Management limits
This section provides information about limits that apply to Azure API Management instances in differentservice tiers, including the following:
API Management classic tiers
API Management v2 tiers
API Management workspaces
Developer portal in API Management v2 tiers
Limits - API Management classic tiers
For certain API Management resources, limits are set only in the Consumption tier; in other API Management classic tiers, where indicated, these resources are unlimited. However, your practical upper limit depends on service configuration including pricing tier, service capacity, number of scale units, policy configuration, API definitions and types, number of concurrent requests, and other factors.
To request a limit increase, create a support request from the Azure portal. For more information, seeAzure support plans.
1Connections are pooled and reused unless explicitly closed by the backend.2Includes an up to 2048-bytes long query string.3The number of nodes (or replicas) associated with a self-hosted gateway resource is unlimited in the Premium tier and capped at a single node in the Developer tier.4Up to a maximum of 60,000 connections per service instance.
Limits - API Management v2 tiers
To request a limit increase, create a support request from the Azure portal. For more information, seeAzure support plans.
1Connections are pooled and reused unless explicitly closed by the backend.2Includes an up to 2048-bytes long query string.3Up to a maximum of 60,000 connections per service instance.
Limits - API Management workspaces
The following are resource limits perworkspacein Azure API Management:
Limits - Developer portal in API Management v2 tiers
1Limit for built-in widgets such as text, images, or APIs list. Currently, custom widgets and custom HTML code widgets aren't supported in the v2 tiers.
Azure App Service limits


1Apps and storage quotas are per App Service plan unless noted otherwise.
2The actual number of apps that you can host on these machines depends on the activity of the apps, the size of the machine instances, and the corresponding resource utilization.
3Dedicated instances can be of different sizes. For more information, seeApp Service pricing.
4More are allowed upon request.
5The storage limit is the total content size across all apps in the same App service plan. The total content size of all apps across all App service plans in a single resource group and region cannot exceed 500 GB. The file system quota for App Service hosted apps is determined by the aggregate of App Service plans created in a region and resource group.
6These resources are constrained by physical resources on the dedicated instances (the instance size and the number of instances).
7If you scale a Windows app in the Basic tier to two instances, you have 350 concurrent connections for each of the two instances. For Windows apps on Standard tier and above, there are no theoretical limits to WebSockets, but other factors can limit the number of WebSockets. For example, maximum concurrent requests allowed (defined bymaxConcurrentRequestsPerCpu) are: 7,500 per small VM, 15,000 per medium VM (7,500 x 2 cores), and 75,000 per large VM (18,750 x 4 cores). Linux apps are limited 5 concurrent WebSocket connections on Free SKU and ~50k concurrent WebSocket connections per instance on all other SKUs.
maxConcurrentRequestsPerCpu
8The maximum IP connections are per instance and depend on the instance size: 1,920 per B1/S1/P0V3/P1V3 instance, 3,968 per B2/S2/P2V3 instance, 8,064 per B3/S3/P3V3 instance.
9App Service Isolated SKUs can be internally load balanced (ILB) with Azure Load Balancer, so there's no public connectivity from the internet. As a result, some features of an ILB Isolated App Service must be used from machines that have direct access to the ILB network endpoint.
10Run custom executables and/or scripts on demand, on a schedule, or continuously as a background task within your App Service instance. Always On is required for continuous WebJobs execution. There's no predefined limit on the number of WebJobs that can run in an App Service instance. There are practical limits that depend on what the application code is trying to do.
11Only issuing standard certificates (wildcard certificates aren't available). Limited to only one free certificate per custom domain.
12Total storage usage across all apps deployed in a single App Service environment (regardless of how they're allocated across different resource groups).
Azure Automation limits
1A sandbox is a shared environment that can be used by multiple jobs. Jobs that use the same sandbox are bound by the resource limitations of the sandbox.2Free subscriptions includingAzure Free AccountandAzure for Studentsaren't eligible for limit or quota changes. If you have a free subscription, you canupgradeto pay-as-you-go subscription.3Limits for Government clouds: 200 concurrent running jobs at the same instance of time per Automation account, no limit on number of Automation accounts per subscription.
The following table shows the tracked item limits per machine for change tracking.
The following are the Dynamic scope recommended limits foreach dynamic scope:
The following are the limits for schedule patching:
Azure App Configuration
Azure Cache for Redis limits
Azure Cache for Redis limits and sizes are different for each pricing tier. To see the pricing tiers and their associated sizes, seeAzure Cache for Redis pricing.
For more information on Azure Cache for Redis configuration limits, seeDefault Redis server configuration.
Because configuration and management of Azure Cache for Redis instances is done by Microsoft, not all Redis commands are supported in Azure Cache for Redis. For more information, seeRedis commands not supported in Azure Cache for Redis.
Azure Cloud Services limits
1Each Azure Cloud Service with web or worker roles can have two deployments, one for production and one for staging. This limit refers to the number of distinct roles, that is, configuration. This limit doesn't refer to the number of instances per role, that is, scaling.
Azure AI Search limits
Pricing tiers determine the capacity and limits of your search service. These tiers include:
Free: Multitenant service that's shared with other Azure subscribers and helps with evaluations and small development projects
Basic: Provides dedicated computing resources for production workloads at a smaller scale and with up to three replicas for highly available query workloads
Standard: Includes S1, S2, S3, and S3 High Density; is for larger production workloads; multiple levels exist within the Standard tier for you to choose a resource configuration that best matches your workload profile
Limits per subscription
You can create multiplebillablesearch services (Basic and higher), up to the maximum number of services allowed at each tier, per region. For example, you could create up to 16 services at the Basic tier and another 16 services at the S1 tier within the same subscription and region. You could then create an additional 16 Basic services in another region for a combined total of 32 Basic services under the same subscription. For more information about tiers, seeChoose a tier (or SKU) for Azure AI Search.
Maximum service limits can be raised upon request. If you need more services within the same subscription,file a support request.
1You can have one free search service per Azure subscription. The free tier is based on infrastructure shared with other customers. Because the hardware isn't dedicated, scale-up isn't supported, and storage is limited to 50 MB. A free search service might be deleted after extended periods of inactivity to make room for more services.
2Search units (SU) are billing units, allocated as either areplicaor apartition. You need both. To learn more about SU combinations, seeEstimate and manage capacity of a search service.
Limits per search service
The following table covers SLA, partition counts, and replica counts at the service level.
1Basic tier supports three partitions and three replicas, for a total of nine search units (SU) onnew search servicescreated after April 3, 2024. Older basic services are limited to one partition and three replicas.
A search service is subject to a maximum storage limit (partition size multiplied by the number of partitions) or by a hard limit on themaximum number of indexesorindexers, whichever comes first.
Service-level agreements (SLAs) apply to billable services that have two or more replicas for query workloads, or three or more replicas for query and indexing workloads. The number of partitions isn't an SLA consideration. For more information, seeReliability in Azure AI Search.
Free services don't have fixed partitions or replicas and share resources with other subscribers.
Partition storage (GB)
Per-service storage limits vary by two things:service creation dateandregion. There are higher limits fornewer servicesin most supported regions.
This table shows the progression of storage quota increases in GB over time. Starting in April 2024, higher capacity partitions were brought online in the regions listed in the footnotes. If you have an older service in a supported region, check if you canupgrade your serviceto the higher storage limits.

Azure Communications Gateway limits
Some of the following default limits and quotas can be increased. To request a change, create anAzure portal support request, and describe the limit that you need to change.
The following restrictions apply to all Azure Communications Gateways:
All traffic must use IPv4.
All traffic must use TLS 1.2 or greater. Earlier versions aren't supported.
The number of active calls is limited to 15% of the number of users assigned to Azure Communications Gateway. For the definition of users, seePlan and manage costs for Azure Communications Gateway.
The number of calls being actively transcoded is limited to 5% of the total number of active calls.
Azure Communications Gateway also has limits on SIP signaling.
Some endpoints might add parameters in the following headers to an in-dialog message when those parameters weren't present in the dialog-creating message. In that case, Azure Communications Gateway strips the parameters, because RFC 3261 doesn't permit this behavior.
Request URI

From header
The Provisioning API has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute, applied across all the resources. A batch request to update multiple resources counts as one request.
Azure Container Apps limits
SeeQuotas in Azure Container Appsfor Azure Container Apps limits.
The amount of disk space available to your application varies based on the associated workload profile. Available disk space determines the image size limit you can deploy to your container apps.
For dedicated workload profiles, the image size limit is per instance.
* The image size limit for a consumption workload profile is a shared among both image and app. For example, logs used by your app are subject to this size limit.

Azure Functions limits
Notes on service limits:
By default, the time-out for the Functions 1.x runtime in an App Service plan is unbounded.
Requires the App Service plan be set toAlways On. Pay at standardrates. A grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates.
These limits areset in the host.
The actual number of function apps that you can host depends on the activity of the apps, the size of the machine instances, and the corresponding resource utilization.
The storage limit is the total content size in temporary storage across all apps in the same App Service plan. For Consumption plans on Linux, the storage is currently 1.5 GB.
Consumption plan uses an Azure Files share for persisted storage. When you provide your own Azure Files share, the specific share size limits depend on the storage account you set forWEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING.
On Linux, you mustexplicitly mount your own Azure Files share.
When your function app is hosted in aConsumption plan, only the CNAME option is supported. For function apps in aPremium planor anApp Service plan, you can map a custom domain using either a CNAME or an A record.
There's no maximum execution time-out duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutesduring scale inand 10 minutes during platform updates.
Workers are roles that host customer apps. Workers are available in three fixed sizes: One vCPU/3.5 GB RAM; Two vCPU/7 GB RAM; Four vCPU/14 GB RAM.
SeeApp Service limitsfor details.
Including the production slot.
There's currently a limit of 5,000 function apps in a given subscription.
Flex Consumption plan instance sizes are currently defined as either 2,048 MB or 4,096 MB. For more information, seeInstance memory.
Flex Consumption plan has a regional subscription quota that limits the total memory usage of all instances across a given region. For more information, seeRegional subscription memory quotas. Container Apps has Environments and cores quotas per subscription. SeeQuotas for Azure Container Apps.
When theminimum number of replicasis set to zero, the default time-out depends on the specific triggers used in the app.
When theminimum number of replicasis set to one or more.
On Container Apps, you can set themaximum number of replicas, which is honored as long as there's enough cores quota available.

Azure Key Vault limits
Azure Key Vault service supports two resource types: Vaults and Managed HSMs. The following two sections describe the service limits for each of them respectively.
Resource type: vault
This section describes service limits for resource typevaults.
vaults
Note
In the previous table, we see that for RSA 2,048-bit software keys, 4,000 GET transactions per 10 seconds are allowed. For RSA 2,048-bit HSM-keys, 2,000 GET transactions per 10 seconds are allowed.
The throttling thresholds are weighted, and enforcement is on their sum. For example, as shown in the previous table, when you perform GET operations on RSA HSM-keys, it's eight times more expensive to use 4,096-bit keys compared to 2,048-bit keys. That's because 2,000/250 = 8.
In a given 10-second interval, an Azure Key Vault client can doonly oneof the following operations before it encounters a429throttling HTTP status code:
429
4,000 RSA 2,048-bit software-key GET transactions
2,000 RSA 2,048-bit HSM-key GET transactions
250 RSA 4,096-bit HSM-key GET transactions
248 RSA 4,096-bit HSM-key GET transactions and 16 RSA 2,048-bit HSM-key GET transactions
For information on how to handle throttling when these limits are exceeded, seeAzure Key Vault throttling guidance.
1A subscription-wide limit for all transaction types is five times per key vault limit.
When you back up a key vault object, such as a secret, key, or certificate, the backup operation will download the object as an encrypted blob. This blob cannot be decrypted outside of Azure. To get usable data from this blob, you must restore the blob into a key vault within the same Azure subscription and Azure geography
Note
Attempting to backup a key, secret, or certificate object with more versions than above limit will result in an error. It is not possible to delete previous versions of a key, secret, or certificate.
Limits on count of keys, secrets and certificates:
Key Vault does not restrict the number of keys, secrets or certificates that can be stored in a vault. The transaction limits on the vault should be taken into account to ensure that operations are not throttled.
Key Vault does not restrict the number of versions on a secret, key or certificate, but storing a large number of versions (500+) can impact the performance of backup operations. SeeAzure Key Vault Backup.
Resource type: Managed HSM
This section describes service limits for resource typemanaged HSM.
managed HSM
Each Managed HSM instance constitutes three load balanced HSM partitions. The throughput limits are a function of underlying hardware capacity allocated for each partition. The tables below show maximum throughput with at least one partition available. Actual throughput may be up to 3x higher if all three partitions are available.
Throughput limits noted assume that one single key is being used to achieve maximum throughput. For example, if a single RSA-2048 key is used the maximum throughput will be 1100 sign operations. If you use 1100 different keys with one transaction per second each, they will not be able to achieve the same throughput.
This table describes number of operations per second for each curve type.
Encrypt and Decrypt operations assume a 4KB packet size.
Throughput limits for Encrypt/Decrypt apply to AES-CBC and AES-GCM algorithms.
Throughput limits for Wrap/Unwrap apply to AES-KW algorithm.
Azure Managed Identity limits
Each managed identity counts towards the object quota limit in a Microsoft Entra tenant as described inMicrosoft Entra service limits and restrictions.

In addition to the following limits, there arecomposite limit on the number of routes, domains, protocols, and paths.
1If the traffic isn't globally distributed and concentrated in one or more regions, or if a higher quota limited is need, create anAzure support request.
2Azure Front Door currently has a 5,000 request per seconds per POP limit.
3If you need more than 3,000 concurrent WebSocket connections, submit aAzure support request.
Header timeout - After establishing TCP/TLS connection, Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving all headers from the client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds. You can't configure this timeout value.
HTTP keep-alive timeout - Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds. You can't configure this timeout value.
After the HTTP request gets forwarded to the back end, Azure Front Door waits for 60 seconds (Standard and Premium) or 30 seconds (classic) for the first packet from the back end. Then it returns a 503 error to the client, or 504 for a cached request. You can configure this value using theoriginResponseTimeoutSecondsfield in Azure Front Door Standard and Premium API, or the sendRecvTimeoutSeconds field in the Azure Front Door (classic) API.

Azure Route Server limits
1If your NVA advertises more routes than the limit, the BGP session gets dropped.
Note
The total number of routes advertised from virtual network address space and Route Server towards ExpressRoute circuit, whenBranch-to-branchenabled, must not exceed 1,000. For more information, seeRoute advertisement limitsof ExpressRoute.
Azure ExpressRoute limits
*100-Gbps ExpressRoute Direct Only
Note
Global Reach connections count against the limit of virtual network connections per ExpressRoute Circuit. For example, a 10 Gbps Premium Circuit would allow for 5 Global Reach connections and 95 connections to the ExpressRoute Gateways or 95 Global Reach connections and 5 connections to the ExpressRoute Gateways or any other combination up to the limit of 100 connections for the circuit.
The following tables provide an overview of the different types of gateways, their respective limitations, and their expected performance metrics.
This table applies to both the Azure Resource Manager and classic deployment models.
1The values in the table are estimates and vary depending on the CPU utilization of the gateway. If the CPU utilization is high and the number of supported VMs is exceeded, the gateway will start to drop packets.
Note
ExpressRoute can facilitate up to 11,000 routes that span virtual network address spaces, on-premises networks, and any relevant virtual network peering connections. To ensure stability of your ExpressRoute connection, refrain from advertising more than 11,000 routes to ExpressRoute. The maximum number of routes advertised by gateway is 1,000 routes.
Important
Application performance depends on multiple factors, such as end-to-end latency and the number of traffic flows that the application opens. The numbers in the table represent the upper limit that the application can theoretically achieve in an ideal environment. Additionally, we perform routine host and OS maintenance on the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway, to maintain reliability of the service. During a maintenance period, the control plane and data path capacity of the gateway is reduced.
During a maintenance period, you might experience intermittent connectivity problems to private endpoint resources.
ExpressRoute supports a maximum TCP and UDP packet size of 1,400 bytes. Packet sizes larger than 1,400 bytes will get fragmented.
Azure Route Server can support up to 4,000 VMs. This limit includes VMs in virtual networks that are peered. For more information, seeAzure Route Server limitations.
The values in the table above represent the limits at each Gateway SKU.
Azure NAT Gateway limits
The following limits apply to NAT gateway resources managed through Azure Resource Manager per region per subscription. Learn how toview your current resource usage against your subscription limits.

Azure Resource Manager limits for web service calls
Azure Resource Manager has limits for API calls. You can make API calls at a rate within theAzure Resource Manager API limits.
Azure virtual machine disk limits
You can attach a number of data disks to an Azure virtual machine (VM). Based on the scalability and performance targets for a VM's data disks, you can determine the number and type of disk that you need to meet your performance and capacity requirements.
Important
For optimal performance, limit the number of highly utilized disks attached to the virtual machine to avoid possible throttling. If all attached disks aren't highly utilized at the same time, the virtual machine can support a larger number of disks. Additionally, when creating a managed disk from an existing managed disk, only 49 disks can be created concurrently. More disks can be created after some of the initial 49 have been created.
For Azure managed disks:
The following table illustrates the default and maximum limits of the number of resources per region per subscription. The limits remain the same irrespective of disks encrypted with either platform-managed keys or customer-managed keys. There is no limit for the number of Managed Disks, snapshots and images per resource group.
1An individual disk can have 500 incremental snapshots.
2This is the default max but higher capacities are supported by request. To request an increase in capacity, request a quota increase or contact Azure Support.
For standard storage accounts:
A Standard storage account has a maximum total request rate of 20,000 IOPS. The total IOPS across all of your virtual machine disks in a Standard storage account should not exceed this limit.
For unmanaged disks, you can roughly calculate the number of highly utilized disks supported by a single standard storage account based on the request rate limit. For example, for a Basic tier VM, the maximum number of highly utilized disks is about 66, which is 20,000/300 IOPS per disk. The maximum number of highly utilized disks for a Standard tier VM is about 40, which is 20,000/500 IOPS per disk.
For premium storage accounts:
A premium storage account has a maximum total throughput rate of 50 Gbps. The total throughput across all of your VM disks should not exceed this limit.
Seesizes for virtual machines in Azurefor more information.
For VM Applications
When working with VM applications in Azure, you may encounter an error message that says "Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved UnmanagedStorageAccountCount quota." This error occurs when you have reached the limit for the number of unmanaged storage accounts that you can use.
When you publish a VM application, Azure needs to replicate it across multiple regions. To do this, Azure creates an unmanaged storage account for each region. The number of unmanaged storage accounts that an application uses is determined by the number of replicas across all applications.
As a general rule, each storage account can accommodate up to 200 simultaneous connections. Below are options for resolving the "UnmanagedStorageAccountCount" error:
Use page blobs for your source application blobs. Unmanaged accounts are only used for block blob replication. Page blobs have no such limits.
Reduce the number of replicas for your VM Application versions or delete applications you no longer need.
File a support request to obtain a quota increase.
SeeVM Applications overviewfor more information.

Azure StorSimple System limits
If there are more than 16 volumes, they're processed sequentially as processing slots become available.
New backups of a cloned or a restored tiered volume can't occur until the operation is finished. For a local volume, backups are allowed after the volume is online.
The volume is made available within 2 minutes of a restore or clone operation, regardless of the volume size.
The volume performance might initially be slower than normal as most of the data and metadata still resides in the cloud. Performance might increase as data flows from the cloud to the StorSimple device.
The total time to download metadata depends on the allocated volume size. Metadata is automatically brought into the device in the background at the rate of 5 minutes per TB of allocated volume data. This rate might be affected by Internet bandwidth to the cloud.
The restore or clone operation is complete when all the metadata is on the device.
Backup operations can't be performed until the restore or clone operation is fully complete.
The volume is made available within 2 minutes of the restore operation, regardless of the volume size.
The volume performance might initially be slower than normal as most of the data and metadata still resides in the cloud. Performance might increase as data flows from the cloud to the StorSimple device.
The total time to download metadata depends on the allocated volume size. Metadata is automatically brought into the device in the background at the rate of 5 minutes per TB of allocated volume data. This rate might be affected by Internet bandwidth to the cloud.
Unlike tiered volumes, if there are locally pinned volumes, the volume data is also downloaded locally on the device. The restore operation is complete when all the volume data has been brought to the device.
The restore operations might be long and the total time to complete the restore will depend on the size of the provisioned local volume, your Internet bandwidth, and the existing data on the device. Backup operations on the locally pinned volume are allowed while the restore operation is in progress.
*Maximum throughput per I/O type was measured with 100 percent read and 100 percent write scenarios. Actual throughput might be lower and depends on I/O mix and network conditions.

Azure Virtual Machines limits
Azure Virtual Machines limits
1Virtual machines created by using the classic deployment model instead of Azure Resource Manager are automatically stored in a cloud service. You can add more virtual machines to that cloud service for load balancing and availability.
2Input endpoints allow communications to a virtual machine from outside the virtual machine's cloud service. Virtual machines in the same cloud service or virtual network can automatically communicate with each other.
Azure Virtual Machines limits - Azure Resource Manager
The following limits apply when you use Azure Resource Manager and Azure resource groups.
1Default limits vary by offer category type, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350. For security, subscriptions default to 20 cores to prevent large core deployments. If you need more cores, submit a support ticket.
2Properties such as SSH public keys are also pushed as certificates and count towards this limit. To bypass this limit, use theAzure Key Vault extension for Windowsor theAzure Key Vault extension for Linuxto install certificates.
3With Azure Resource Manager, certificates are stored in the Azure Key Vault. The number of certificates is unlimited for a subscription. There's a 1-MB limit of certificates per deployment, which consists of either a single VM or an availability set.
Note
Virtual machine cores have a regional total limit. They also have a limit for regional per-size series, such as Dv2 and F. These limits are separately enforced. For example, consider a subscription with a US East total VM core limit of 30, an A series core limit of 30, and a D series core limit of 30. This subscription can deploy 30 A1 VMs, or 30 D1 VMs, or a combination of the two not to exceed a total of 30 cores. An example of a combination is 10 A1 VMs and 20 D1 VMs.
Azure Compute Gallery limits
There are limits per subscription for deploying resources when you use Compute Galleries:
100 compute galleries per subscription and per region
1,000 image definitions per subscription and per region
10,000 image versions per subscription and per region
Managed Run Command limit
The maximum allowed Managed Run Commands is currently limited to 25.
