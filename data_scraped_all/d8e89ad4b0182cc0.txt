Improve performance by compressing files in Azure Front Door

File compression is an effective method to improve file transfer speed and increase page-load performance. The server compresses the file to reduce its size before sending it. File compression can reduce bandwidth costs and provide a better experience for your users.
There are two ways to enable file compression:
Enabling compression on your origin server. Azure Front Door passes along the compressed files and delivers them to clients that request them.
Enabling compression directly on the Azure Front Door POP servers (compression on the fly). In this case, Azure Front Door compresses the files and sends them to the end users.
Note
Range requests may be compressed into different sizes. Azure Front Door requires theContent-Lengthresponse header values to be the same for any GET HTTP request. If clients send byte range requests with theAccept-Encodingheader that leads to the origin responding with different content lengths, then Azure Front Door returns a 503 error. You can either disable compression on the origin/Azure Front Door, or create a Rules Engine rule to remove theAccept-Encodingheader from byte range requests.

Important
Azure Front Door configuration changes take up to 10 mins to propagate throughout the network. If you're setting up compression for the first time for your CDN endpoint, consider waiting 1-2 hours before you troubleshoot to ensure the compression settings have propagated to all the POPs.
Enabling compression
Note
In Azure Front Door, compression is part ofEnable Cachingin Route. Only when youEnable Caching, can you take advantage of compression in Azure Front Door.
You can enable compression in the following ways:
During quick create - When you enable caching, you can enable compression.
During custom, create - Enable caching and compression when you're adding a route.
In Front Door manager.
On the Optimization page.
Enable compression in Front Door manager
From the Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile page, go toFront Door managerand select the endpoint you want to enable compression.

Compression rules
In Azure Front Door, only eligible files are compressed. To be eligible for compression, a file must:
Be of a MIME type
Be larger than 1 KB
Be smaller than 8 MB
These profiles support the following compression encodings:
gzip (GNU zip)
brotli
If the request supports more than one compression type, brotli compression takes precedence.
When a request for an asset specifies gzip compression and the request results in a cache miss, Azure Front Door does gzip compression of the asset directly on the POP server. Afterward, the compressed file is served  from the cache.
If the origin uses Chunked Transfer Encoding (CTE) to send data to the Azure Front Door POP, then compression isn't supported.
