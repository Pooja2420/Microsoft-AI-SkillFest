SMA OpCon in Azure
Solution ideas
This article describes a solution idea. Your cloud architect can use this guidance to help visualize the major components for a typical implementation of this architecture. Use this article as a starting point to design a well-architected solution that aligns with your workload's specific requirements.
This article presents a solution for automating workloads that run on various types of servers and systems throughout an enterprise. The solution uses OpCon from SMA Technologies in a Kubernetes configuration in Azure. From a single automation control point, OpCon facilitates workflows across the enterpriseâboth on-premises and in Azure.

Workflow
An OpCon container provides core services, which are deployed within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These core services include Solution Manager, a web-based user interface. Users can interact with the entire OpCon environment by using Solution Manager. Besides other components, the environment includes:Persistent volumes that store logs and configuration information and provide data persistence across container restarts. For these volumes, the solution uses Azure Files, which is configured in theStorageClassvalue.The OpCon database.Virtual machines (VMs) that run workloads.

Azure VMs make up the application infrastructure. The placement of these VMs in subnets and virtual networks is flexible. For more information, seeComponent placement.To manage workloads on these VMs and on-premises legacy systems, OpCon core services communicate with OpCon agents that are installed on the VMs. The core services communicate with on-premises systems through a site-to-site connection on a virtual network gateway.OpCon core services communicate directly with applications that provide REST API endpoints. These applications don't need extra software to connect to the core services. With on-premises systems, the communication uses REST API connectivity options and travels via a virtual network gateway.

The gateway includes a cross-premises IPsec/IKE VPN tunnel connection between Azure VPN Gateway and an on-premises VPN device. All data that passes between the Azure cloud and the on-premises environment is encrypted in this site-to-site private tunnel as it crosses the internet.

Azure Virtual Networkis the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. Through Virtual Network, Azure resources like VMs can securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. An Azure virtual network is like a traditional network that operates in a datacenter. But an Azure virtual network also provides scalability, availability, isolation, and other benefits of the Azure infrastructure.

Azure Site Recoveryhelps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery can replicate workloads that run on physical machines and VMs from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to a secondary location and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.

OpCon Visionprovides a dashboard for monitoring OpCon tasks. The dashboard displays a logical representation of the tasks across all flows. Vision uses tags to group associated tasks together. When problems occur, you can drill down from the dashboard to failed tasks. Vision also provides a way to set SLA values for each group. The dashboard gives early warning when defined SLA values might not be met.

Alternatives
The following sections describe alternatives to consider when you implement the solution.
The placement of the VMs and OpCon database is flexible.
The application subnet can include the application VMs. You can also install the application servers in multiple subnets or virtual networks. Use this approach when you want to create separate environments for different types of servers, such as web and application servers.

You can place the database inside or outside the OpCon subnet.
You can place the database inside or outside the OpCon subnet.
Instead of using SQL Database, you can use SQL Managed Instance as the OpCon database. You can install the SQL managed instance in the OpCon subnet. Alternatively, you can install the managed instance in a separate subnet that you use exclusively for SQL managed instances in the existing virtual network.
Instead of using VPN Gateway and a site-to-site VPN tunnel, you can use ExpressRoute, which uses a connectivity provider to establish a private connection to the Microsoft global network. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet.
We recommend ExpressRoute for hybrid applications that run large-scale business-critical workloads that require a high degree of scalability and resiliency.
Scenario details
The core OpCon module that facilitates workloads is the Schedule Activity Monitor (SAM). This module communicates with agents on target systems to schedule and monitor tasks. SAM also receives external events. You can install OpCon agents on the following platforms:
Windows
Linux or Unix
Unisys ClearPath Forward mainframes (MCP and 2200)
IBM z/OS
IBM AIX
SAM draws the various platforms together under one automation umbrella.
You can install OpCon in an Azure cloud environment. OpCon supports cloud-only infrastructures and also hybrid infrastructures that contain cloud and on-premises systems.
The OpCon software is available from Docker Hub as Docker images that you can deploy in a cloud environment. For the Azure cloud, this solution uses AKS to deploy the OpCon environment within a Kubernetes cluster. SQL Database is used as the database.
For hybrid environments, VPN Gateway provides a secure link between cloud infrastructure and on-premises infrastructure.
The implementation uses a single virtual network and multiple subnets to support various functions. You can use network security groups to filter network traffic between Azure resources in the virtual network.
AKS configuration
The deployed OpCon environment consists of two pods within a single replica set and an instance of SQL Database. A load balancer controls access to the pods. The load balancer maps external addresses and ports to internal REST API server addresses and ports.
The following diagram shows configuration requirements for an environment with two pods: OpCon and Impex2. The diagram also shows the relationship between various definitions in the Kubernetes configuration YAML file.
