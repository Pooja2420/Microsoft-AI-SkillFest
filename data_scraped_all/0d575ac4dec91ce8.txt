This article provides step by step details for creating and configuring an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) using the Azure portal. Also included in the article are alternate methods for working with AMPLS using CLI, PowerShell, and ARM templates.
Configuring an instance of Azure Private Link requires the following steps. Each of these steps is detailed in the sections below.
Create an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS).
Connect resources to the AMPLS.
Connect AMPLS to a private endpoint.
Configure access to AMPLS resources.
This article reviews how configuration is done through the Azure portal. It provides an example Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to automate the process.
Create Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)
From theMonitormenu in the Azure portal, selectPrivate Link Scopesand thenCreate.

Select the component and selectApplyto add it to your scope. Only Azure Monitor resources including Log Analytics workspaces, Application Insights components, and data collection endpoints (DCEs) are available.

Note
Deleting Azure Monitor resources requires that you first disconnect them from any AMPLS objects they're connected to. It's not possible to delete resources connected to an AMPLS.
Connect AMPLS to a private endpoint
Once resources are connected to your AMPLS, you can create a private endpoint to connect your network.
From the menu for your AMPLS, selectPrivate Endpoint connectionsand thenPrivate Endpoint. You can also approve connections that were started in thePrivate Link Centerhere by selecting them and selectingApprove.

Configure access to AMPLS resources
From the menu for your AMPLS, selectNetwork Isolationto control which networks can reach the resource through a private link and whether other networks can reach it or not.

Connected AMPLS
This screen allows you to review and configure the resource's connections to the AMPLS. Connecting to an AMPLS allows traffic from the connected virtual network connected to reach the resource. It has the same effect as connecting it from the scope described inConnect Azure Monitor resources.
To add a new connection, selectAddand select the AMPLS. Your resource can connect to five AMPLS objects, as described inAMPLS limits.
Virtual networks access configuration
These settings control access from public networks not connected to the listed scopes. This includes access to logs, metrics, and the live metrics stream. It also includes experiences built on top of this data such as workbooks, dashboards, query API-based client experiences, and insights in the Azure portal. Experiences running outside the Azure portal and that query Log Analytics data also have to be running within the private-linked virtual network.
If you setAccept data ingestion from public networks not connected through a Private Link ScopetoNo, clients like machines or SDKs outside of the connected scopes can't upload data or send logs to the resource.
If you setAccept queries from public networks not connected through a Private Link ScopetoNo, clients like machines or SDKs outside of the connected scopes can't query data in the resource.
Work with AMPLS using CLI
Create an AMPLS with Open access modes
The following CLI command creates a new AMPLS resource named"my-scope", with both query and ingestion access modes set toOpen.
"my-scope"
Open
az resource create -g "my-resource-group" --name "my-scope" -l global --api-version "2021-07-01-preview" --resource-type Microsoft.Insights/privateLinkScopes --properties "{\"accessModeSettings\":{\"queryAccessMode\":\"Open\", \"ingestionAccessMode\":\"Open\"}}"
az resource create -g "my-resource-group" --name "my-scope" -l global --api-version "2021-07-01-preview" --resource-type Microsoft.Insights/privateLinkScopes --properties "{\"accessModeSettings\":{\"queryAccessMode\":\"Open\", \"ingestionAccessMode\":\"Open\"}}"
Set resource access flags
To manage the workspace or component access flags, use the flags[--ingestion-access {Disabled, Enabled}]and[--query-access {Disabled, Enabled}]onaz monitor log-analytics workspaceoraz monitor app-insights component.
[--ingestion-access {Disabled, Enabled}]
[--query-access {Disabled, Enabled}]
Work with AMPLS using PowerShell
Create an AMPLS
The following PowerShell script creates a new AMPLS resource named"my-scope", with the query access mode set toOpenbut the ingestion access modes set toPrivateOnly. This setting means it will allow ingestion only to resources in the AMPLS.
"my-scope"
Open
PrivateOnly

Use the following PowerShell code to set the access mode flags on your AMPLS after it's created.
# get private link scope resource
$scope = Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.Insights/privateLinkScopes -ResourceGroupName $scopeResourceGroup -ResourceName $scopeName -ApiVersion "2021-07-01-preview"

# set access mode settings
$scope.Properties.AccessModeSettings.QueryAccessMode = "Open";
$scope.Properties.AccessModeSettings.IngestionAccessMode = "Open";
$scope | Set-AzResource -Force
# get private link scope resource
$scope = Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.Insights/privateLinkScopes -ResourceGroupName $scopeResourceGroup -ResourceName $scopeName -ApiVersion "2021-07-01-preview"

# set access mode settings
$scope.Properties.AccessModeSettings.QueryAccessMode = "Open";
$scope.Properties.AccessModeSettings.IngestionAccessMode = "Open";
$scope | Set-AzResource -Force

Review and validate AMPLS configuration
Follow the steps in this section to review and validate your private link setup.
Review endpoint's DNS settings
The private endpoint created in this article should have the following five DNS zones configured:
privatelink.monitor.azure.com
privatelink.monitor.azure.com
privatelink.oms.opinsights.azure.com
privatelink.oms.opinsights.azure.com
privatelink.ods.opinsights.azure.com
privatelink.ods.opinsights.azure.com
privatelink.agentsvc.azure-automation.net
privatelink.agentsvc.azure-automation.net
privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
Each of these zones maps specific Azure Monitor endpoints to private IPs from the virtual network's pool of IPs. The IP addresses shown in the images below are only examples. Your configuration should instead show private IPs from your own network.
privatelink-monitor-azure-com
privatelink-monitor-azure-com
This zone covers the global endpoints used by Azure Monitor, which means endpoints serve requests globally/regionally and not resource-specific requests. This zone should have endpoints mapped for the following:
in.ai: Application Insights ingestion endpoint (both a global and a regional entry).
api: Application Insights and Log Analytics API endpoint.
live: Application Insights live metrics endpoint.
profiler: Application Insights Profiler for .NET endpoint.
snapshot: Application Insights snapshot endpoint.
diagservices-query: Application Insights Profiler for .NET and Snapshot Debugger (used when accessing profiler/debugger results in the Azure portal).
This zone also covers the resource-specific endpoints for the following DCEs:
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>.handler.control: Private configuration endpoint, part of a DCE resource.
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>.handler.control: Private configuration endpoint, part of a DCE resource.
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>.handler.control
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>.ingest: Private ingestion endpoint, part of a DCE resource.
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>.ingest: Private ingestion endpoint, part of a DCE resource.
<unique-dce-identifier>.<regionname>.ingest

Log Analytics endpoints
Log Analytics uses the following four DNS zones:
privatelink-oms-opinsights-azure-com: Covers workspace-specific mapping to OMS endpoints. You should see an entry for each workspace linked to the AMPLS connected with this private endpoint.
privatelink-oms-opinsights-azure-com
privatelink-ods-opinsights-azure-com: Covers workspace-specific mapping to ODS endpoints, which are the ingestion endpoints of Log Analytics. You should see an entry for each workspace linked to the AMPLS connected with this private endpoint.
privatelink-ods-opinsights-azure-com
privatelink-agentsvc-azure-automation-net*: Covers workspace-specific mapping to the agent service automation endpoints. You should see an entry for each workspace linked to the AMPLS connected with this private endpoint.
privatelink-agentsvc-azure-automation-net*
privatelink-blob-core-windows-net: Configures connectivity to the global agents' solution packs storage account. Through it, agents can download new or updated solution packs, which are also known as management packs. Only one entry is required to handle all Log Analytics agents, no matter how many workspaces are used. This entry is only added to private link setups created at or after April 19, 2021 (or starting June 2021 on Azure sovereign clouds).
privatelink-blob-core-windows-net
The following screenshot shows endpoints mapped for an AMPLS with two workspaces in East US and one workspace in West Europe. Notice the East US workspaces share the IP addresses. The West Europe workspace endpoint is mapped to a different IP address. The blob endpoint is configured although it doesn't appear in this image.

Validate communication over AMPLS
To validate that your requests are now sent through the private endpoint, review them with your browser or a network tracking tool. For example, when you attempt to query your workspace or application, make sure the request is sent to the private IP mapped to the API endpoint. In this example, it's172.17.0.9.NoteSome browsers might use other DNS settings. For more information, seeBrowser DNS settings. Make sure your DNS settings apply.

Note
Some browsers might use other DNS settings. For more information, seeBrowser DNS settings. Make sure your DNS settings apply.
To make sure your workspaces or components aren't receiving requests from public networks (not connected through AMPLS), set the resource's public ingestion and query flags toNoas explained inConfigure access to your resources.

nslookup
Testing locally
To test private links locally without affecting other clients on your network, make sure not to update your DNS when you create your private endpoint. Instead, edit the hosts file on your machine so that it will send requests to the private link endpoints:
Set up a private link, but when you connect to a private endpoint, choose not to auto-integrate with the DNS.
Configure the relevant endpoints on your machines' hosts files.
Additional configuration
Network subnet size
The smallest supported IPv4 subnet is /27 using CIDR subnet definitions. Although Azure virtual networkscan be as small as /29, Azurereserves five IP addresses. The Azure Monitor private link setup requires at least 11 more IP addresses even if you're connecting to a single workspace.Review your endpoint's DNS settingsfor the list of Azure Monitor private link endpoints.
Azure portal
To use Azure Monitor portal experiences for Application Insights, Log Analytics, and DCEs, allow the Azure portal and Azure Monitor extensions to be accessible on the private networks. AddAzureActiveDirectory,AzureResourceManager,AzureFrontDoor.FirstParty, andAzureFrontdoor.Frontendservice tagsto your network security group.
Programmatic access
To use the REST API, the AzureCLI, or PowerShell with Azure Monitor on private networks, add theservice tagsAzureActiveDirectoryandAzureResourceManagerto your firewall.
Browser DNS settings
If you're connecting to your Azure Monitor resources over a private link, traffic to these resources must go through the private endpoint that's configured on your network. To enable the private endpoint, update your DNS settings as described inConnect to a private endpoint. Some browsers use their own DNS settings instead of the ones you set. The browser might attempt to connect to Azure Monitor public endpoints and bypass the private link entirely. Verify that your browser settings don't override or cache old DNS settings.
Querying limitation: externaldata operator
Theexternaldataoperator isn't supported over a private link because it reads data from storage accounts but doesn't guarantee the storage is accessed privately.
TheAzure Data Explorer proxy (ADX proxy)allows log queries to query Azure Data Explorer. The ADX proxy isn't supported over a private link because it doesn't guarantee the targeted resource is accessed privately.
Next steps

To create and manage Private Link Scopes, use theREST APIor theAzure CLI (az monitor private-link-scope).
