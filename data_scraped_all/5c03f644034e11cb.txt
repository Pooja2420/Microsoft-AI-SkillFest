Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following items:
An Azure subscription. SeeGet Azure free trial.
Create a Data Lake Storage Gen1 account
Sign on to the newAzure portal.
Sign on to the newAzure portal.
ClickCreate a resource > Storage > Data Lake Storage Gen1.

In theNew Data Lake Storage Gen1blade, provide the values as shown in the following screenshot:Name. Enter a unique name for the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account.Subscription. Select the subscription under which you want to create a new Data Lake Storage Gen1 account.Resource Group. Select an existing resource group, or select theCreate newoption to create one. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an application. For more information, seeResource Groups in Azure.Location: Select a location where you want to create the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account.Encryption Settings. There are three options:Do not enable encryption.Use keys managed by Data Lake Storage Gen1,  if you want Data Lake Storage Gen1 to manage your encryption keys.Use keys from your own Key Vault. You can select an existing Azure Key Vault or create a new Key Vault. To use the keys from a Key Vault, you must assign permissions for the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account to access the Azure Key Vault.

Assign permissions to Azure Key Vault
If you used keys from an Azure Key Vault to configure encryption on the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account, you must configure access between the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account and the Azure Key Vault account. Perform the following steps to do so.
If you used keys from the Azure Key Vault, the blade for the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account displays a warning at the top. Click the warning to openEncryption.
If you used keys from the Azure Key Vault, the blade for the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account displays a warning at the top. Click the warning to openEncryption.

The blade shows two options to configure access.In the first option, clickGrant Permissionsto configure access. The first option is enabled only when the user that created the Data Lake Storage Gen1 account is also an admin for the Azure Key Vault.The other option is to run the PowerShell cmdlet displayed on the blade. You need to be the owner of the Azure Key Vault or have the ability to grant permissions on the Azure Key Vault. After you have run the cmdlet, come back to the blade and clickEnableto configure access.
