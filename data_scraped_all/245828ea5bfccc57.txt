Save money with Azure Data Explorer by prepaying for the markup units compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you make a commitment for Azure Data Explorer use for a period of one or three years to get a significant discount on the Azure Data Explorer markup costs. To purchase Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you only need to specify the term, it will apply to all deployments of Azure Data Explorer in all regions.
By purchasing a reservation, you're pre-paying for the markup costs for a period of one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the Azure Data Explorer markup charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. Azure Data Explorer clusters that are already running or ones that are newly deployed will automatically get the benefit. This reservation doesn't cover compute, networking, or storage charges associated with the clusters. Reserved capacity for these resources needs to be purchased separately. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires and the Azure Data Explorer markup units are billed at the pay-as-you go price. Reservations don't auto-renew. For pricing information, see theAzure Data Explorer pricing page.
