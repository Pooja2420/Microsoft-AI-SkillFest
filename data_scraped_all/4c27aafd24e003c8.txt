Based on feedback weâve received from customers weâre happy to announce that we're extending the retirement date by one year to 6 September 2023, for the Azure NC-Series virtual machine to give you more time to plan your migration.
As we continue to bring modern and optimized virtual machine instances to Azure using the latest innovations in datacenter technologies, we thoughtfully plan how we retire aging hardware.
With this planning in mind, we're retiring our NC (v1) GPU VM sizes, powered by NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs on 6 September 2023.
How does the NC-series migration affect me?
After 6 September 2023, any remaining NC size virtual machines remaining in your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These virtual machines will be stopped and removed from the host. These virtual machines will no longer be billed in the deallocated state.
This VM size retirement only impacts the VM sizes in theNC-series. This doesn't impact the newerNCv3,NCasT4 v3, andNC A100 v4series virtual machines.
What actions should I take?
You need to resize or deallocate your NC virtual machines. We recommend moving your GPU workloads to another GPU Virtual Machine size. Learn more about migrating your workloads to anotherGPU Accelerated Virtual Machine size.
