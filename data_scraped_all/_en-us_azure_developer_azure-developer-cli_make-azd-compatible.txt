The Azure Developer CLI (azd) utilizestemplatesto provision and deploy app resources to the cloud. Developers can add support forazdcommands and features by converting their applications to templates. This article provides a contextual overview of the different options for buildingazdtemplates. Once you understand the concepts in this article, visit the following resources for more detailed implementation guides:

Template creation concepts
Creating anazdtemplate requires adding specific configuration and infrastructure assets to your existing code base, or starting a new app from an existing template those same assets. Both workflows are explained in later sections. Allazdtemplates share a similar file structure based aroundazdconventions. The following diagram gives a quick overview of the process to create anazdtemplate:

Everyazdtemplate requires the following minimum resources:
azd
Aninfrafolder that holds the infrastructure as code (Bicep or Terraform) files.
infra
Anazure.yamlconfiguration file that maps your application services to the provisioned infrastructure resources.
azure.yaml
Other optional directories are often included as well, such as a.githubfolder with assets to create a CI/CD pipeline. Visit thetemplate overviewdoc for more information about templates.
.github
Consider the following sample app repository:

After converting this sample app to anazdtemplate, the same app repository contains the following:
azd

The original app resources are unchanged, but new assets were added thatazddepends on for commands such asazd up:
azd
azd up
Aninfrafolder was added that includes Bicep files to create Azure resources.

Anazure.yamlconfiguration file was added to map the app code in thesrcdirectory to the provision Azure resources.

A.azurefolder was created to holdazdenvironment variables.

A.githubfolder (optional) was added to support CI/CD pipelines through GitHub actions.

Template creation workflows
Theazd initcommand is used to initialize anazdtemplate for provisioning and deploying the app resources on Azure. The command prompts you to choose between two different workflows to initialize a template that are outlined in the following sections -Use code in the current directoryandUse an existing template.
azd init
azd
Run theazd initcommand in the root of the directory you'd like to convert to anazd template:
azd init
azd template
azd init
azd init

Use code in the current directory
This option instructsazdto analyze the code in your directory to identity which technologies it uses, such as the programming language, framework and database system.azdautomatically generates template assets for you, such as theazure.yamlservice definition file and theinfrafolder with infrastructure-as-code files. The generated assets are a starting point for additional modifications. Use this approach if you plan to use common Azure services supported byazdscaffolding features.

Visit theStart with your app code to create a templatetutorial for details on how to implement this approach and more information on which Azure resources support automatic detection and scaffolding.
Select a template
Select this option to use an existing template that defines many of your Azure resources and architectural goals as a starting point.azdwill prompt you to select a starter template or another template from theawesome-azdgallery. When you select a template, the assets of that template are added to your existing project directory to use as a starting point. Some templates include sample app code that you can replace with your own, while some (called "starter templates") are infrastructure only.
azd
Use theazd initcommand to pull down an existing template to an empty directory and use it as a starting point for your own app. If the template includes app source code, you can either build off of that code or replace the source code directory with your own.
azd init
Visit theStart with an existing templatetutorial for details on how to implement this approach.
