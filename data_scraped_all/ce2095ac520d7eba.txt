Azure managed disks are a type of Azure Disk Storage that simplify the management of storage for Azure Virtual Machines. Managed disks are block-level storage volumes that Azure manages. They're similar to physical disks in an on-premises server, but they operate in a virtual environment. When you use a managed disk, you must specify the disk size type and configure the disk. After you configure the disk, Azure manages subsequent operations and maintenance tasks.
This article assumes that as an architect, you've reviewed thestorage optionsand chose Azure Disk Storage as the storage service for your workload. The guidance in this article provides architectural recommendations that are mapped to the principles of theWell-Architected Framework pillars.
This guide focuses on how to make decisions about Azure managed disks. But managed disks are a critical dependency of Azure Virtual Machines. As a prerequisite, read and implement the recommendations inAzure Well-Architected Framework perspective on Virtual Machines and scale sets.

How to use this guide
Each section has adesign checklistthat presents architectural areas of concern along with design strategies localized to the technology scope.
Also included are recommendations for the technology capabilities that can help materialize those strategies. The recommendations don't represent an exhaustive list of all configurations that are available for Azure Disk Storage and its dependencies. Instead, they list the key recommendations mapped to the design perspectives. Use the recommendations to build your proof-of-concept or to optimize your existing environments.
Foundational architecture that demonstrates the key recommendations:Azure Virtual Machines baseline architecture.
Technology scope
This review focuses on the interrelated decisions for the following Azure resources:
Azure Disk Storage
Reliability
The purpose of the Reliability pillar is to provide continued functionality bybuilding enough resilience and the ability to recover fast from failures.
Reliability design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy applied for individual components, system flows, and the system as a whole.
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Reliability. Determine its relevance to your business requirements while keeping in mind the features and capabilities of Azure Disk Storage. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.

Define reliability and recovery targets.Review theAzure service-level agreements (SLAs). The disk types that you attach to your VM affect the VM SLA. For the highest SLA, only use Azure Ultra Disk Storage, Azure Premium SSD v2, or Premium SSD disks for OS and data disks. For guidance about calculating your reliability targets, seeRecommendations for defining reliability targets.

Create a recovery plan.Evaluate data-protection features, backup and restore operations, and failover procedures. Decide whether to use Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, or create your own backup solution by using incremental disk snapshots or restore points. A custom backup solution increases your costs.

Monitor potential availability problems.Subscribe to theAzure Service Health dashboard. Use disk storage metrics in Azure Monitor to help prevent disk throttling. Manually check VMs to ensure that attached disks don't reach their storage capacity. For guidance about how to integrate these metrics into your overall workload health monitoring strategy, seeHealth modeling for workloads.

Security
The purpose of the Security pillar is to provideconfidentiality, integrity, and availabilityguarantees to the workload.
TheSecurity design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those goals by applying approaches to the technical design of Azure Disk Storage.
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Securityand identify vulnerabilities and controls to improve your security posture. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.

Take advantage of encryption options.By default, managed disks are encrypted with server-side encryption (SSE), which helps you protect your data and meet organization and compliance commitments. You might need other configurations and options. You can:Use SSE with encryption keys that you manage.Enableencryption at host.Enable double encryption at rest.For more information, seeServer-side encryption of Azure Disk Storage.

TheCost Optimization design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those goals and making tradeoffs as necessary in the technical design related to Azure Disk Storage.
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Cost Optimizationfor investments. Fine-tune the design so that the workload is aligned with the budget that's allocated for the workload. Your design should use the right Azure capabilities, monitor investments, and find opportunities to optimize over time.

Decide which features you need.Some features, such assnapshotsoron-demand bursting, incur extra transaction costs, capacity costs, and other charges. For example, if you enable snapshots, you're billed for the amount of storage that each snapshot uses. When you decide which capabilities your disks need, review the pricing and billing details for those capabilities.

Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency is aboutmaintaining user experience even when there's an increase in loadby managing capacity. The strategy includes scaling resources, identifying and optimizing potential bottlenecks, and optimizing for peak performance.
ThePerformance Efficiency design principlesprovide a high-level design strategy for achieving those capacity goals against the expected usage.
Design checklist
Start your design strategy based on thedesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency. Define a baseline that's based on key performance indicators for Azure Disk Storage.
Choose optimal disk types.Identify thedisk typesthat you need before you deploy your resources. This approach helps you maximize performance and cost efficiency. The five disk types includeUltra Disk Storage,Premium SSD v2,Premium SSD,Azure Standard SSD, andAzure Standard HDD. For the highest performance, use Premium SSD for your VM's OS disk, and use Ultra Disk Storage or Premium SSD v2 for your data disks.

Reduce the travel distance between the client and server.Place data in regions that are closest to connecting clients, ideally in the same region. Default network configurations provide the best performance. Modify network settings only to improve security. In general, network settings don't decrease travel distance and don't improve performance.

Recommendations
Azure policies
Azure provides an extensive set of built-in policies related to Azure Disk Storage and its dependencies. Some of the preceding recommendations can be audited through Azure Policy. For example, you can check whether:
Public network access to your managed disks is disabled.
Backup is enabled.
Double encryption is enabled.
Specific disk encryption sets are used with your disks.
Customer-managed keys are used.
Managed disks are zone resilient.
Notification policies for key expiration are configured.
Autorotate for customer-managed keys is enabled.
For comprehensive governance, review theAzure Policy built-in definitions for Azure computeand other policies that might impact the security of the storage infrastructure.
