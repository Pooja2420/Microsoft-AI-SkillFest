In this quickstart, learn how to create a NAT gateway by using the Azure CLI. The NAT Gateway service provides outbound connectivity for virtual machines in Azure.

If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Use the Bash environment inAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell.
Use the Bash environment inAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell.

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, seeUse and manage extensions with the Azure CLI.Runaz versionto find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, runaz upgrade.

Create a resource group
Create a resource group withaz group create. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2
Create the NAT gateway
In this section, create the NAT gateway and supporting resources.
Create public IP address
To access the Internet, you need one or more public IP addresses for the NAT gateway. Useaz network public-ip createto create a public IP address resource.
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name public-ip-nat \
    --sku Standard \
    --location eastus2 \
    --zone 1 2 3
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name public-ip-nat \
    --sku Standard \
    --location eastus2 \
    --zone 1 2 3
Create NAT gateway resource
Create an Azure NAT gateway withaz network nat gateway create. The result of this command creates a gateway resource that uses the public IP address defined in the previous step. The idle timeout is set to 10 minutes.
az network nat gateway create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name nat-gateway \
    --public-ip-addresses public-ip-nat \
    --idle-timeout 10 \
    --location eastus2
az network nat gateway create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name nat-gateway \
    --public-ip-addresses public-ip-nat \
    --idle-timeout 10 \
    --location eastus2
Create virtual network
Create a virtual network with a subnet withaz network vnet create. The IP address space for the virtual network is10.0.0.0/16. The subnet within the virtual network is10.0.0.0/24.
az network vnet create \
    --name vnet-1 \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name subnet-1 \
    --subnet-prefixes 10.0.0.0/24 \
    --location eastus2
az network vnet create \
    --name vnet-1 \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name subnet-1 \
    --subnet-prefixes 10.0.0.0/24 \
    --location eastus2
Create bastion host subnet
Create an Azure Bastion host to access the virtual machine.
Useaz network vnet subnet createto create an Azure Bastion subnet.
az network vnet subnet create \
    --name AzureBastionSubnet \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/26
az network vnet subnet create \
    --name AzureBastionSubnet \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/26
Create public IP address for the bastion host
Create a public IP address for the bastion host withaz network public-ip create.
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name public-ip \
    --sku Standard \
    --location eastus2 \
    --zone 1 2 3
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name public-ip \
    --sku Standard \
    --location eastus2 \
    --zone 1 2 3
Create the bastion host
Useaz network bastion createto create the bastion host.
Hourly pricing starts from the moment that Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, seePricingandSKUs. If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource after you finish using it. For more information about Azure Bastion, seeAzure Bastion.
az network bastion create \
    --name bastion \
    --public-ip-address public-ip \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --location eastus2
az network bastion create \
    --name bastion \
    --public-ip-address public-ip \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --location eastus2
The bastion host can take several minutes to deploy. Wait for the bastion host to deploy before moving on to the next section.
Configure NAT service for source subnet
Configure the source subnet in virtual network to use a specific NAT gateway resource withaz network vnet subnet update. This command activates the NAT service on the specified subnet.
az network vnet subnet update \
    --name subnet-1 \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --nat-gateway nat-gateway
az network vnet subnet update \
    --name subnet-1 \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --nat-gateway nat-gateway
All outbound traffic to Internet destinations is now using the NAT gateway.  It's not necessary to configure a UDR.
Create virtual machine
Create a virtual machine to test the NAT gateway to verify the public IP address of the outbound connection.
Create the virtual machine withaz vm create.
az vm create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name vm-1 \
    --image Ubuntu2204 \
    --public-ip-address "" \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --subnet subnet-1 \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --authentication-type password
az vm create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name vm-1 \
    --image Ubuntu2204 \
    --public-ip-address "" \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --subnet subnet-1 \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --authentication-type password
Wait for the virtual machine creation to complete before moving on to the next section.
Test NAT gateway
In this section, you test the NAT gateway. You first discover the public IP of the NAT gateway. You then connect to the test virtual machine and verify the outbound connection through the NAT gateway.

az group delete \
    --name test-rg
az group delete \
    --name test-rg
