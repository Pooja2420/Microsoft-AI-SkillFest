An upgrade brings older search services to the capabilities of new services created in the same region. Specifically, it upgrades the computing power of the underlying service. This one-time operation doesn't introduce breaking changes to your application, and you shouldn't need to change any code.
Foreligible services, an upgrade increases thepartition storageandvector index sizeon the same tier at no extra cost.
Tip
Looking tochange your pricing tier? You can now move up between Basic and Standard (S1, S2, and S3) tiers.
This article describes how to upgrade your service in theAzure portal. Alternatively, you can use theSearch Management REST APIsto upgrade your service programmatically. For more information, seeManage your search service using REST.
About service upgrades
In April 2024, Azure AI Search increased thestorage capacityof newly created search services. Services created before April 2024 saw no capacity changes, so if you wanted larger and faster partitions, you had to create a new service. However, some older services can now be upgraded to benefit from the higher capacity partitions.
In this preview, an upgrade only increases thestorage limitandvector index sizeofeligible services.
Upgrade eligibility
To qualify for an upgrade, your service:
Must have been created before April 2024. Services created after April 2024 should already have higher capacity. To see when you created your service,check your service creation date.
Must be in a region where higher capacity is enabled.
Must be in one of the following regions:East USNorth Central USWest Central USUK South
East US
North Central US
West Central US
UK South
Higher storage limits
Foreligible services, the following table compares the storage limit (per partition) before and after an upgrade.
1Basic services created before April 3, 2024 were originally limited to one partition, which increases to three partitions after an upgrade.Partition counts for all other pricing tiersstay the same.
Higher vector limits
Foreligible services, the following table compares the vector index size (per partition) before and after an upgrade.
1Applies to services created before July 1, 2023.
2Applies to services created between July 1, 2023 and April 3, 2024 in all regions except Germany West Central, Qatar Central, and West India, to which the1limits apply.
Check your service creation or upgrade date
On theOverviewpage, you can view various metadata about your search service, including theCreate date (UTC)andUpgrade date (UTC).

The date you created your service partially determines itsupgrade eligibility. If your service has never been upgraded, theUpgrade date (UTC)doesn't appear.
Upgrade your service
You canât undo a service upgrade. Before you proceed, make sure that you want to permanently increase thestorage limitandvector index sizeof your search service. We recommend that you test this operation in a nonproduction environment.
To upgrade your service:
