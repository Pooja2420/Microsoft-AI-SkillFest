Autoscale allows you to have the right amount of resources running to handle the load on your application. It allows you to add resources to handle increases in load and also save money by removing resources that are sitting idle. SeeOverview of autoscale in Microsoft Azureto learn more about the Autoscale feature of Azure Monitor.
Service Bus Premium Messaging provides resource isolation at the CPU and memory level so that each customer workload runs in isolation. This resource container is called amessaging unit. To learn more about messaging units, seeService Bus Premium Messaging.
By using the Autoscale feature for Service Bus premium namespaces, you can specify a minimum and maximum number ofmessaging unitsand add or remove messaging units automatically based on a set of rules.
For example, you can implement the following scaling scenarios for Service Bus namespaces using the Autoscale feature.
Increase messaging units for a Service Bus namespace when the CPU usage of the namespace goes above 75%.
Decrease messaging units for a Service Bus namespace when the CPU usage of the namespace goes below 25%.
Use more messaging units during business hours and fewer during off hours.
This article shows you how you can automatically scale a Service Bus namespace (updatemessaging units) using the Azure portal and an Azure Resource Manager template.
Important
This article applies to only thepremiumtier of Azure Service Bus.
Configure using the Azure portal
In this section, you learn how to use the Azure portal to configure autoscaling of messaging units for a Service Bus namespace.
Autoscale setting page
First, follow these steps to navigate to theAutoscale settingspage for your Service Bus namespace.
Sign in to theAzure portal.

In the search bar, typeService Bus, selectService Busfrom the drop-down list, and pressENTER.

Custom autoscale - Default condition
You can configure automatic scaling of messaging units by using conditions. This scale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions match. You can set the default condition in one of the following ways:
Scale based on a metric (such as CPU or memory usage)
Scale to specific number of messaging units
You can't set a schedule to autoscale on a specific days or date range for a default condition. This scale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions with schedules match.
Important
Both memory and CPU are crucial resources when setting up Autoscale. It is recommended to establish scale-up and scale-down rules for both.
Note
To improve the receive throughput, Service Bus keeps some messages in its cache. Service Bus trims the cache only when memory usage exceeds a certain high threshold like 80%. So if an entity is sending messages but not receiving them, those messages are cached and it reflects in increased memory usage. Normally this means there is nothing to concern about, as Service Bus trims the cache if needed, which eventually causes the memory usage to go down. However, as memory usage can increase quickly, it is recommended to scale up at 60% memory usage to prevent interruptions of your message processing.
Scale based on a metric
The following procedure shows you how to add a condition to automatically increase messaging units (scale out) when the CPU usage is greater than 75% and decrease messaging units (scale in) when the CPU usage is less than 25%. Increments are done from 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8, and 8 to 16. Similarly, decrements are done from 16 to 8, 8 to 4, 4 to 2, and 2 to 1.

When you are dealing with spiky workloads, we recommend that you have shorter durations for scaling up and longer durations for scaling down. As Service Bus Premium is charged per hour, scaling down quickly will not reduce the costs for that hour. Instead, it is recoomended to give enough time to ensure the reduced workload is stable before scaling down to ensure that there are enough messaging units to process spiky workloads.When scaling down, set the threshold to less than half of the scale-up threshold. For instance, if the scale-up threshold is 80%, set the scale-down threshold to 30-35% (something below 40%) to prevent continuous scaling up and down.This will prevent autoscale to switch between scaling up and down continuously.If you see failures due to lack of capacity (no messaging units available), raise a support ticket with us. Capacity fulfillment is subject to the constraints of the environment and is carried out to our best effort.

Run history
Switch to theRun historytab on theScalepage to see a chart that plots number of messaging units as observed by the autoscale engine. If the chart is empty, it means either autoscale wasn't configured or configured but disabled, or is in a cool down period.

Notifications
Switch to theNotifytab on theScalepage to:
Enable sending notification emails to administrators, co-administrators, and any additional administrators.
Enable sending notification emails to administrators, co-administrators, and any additional administrators.
Enable sending notification emails to an HTTP or HTTPS endpoints exposed by webhooks.
Enable sending notification emails to an HTTP or HTTPS endpoints exposed by webhooks.

Configure using a Resource Manager template
You can use the following sample Resource Manager template to create a Service Bus namespace with a queue, and to configure autoscale settings for the namespace. In this example, two scale conditions are specified.
Default scale condition: increase messaging units when the average CPU usage goes above 75% and decrease messaging units when the average CPU usage goes below 25%.
Assign two messaging units to the namespace on weekends.

You can also generate a JSON example for an autoscale setting resource from the Azure portal. After you configure autoscale settings in the Azure portal, selectJSONon the command bar of theScalepage.

Then, include the JSON in theresourcessection of a Resource Manager template as shown in the preceding example.

Additional considerations
When you use theCustom autoscaleoption with theDefaultcondition or profile,  messaging units are increased (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16) or decreased (16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1) gradually.
When you create additional conditions, the messaging units may not be gradually increased or decreased. Suppose, you have two profiles defined as shown in the following example. At 06:00 UTC, messaging units are set to 16, and at 21:00 UTC, they're reduced to 1.
