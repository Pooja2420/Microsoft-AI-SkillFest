Azure CycleCloud Deployment
Decide which version of CycleCloud will be deployed:Azure CycleCloud 8.2 - Current ReleaseAzure CycleCloud 7.9 - Previous Release
Azure CycleCloud 8.2 - Current Release
Azure CycleCloud 7.9 - Previous Release
Prepare your Azure Subscriptionby defining which Subscription, vNet, Subnet and Resource Group for the CycleCloud server deployment
Define whichResource Groupwill host clusters or if CycleCloud should create them (default setting)
Create a storage account forlocker access
Determine if SSH keys, AD or LDAP will beused for authentication
Determine if CycleCloud will use a Service Principal or a Managed Identity (recommended with a single subscription)Choosing between a Service Principal and a Managed Identity
Confirm which SKU will be used for CycleCloud:CycleCloud System Requirements
Will the environment be deployed in a locked down network? If so, take into account the following requirements:Operating in a locked down network
Deploy the CycleCloud server
Warning
Ensure that "Enable hierarchical namespace" for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 is not set during storage account creation.
CycleCloud is unable to use Blob storage with ADLS Gen 2 enabled as a storage Locker.
Azure CycleCloud Configuration
Login to the CycleCloud server, create a site and a CycleCloud admin account:CycleCloud Setup
Create CycleCloud lockerthat points to the storage account
Azure CycleCloud Cluster Configuration
Define user access to the clustersCluster User Management
Determine which scheduler will be used
Determine which SKU will be required for the scheduler/head node
Determine what SKUs will be required for the compute/execute nodes. This will be entirely dependent on the application being run
Will clusters be deployed using a template or manually?Cluster templates will need to be defined and uploaded to the locker:Cluster Template ReferenceManual creation:Create a New Cluster
Cluster templates will need to be defined and uploaded to the locker:Cluster Template Reference
Manual creation:Create a New Cluster
Will any scripts need to be run on the scheduler or execute nodes once deployed:Cluster-InitCloud-Init
Cluster-Init
Cloud-Init
Applications
What dependencies (libraries, etc) do the applications have? How will these be made available?
How long does an application take to setup and install? This may determine how an application is made available to the execute nodes and could necessitate a custom image.
Are there any license dependencies that need to be taken into account? Does the application need to contact an on-premise license server?
Determine where applications will be executed from, this will be dependent on install times and performance requirements:Through a custom image:Custom Images in a CycleCloud ClusterCreate a Customer Linux ImageUsing a marketplace imageFrom an NFS share, blob storage, Azure NetApp Files

Is there a specific VM SKU which will need to be used for the applications to run on? Will MPI be a requirement as that would necessitate a different family of machines like the H series?Azure VM sizes - HPCHB/HC Cluster Best Practices
Azure VM sizes - HPC
HB/HC Cluster Best Practices
What will be the optimum number of cores per job for each application?
Can spot VMs be used?Using Spot VMs in CycleCloud
Ensuresubscription quotasare in place to fulfill the core requirements for the applications
Data
Determine where in Azure the input data will reside. This will be dependent on the performance of the applications and data size.Locally on the execute nodesFrom an NFS shareIn blob storageUsing Azure NetApp Files
Locally on the execute nodes
From an NFS share
In blob storage
Using Azure NetApp Files
Determine if there is any post-processing needed on the output data
Decide where the output data will reside once processing is complete
Does it need to be copied elsewhere?
What archive/backup requirements are there?
Job Submission
How will users submit jobs?
Will they have a script to run on the scheduler VM or will there be a frontend to help with data upload and job submission?
Backup and Disaster Recovery
Will templates be used for cluster creation? This will make the recreation of a CycleCloud server a lot quicker and consistent across deployments
What requirements for Disaster Recovery are there? What would happen to the business if an Azure region wasnât available as expected?
Are there any application SLAs defined by the internal business?
Could another region be used as a standby?
Are jobs long running? Would checkpointing be beneficial?
