Big data solutions often consist of discrete batch processing tasks that contribute to the overall data processing solution. You can use batch processing for workloads that don't require immediate access to insights. Batch processing can complement real-time processing requirements. You can also use batch processing to balance complexity and reduce cost for your overall implementation.
The fundamental requirement of batch processing engines is to scale out computations to handle a large volume of data. Unlike real-time processing, batch processing has latencies, or the time between data ingestion and computing a result, of minutes or hours.
Choose a technology for batch processing
Microsoft offers several services that you can use to do batch processing.
Microsoft Fabric
Microsoft Fabricis an all-in-one analytics and data platform for organizations. It's a software as a service offering that simplifies how you provision, manage, and govern an end-to-end analytics solution. Fabric handles data movement, processing, ingestion, transformation, and reporting. Fabric features that you use for batch processing include data engineering, data warehouses, lakehouses, and Apache Spark processing. Azure Data Factory in Fabric also supports lakehouses. To simplify and accelerate development, you can enable AI-driven Copilot.

Azure Synapse Analytics
Azure Synapse Analyticsis an enterprise analytics service that brings together both SQL and Spark technologies under a single construct of a workspace. Azure Synapse Analytics simplifies security, governance, and management. Every workspace has integrated data pipelines that you can use to author end-to-end workflows. You can also provision a dedicated SQL pool for large-scale analytics, a serverless SQL endpoint that you can use to directly query the lake, and a Spark runtime for distributed data processing.

Azure Databricks
Azure Databricksis a Spark-based analytics platform. It features rich and premium Spark features that are built on top of open-source Spark. Azure Databricks is a Microsoft service that integrates with the rest of the Azure services. It features extra configurations for Spark cluster deployments. And Unity Catalog helps simplify the governance of Azure Databricks Spark objects.
