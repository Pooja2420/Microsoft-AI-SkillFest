Find a value in Container Logs Table
** This query requires a parameter to run. Container Logs table is used Log lines collected from stdout and stderr streams for containers. This query will find rows in the ContainerLogs table where LogEntry has specified String.
//This qeury requires a parameter to work.
//The ContainerLog table holds Log lines collected from stdout and stderr streams for containers.
//Note: the query runs by default for the last 24 hours. Use the time pikcer to adjust time span for query
let FindString = "";//Please update term  you would like to find in LogEntry here
ContainerLog 
| where LogEntry has FindString 
|take 100

Billable Log Data by log-type
See container logs billable data for the last 7d ,segregated by log-type.
// Set the requested time, anytime greater than 15d can take longer
let billableTimeView = 7d;  
//Join ContainerLog on KubePodInventory for LogEntry source
ContainerLog
| join(KubePodInventory | where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(billableTimeView)))on ContainerID
| where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(billableTimeView))
| summarize Total=sum(_BilledSize)/ 1000 by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), LogEntrySource
// Set the requested time, anytime greater than 15d can take longer
let billableTimeView = 7d;  
//Join ContainerLog on KubePodInventory for LogEntry source
ContainerLog
| join(KubePodInventory | where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(billableTimeView)))on ContainerID
| where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(billableTimeView))
| summarize Total=sum(_BilledSize)/ 1000 by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), LogEntrySource
List container logs per namespace
View container logs from all the namespaces in the cluster.
ContainerLog
|where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(1h))
|join(
KubePodInventory
| where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(1h)) 
| distinct Computer, ContainerID, Namespace
)//KubePodInventory Contains namespace information
on Computer, ContainerID
| project TimeGenerated, ContainerID, Namespace , LogEntrySource , LogEntry
ContainerLog
|where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(1h))
|join(
KubePodInventory
| where TimeGenerated > startofday(ago(1h))

Find In ContainerLog
Find in ContainerLog to search for a specific value in the ContainerLog table./nNote that this query requires updating the <SeachValue> parameter to produce results
// This query requires a parameter to run. Enter value in SearchValue to find in table.
let SearchValue =  "<SearchValue>";//Please update term you would like to find in the table.
ContainerLog
| where * contains tostring(SearchValue)
| take 1000
// This query requires a parameter to run. Enter value in SearchValue to find in table.
