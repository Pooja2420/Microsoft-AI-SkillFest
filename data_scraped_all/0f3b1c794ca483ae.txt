This article covers the steps to set up a new Azure Digital Twins instance, including creating the instance and setting up authentication. After completing this article, you'll have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to start programming against.
This version of this article goes through these steps manually, one by one, using the Azure portal. The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.
Full setup for a new Azure Digital Twins instance consists of two parts:
Creating the instance
Setting up user access permissions: Azure users need to have theAzure Digital Twins Data Ownerrole on the Azure Digital Twins instance to be able to manage it and its data. In this step, you as an Owner/administrator of the Azure subscription will assign this role to the person who will be managing your Azure Digital Twins instance. This may be yourself or someone else in your organization.
Important
To complete this full article and completely set up a usable instance, you need permissions to manage both resources and user access on the Azure subscription. The first step can be completed by anyone who's able to create resources on the subscription, but the second step requires user access management permissions (or the cooperation of someone with these permissions). You can read more about this in thePrerequisites: Required permissionssection for the user access permission step.
Create the Azure Digital Twins instance
In this section, you create a new instance of Azure Digital Twins using theAzure portal. Navigate to the portal and sign in with your credentials.
Once in the portal, start by selectingCreate a resourcein the Azure services home page menu.
Once in the portal, start by selectingCreate a resourcein the Azure services home page menu.

Search forAzure Digital Twinsin the search box, and choose theAzure Digital Twinsservice from the results.Leave thePlanfield set toAzure Digital Twinsand select theCreatebutton to start creating a new instance of the service.

On the followingCreate Resourcepage, fill in the following values:Subscription: The Azure subscription you're using.Resource group: A resource group in which to deploy the instance. If you don't already have an existing resource group in mind, you can create one here by selecting theCreate newlink and entering a name for a new resource group.Resource name: A name for your Azure Digital Twins instance. If your subscription has another Azure Digital Twins instance in the region that's already using the specified name, you are asked to pick a different name.Region: An Azure Digital Twins-enabled region for the deployment. For more details on regional support, visitAzure products available by region (Azure Digital Twins).Grant access to resource: Checking the box in this section gives your Azure account permission to access and manage data in the instance. If you're the one that will be managing the instance, you should check this box now. If it's greyed out because you don't have permission in the subscription, you can continue creating the resource and have someone with the required permissions grant you the role later. For more information about this role and assigning roles to your instance, see the next section,Set up user access permissions.

When you're finished, you can selectReview + createif you don't want to configure any more settings for your instance. Doing so takes you to a summary page, where you can review the instance details that you entered and finish withCreate.If you do want to configure more details for your instance, the next section describes the remaining setup tabs.

If you do want to configure more details for your instance, the next section describes the remaining setup tabs.
Additional setup options
Here are the additional options you can configure during setup, using the other tabs in theCreate Resourceprocess.
Networking: In this tab, you can enable private endpoints withAzure Private Linkto eliminate public network exposure to your instance. For instructions, seeEnable private access with Private Link.
Advanced: In this tab, you can enable a system-assignedmanaged identityfor your instance. When this option is enabled, Azure automatically creates an identity for the instance inMicrosoft Entra ID, which can be used to authenticate to other services. You can enable that system-assigned managed identity while you're creating the instance here, orlater on an existing instance. If you want to enable a user-assigned managed identity instead, you need to do it later on an existing instance.
Tags: In this tab, you can add tags to your instance to help you organize it among your Azure resources. For more about Azure resource tags, seeTag resources, resource groups, and subscriptions for logical organization.
Verify success and collect important values
After finishing your instance setup by selectingCreate, you can view the status of your instance's deployment in your Azure notifications along the portal icon bar. The notification indicates when deployment succeeds, at which point you can select theGo to resourcebutton to view your created instance.

If deployment fails, the notification indicates why. Observe the advice from the error message and retry creating the instance.
Tip
Once your instance is created, you can return to its page at any time by searching for the name of your instance in the Azure portal search bar.
From the instance'sOverviewpage, note itsName,Resource group, andHost name. These values are all important and you might need to use them as you continue working with your Azure Digital Twins instance. If other users will be programming against the instance, you should share these values with them.

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go. Next, you'll give the appropriate Azure user permissions to manage it.
Set up user access permissions
Azure Digital Twins usesMicrosoft Entra IDfor role-based access control (RBAC). This means that before a user can make data plane calls to your Azure Digital Twins instance, that user needs to be assigned a role with appropriate permissions for it.
For Azure Digital Twins, this role isAzure Digital Twins Data Owner. You can read more about roles and security inSecurity for Azure Digital Twins solutions.
Note
This role is different from the Microsoft Entra IDOwnerrole, which can also be assigned at the scope of the Azure Digital Twins instance. These are two distinct management roles, and Owner does not grant access to data plane features that are granted withAzure Digital Twins Data Owner.
This section will show you how to create a role assignment for a user in your Azure Digital Twins instance, using that user's email in the Microsoft Entra tenant on your Azure subscription. Depending on your role in your organization, you might set up this permission for yourself, or set it up on behalf of someone else who will be managing the Azure Digital Twins instance.
There are two ways to create a role assignment for a user in Azure Digital Twins:
During Azure Digital Twins instance creation
Using Azure Identity Management (IAM)
They both require the same permissions.
Prerequisites: Permission requirements
To be able to complete all the following steps, you need to have arole in your subscriptionthat has the following permissions:
Create and manage Azure resources
Manage user access to Azure resources (including granting and delegating permissions)
Common roles that meet this requirement areOwner,Account admin, or the combination ofUser Access AdministratorandContributor. For a complete explanation of roles and permissions, including what permissions are included with other roles, visitAzure roles, Microsoft Entra roles, and classic subscription administrator rolesin the Azure RBAC documentation.
To view your role in your subscription, visit theSubscriptions pagein the Azure portal (you can use this link or look forSubscriptionswith the portal search bar). Look for the name of the subscription you're using, and view your role for it in theMy rolecolumn:

If you find that the value isContributor, or another role that doesn't have the required permissions previously described, you can contact the user on your subscription that does have these permissions (such as a subscription Owner or Account admin) and proceed in one of the following ways:
Request that they complete the role assignment steps on your behalf.
Request that they elevate your role on the subscription so that you have the permissions to proceed yourself. Whether this request is appropriate can depend on your organization and your role within it.
Assign the role during instance creation
While creating your Azure Digital Twins resource through the process describedearlier in this article, select theAssign Azure Digital Twins Data Owner RoleunderGrant access to resource. Doing so grants yourself full access to the data plane APIs.

If you don't have permission to assign a role to an identity, the box appears greyed out.

In that case, you can still continue to successfully create the Azure Digital Twins resource, but someone with the appropriate permissions needs to assign this role to you or to the person who will manage the instance's data.
Assign the role using Azure Identity Management (IAM)
You can also assign theAzure Digital Twins Data Ownerrole using the access control options in Azure Identity Management (IAM).
First, open the page for your Azure Digital Twins instance in the Azure portal.

Verify success
You can view the role assignment you set up underAccess control (IAM) > Role assignments. The user should show up in the list with a role ofAzure Digital Twins Data Owner.

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go, and assigned permissions to manage it.
Enable/disable managed identity for the instance
This section shows you how to add a managed identity (either system-assigned or user-assigned) to an existing Azure Digital Twins instance. You can also use this page to disable managed identity on an instance that has it already.
Start by opening theAzure portalin a browser.
Search for the name of your instance in the portal search bar, and select it to view its details.
Search for the name of your instance in the portal search bar, and select it to view its details.

Considerations for disabling managed identities
It's important to consider the effects that any changes to the identity or its roles can have on the resources that use it. If you'reusing managed identities with your Azure Digital Twins endpointsor fordata historyand the identity is disabled, or a necessary role is removed from it, the endpoint or data history connection can become inaccessible and the flow of events is disrupted.
Next steps
Test out individual REST API calls on your instance using the Azure Digital Twins CLI commands:
az dt reference
