In this quickstart, you learn how to create an Azure Route Server to peer with a network virtual appliance (NVA) in your virtual network using the Azure portal.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Important
Route servers created before November 1, 2021, without an associated public IP address, were deployed with thepublic previewoffering. The public preview offering doesn't include General Availability SLA and support. To deploy a route server with the General Availability offering and qualify for the General Availability SLA and support, delete and recreate your route server.

Set up peering with NVA
In this section, you learn how to configure BGP peering with a network virtual appliance (NVA).

On theAdd Peerpage, enter the following information:SettingValueNameA name to identify the peer. It doesn't have to be the same name of the NVA.ASNThe Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the NVA. For more information, seeWhat Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) can I use?IPv4 AddressThe private IP address of the NVA thatmyRouteServerwill communicate with to establish BGP.
On theAdd Peerpage, enter the following information:
SelectAddto add the peer.
SelectAddto add the peer.

Complete the configuration on the NVA
To complete the peering setup, you must configure the NVA to establish a BGP session with the route server using its IP addresses and ASN. You can find the IP addresses and ASN ofmyRouteServerin theOverviewpage:

Important
Peer the NVA with both route server instance IPs to ensure virtual network routes are advertised over the NVA connections and achieve high availability.
Clean up resources
When no longer needed, you can delete all resources created in this quickstart by deletingmyResourceGroupresource group:
In the search box at the top of the portal, entermyResourceGroup. SelectmyResourceGroupfrom the search results.
