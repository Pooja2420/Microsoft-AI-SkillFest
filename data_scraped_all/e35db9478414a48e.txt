This article provides information on using the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1. The SDK v1 is deprecated as of March 31, 2025 and support for it will end on June 30, 2026. You're able to install and use the SDK v1 until that date.
We recommend that you transition to the SDK v2 before June 30, 2026. For more information on the SDK v2, seeWhat is the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2and theSDK v2 reference.
In this how-to article, you learn how to use Azure Machine Learning designer to retrain a machine learning model using pipeline parameters. You will use published pipelines to automate your workflow and set parameters to train your model on new data. Pipeline parameters let you re-use existing pipelines for different jobs.
In this article, you learn how to:
Train a machine learning model.
Create a pipeline parameter.
Publish your training pipeline.
Retrain your model with new parameters.
Prerequisites
An Azure Machine Learning workspace

Important
If you do not see graphical elements mentioned in this document, such as buttons in studio or designer, you may not have the right level of permissions to the workspace. Please contact your Azure subscription administrator to verify that you have been granted the correct level of access. For more information, seeManage users and roles.
This article also assumes that you have some knowledge of building pipelines in the designer. For a guided introduction, complete thetutorial.
Sample pipeline
The pipeline used in this article is an altered version of a sample pipelineIncome predictionin the designer homepage. The pipeline uses theImport Datacomponent instead of the sample dataset to show you how to train models using your own data.

Create a pipeline parameter
Pipeline parameters are used to build versatile pipelines which can be resubmitted later with varying parameter values. Some common scenarios are updating datasets or some hyper-parameters for retraining. Create pipeline parameters to dynamically set variables at runtime.
Pipeline parameters can be added to data source or component parameters in a pipeline. When the pipeline is resubmitted, the values of these parameters can be specified.
For this example, you will change the training data path from a fixed value to a parameter, so that you can retrain your model on different data. You can also add other component parameters as pipeline parameters according to your use case.
Select theImport Datacomponent.NoteThis example uses the Import Data component to access data in a registered datastore. However, you can follow similar steps if you use alternative data access patterns.

Publish a training pipeline
Publish a pipeline to a pipeline endpoint to easily reuse your pipelines in the future. A pipeline endpoint creates a REST endpoint to invoke pipeline in the future. In this example, your pipeline endpoint lets you reuse your pipeline to retrain a model on different data.

Select or create a pipeline endpoint.NoteYou can publish multiple pipelines to a single endpoint. Each pipeline in a given endpoint is given a version number, which you can specify when you call the pipeline endpoint.

SelectPublish.
SelectPublish.
Retrain your model
Now that you have a published training pipeline, you can use it to retrain your model on new data. You can submit jobs from a pipeline endpoint from the studio workspace or programmatically.
Submit jobs by using the studio portal
Use the following steps to submit a parameterized pipeline endpoint job from the studio portal:
Go to theEndpointspage in your studio workspace.
Select thePipeline endpointstab. Then, select your pipeline endpoint.
Select thePublished pipelinestab. Then, select the pipeline version that you want to run.
SelectSubmit.
In the setup dialog box, you can specify the parameters values for the job. For this example, update the data path to train your model using a non-US dataset.

Submit jobs by using code
You can find the REST endpoint of a published pipeline in the overview panel. By calling the endpoint, you can retrain the published pipeline.
To make a REST call, you need an OAuth 2.0 bearer-type authentication header. For information about setting up authentication to your workspace and making a parameterized REST call, seeUse REST to manage resources.
