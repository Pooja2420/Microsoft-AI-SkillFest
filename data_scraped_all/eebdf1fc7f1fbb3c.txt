All visualizations that are created in the context of therender operatorare available in dashboard visualizations. However, the following visualizations are only available inAzure Data Explorer dashboards, Real-Time Dashboards, orAzure Data Explorer web UI, and not with the render operator.

Funnel chart
A funnel chart visualizes a linear process that has sequential, connected stages. Each funnel stage represents a percentage of the total. So, in most cases, a funnel chart is shaped like a funnel, with the first stage being the largest, and each subsequent stage smaller than its predecessor.
The following example uses data from theContosoSalesdatabase from the publicly availablehelp clusterto show the number of sales for washers and dryers in Canada out of the total sum of sales in 2007.
ContosoSales
Example query
let interestingSales = SalesTable
| where DateKey between (datetime(2007) .. datetime(2008))
| join kind=inner Products on ProductKey;
let totalSales = interestingSales
| summarize sum(SalesAmount)
| extend Name="Total";
//totalSales
let homeAppliancesSales = interestingSales
| where ProductCategoryName == "Home Appliances"
| summarize sum(SalesAmount)
| extend Name="Home Appliances";
//homeAppliancesSales
let washersAndDryersSales = interestingSales
| where ProductCategoryName == "Home Appliances"
| where ProductSubcategoryName == "Washers & Dryers"
| summarize sum(SalesAmount)
| extend Name="Washers & Dryers";
//washersAndDryersSales
let canadaSales = interestingSales
| where ProductCategoryName == "Home Appliances"
| where ProductSubcategoryName == "Washers & Dryers"
| where Country == "Canada"
| summarize sum(SalesAmount)
| extend Name="Canada";
//canadaSales
totalSales
| union homeAppliancesSales
| union washersAndDryersSales
| union canadaSales
| project Name, SalesAmount=sum_SalesAmount
| sort by SalesAmount desc

Heatmap
A heatmap shows values for a main variable of interest across two axis variables as a grid of colored squares.
To render a heatmap, the query must generate a table with three columns. The data used for thevaluefield must be numeric. The columns that will be used forxandyvalues use the following rules:
If the values in columnxare in thestringformat, the values in columnymust be in thestringformat.
string
string
If the values in columnxare in thedatetimeformat, the values in columnymust be numeric.
datetime
Note
We recommend specifying each data field, instead of letting the tool infer the data source.
