CLR security
Title: CLR assemblies marked as SAFE or EXTERNAL_ACCESS are considered UNSAFECategory: Warning
DescriptionCLR Strict Security mode is enforced in Azure SQL Managed Instance. This mode is enabled by default and introduces breaking changes for databases containing user-defined CLR assemblies marked either SAFE or EXTERNAL_ACCESS.
Recommendation
CLR uses Code Access Security (CAS) in the .NET Framework, which is no longer supported as a security boundary. A CLR assembly created withPERMISSION_SET = SAFEmight be able to access external system resources, call unmanaged code, and acquire sysadmin privileges. In SQL Server 2017 (14.x) and later versions, thesp_configureoption,clr strict security, enhances the security of CLR assemblies.clr strict securityis enabled by default, and treatsSAFEandEXTERNAL_ACCESSassemblies as if they were markedUNSAFE. Theclr strict securityoption can be disabled for backward compatibility, but isn't recommended.
PERMISSION_SET = SAFE

We recommend that you sign all assemblies by a certificate or asymmetric key, with a corresponding login that has been grantedUNSAFE ASSEMBLYpermission in themasterdatabase. SQL Server administrators can also add assemblies to a list of assemblies, which the Database Engine should trust. For more information, seesys.sp_add_trusted_assembly.
UNSAFE ASSEMBLY
master
COMPUTE clause
Title: COMPUTE clause is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Warning
DescriptionThe COMPUTE clause generates totals that appear as additional summary columns at the end of the result set. However, this clause is no longer supported in Azure SQL Managed Instance.
RecommendationThe T-SQL module needs to be rewritten using the ROLLUP operator instead. The following code demonstrates how COMPUTE can be replaced with ROLLUP:
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
ORDER BY SalesOrderID COMPUTE SUM(UnitPrice),
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) BY SalesOrderID;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount,
    SUM(UnitPrice) AS UnitPrice,
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) AS UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
GROUP BY SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
WITH ROLLUP;
USE AdventureWorks2022;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
ORDER BY SalesOrderID COMPUTE SUM(UnitPrice),
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) BY SalesOrderID;
GO

SELECT SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount,
    SUM(UnitPrice) AS UnitPrice,
    SUM(UnitPriceDiscount) AS UnitPriceDiscount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
GROUP BY SalesOrderID,
    UnitPrice,
    UnitPriceDiscount
WITH ROLLUP;

Linked server (non-SQL provider)
Title: Linked server with non-SQL Server Provider is not supported in Azure SQL Managed Instance.Category: Issue
DescriptionLinked servers enable the SQL Server Database Engine to execute commands against OLE DB data sources outside of the instance of SQL Server. Linked server with non-SQL Server Provider isn't supported in Azure SQL Managed Instance.
RecommendationAzure SQL Managed Instance doesn't support linked server functionality if the remote server provider is non-SQL Server like Oracle, Sybase etc.
The following actions are recommended to eliminate the need for linked servers:
Identify the dependent databases from remote non-SQL servers and consider moving these into the database being migrated.
Migrate the dependent databases to supported targets like SQL Managed Instance, SQL Database, Azure Synapse, and SQL Server instances.
Consider creating linked server between Azure SQL Managed Instance and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (SQL VM). Then from the SQL VM, create a linked server to Oracle, Sybase, etc. This approach does involve two hops but can be used as temporary workaround.
Alternatively, migrate to SQL Server on Azure VMs.

More information:Hardware characteristics of Azure SQL Managed Instance
Multiple log files
Title: Azure SQL Managed Instance does not support multiple log files.Category: Issue
DescriptionSQL Server allows a database to log to multiple files. This database has multiple log files, which isn't supported in Azure SQL Managed Instance.This database can't be migrated as the backup can't be restored on Azure SQL Managed Instance.
RecommendationAzure SQL Managed Instance supports only a single log per database. You need to delete all but one of the log files before migrating this database to Azure:
ALTER DATABASE [database_name] REMOVE FILE [log_file_name]
ALTER DATABASE [database_name] REMOVE FILE [log_file_name]
More information:Unsupported database options in Azure SQL Managed Instance
Next column
Title: Tables and Columns named NEXT will lead to an error In Azure SQL Managed Instance.Category: Issue
DescriptionTables or columns named NEXT were detected. Sequences, introduced in Microsoft SQL Server, use the ANSI standard NEXT VALUE FOR function. Tables or columns named NEXT and column aliased as VALUE with the ANSI standard AS omitted can cause an error.
RecommendationRewrite statements to include the ANSI standard AS keyword when aliasing a table or column. For example, when a column is named NEXT and that column is aliased as VALUE, the query SELECT NEXT VALUE FROM TABLE causes an error, and should be rewritten as SELECT NEXT AS VALUE FROM TABLE. Similarly, for a table named NEXT and aliased as VALUE, the query SELECT Col1 FROM NEXT VALUE causes an error, and should be rewritten as SELECT Col1 FROM NEXT AS VALUE.
Non-ANSI style left outer join
Title: Non-ANSI style left outer join is no longer supported and has been removed.Category: Warning
DescriptionNon-ANSI style left outer join is no longer supported and has been removed in Azure SQL Managed Instance.
