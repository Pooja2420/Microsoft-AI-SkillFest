This article outlines the technical prerequisites, supported environments, and specifications required for successfully onboarding physical and virtual servers to Azure Arc-enabled servers. It serves as a reference for administrators and engineers planning to implement Azure Arc in their environments. Someonboarding methodsmay have more requirements.
Supported environments
Azure Arc-enabled servers support the installation of the Connected Machine agent on physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, including on platforms like:
VMware (including Azure VMware Solution)
Azure Local
Other cloud environments
Note
You shouldn't install Azure Arc on virtual machines hosted in Azure, Azure Stack Hub, or Azure Stack Edge, as they already have similar capabilities. You can, however,use an Azure VM to simulate an on-premises environmentfor testing purposes, only.
Cloned and golden image considerations
Take extra care when using Azure Arc on systems that are:
Cloned
Restored from backup as a second instance of the server
Used to create a "golden image" from which other virtual machines are created
If two agents use the same source id, you'll encounter inconsistent behaviors when both agents try to act as one Azure resource. The best practice for these situations is to use an automation tool or script to onboard the server to Azure Arc after its cloned, restored from backup, or created from a golden image. For more information about cloning machines to use as Arc-enabled servers, seeCloning guidelines.
Note
For more information on using Azure Arc-enabled servers in VMware environments, see theVMware FAQ.
Supported operating systems
Azure Arc supports Windows and Linux operating systems as listed in the table. x86-64 (64-bit) architecture is fully supported, while only some features are supported on Arm64 as noted in the table. The Azure Connected Machine agent doesn't run on 32-bit architectures.
For Windows Server, both Desktop and Server Core experiences are supported. Azure Editions are supported on Azure Local.
The Azure Connected Machine agent isn't tested on operating systems hardened by the Center for Information Security (CIS) Benchmark.
Arm64 architecture support
Not all features, virtual machine extensions, and services are supported on Arm64 at this point. For full details on Arm64 compatibility or to check if other services are supported, refer to the documentation for the service you wish to use. The following are a few features known to be supported on Arm64:
RunCommand
CustomScriptExtension
Azure Monitor Agent
Note
Machine configuration is not compatible with Arm64 at this time.
Limited support operating systems
The following operating system versions havelimited support. In each case, newer agent versions won't support these operating systems. The last agent version that supports the operating system is listed, and newer agent releases won't be made available for that system.
The listed version is supported until theEnd of Arc Support Date. If critical security issues are identified that affect these agent versions, the fixes can be backported to the last supported version but new functionality or other bug fixes won't be.
Connect new limited support servers
To connect a new server running a Limited Support operating system to Azure Arc, you will need to make some adjustments to the onboarding script.
For Windows, modify the installation script to specify the version required, using the -AltDownload parameter.
Instead of
# Install the hybrid agent
    & "$env:TEMP\install_windows_azcmagent.ps1";
# Install the hybrid agent
    & "$env:TEMP\install_windows_azcmagent.ps1";
Use
# Install the hybrid agent
    & "$env:TEMP\install_windows_azcmagent.ps1" -AltDownload https://aka.ms/AzureConnectedMachineAgent-1.39;
# Install the hybrid agent
    & "$env:TEMP\install_windows_azcmagent.ps1" -AltDownload https://aka.ms/AzureConnectedMachineAgent-1.39;
For Linux, the relevant package repository will only contain releases that are applicable, so no special considerations are required.
Client operating system guidance
The Azure Arc service and Azure Connected Machine Agent are supported on Windows 10 and 11 client operating systems only when using those computers in a server-like environment. That is, the computer should always be:
Connected to the internet
Connected to a power source
Powered on
For example, a computer running Windows 11 that's responsible for digital signage, point-of-sale solutions, and general back office management tasks is a good candidate for Azure Arc. End-user productivity machines, such as a laptop, which may go offline for long periods of time, shouldn't use Azure Arc and instead should considerMicrosoft IntuneorMicrosoft Configuration Manager.
Short-lived servers and virtual desktop infrastructure
Microsoft doesn't recommend running Azure Arc on short-lived (ephemeral) servers or virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) VMs. Azure Arc is designed for long-term management of servers and isn't optimized for scenarios where you are regularly creating and deleting servers. For example, Azure Arc doesn't know if the agent is offline due to planned system maintenance or if the VM was deleted, so it won't automatically clean up server resources that stopped sending heartbeats. As a result, you could encounter a conflict if you re-create the VM with the same name and there's an existing Azure Arc resource with the same name.
Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure Localdoesn't use short-lived VMs and supports running Azure Arc in the desktop VMs.
Software and system requirements
This section details the software requirements for the Azure Connected Machine agent.
Windows operating system requirements
Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 requires PowerShell 4.0 or later. Microsoft recommends running the latest version,Windows Management Framework 5.1.
Linux operating system requirements
systemd
wget (to download the installation script)
openssl
gnupg (Debian-based systems, only)
Local user logon right for Windows systems
The Azure Hybrid Instance Metadata Service runs under a low-privileged virtual account,NT SERVICE\himds. This account needs the "log on as a service" right in Windows to run. In most cases, there's nothing you need to do because this right is granted to virtual accounts by default. However, if your organization uses Group Policy to customize this setting, you'll need to addNT SERVICE\himdsto the list of accounts allowed to log on as a service.
NT SERVICE\himds
NT SERVICE\himds
You can check the current policy on your machine by opening the Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) from the Start menu and navigating to the following policy item:
gpedit.msc
Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment > Log on as a service
Check if any ofNT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES,NT SERVICE\himds, orS-1-5-80-4215458991-2034252225-2287069555-1155419622-2701885083(the static security identifier for NT SERVICE\himds) are in the list. If none are in the list, you'll need to work with your Group Policy administrator to addNT SERVICE\himdsto any policies that configure user rights assignments on your servers. The Group Policy administrator needs to make the change on a computer with the Azure Connected Machine agent installed so the object picker resolves the identity correctly. The agent doesn't need to be configured or connected to Azure to make this change.
NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES
NT SERVICE\himds
S-1-5-80-4215458991-2034252225-2287069555-1155419622-2701885083
NT SERVICE\himds

Required permissions
You'll need the following Azure built-in roles for different aspects of managing connected machines:
To onboard machines, you must have theAzure Connected Machine OnboardingorContributorrole for the resource group where you're managing the servers.
To read, modify, and delete a machine, you must have theAzure Connected Machine Resource Administratorrole for the resource group.
To select a resource group from the drop-down list when using theGenerate scriptmethod, you'll also need theReaderrole for that resource group (or another role that includesReaderaccess).
When associating a Private Link Scope with an Arc Server, you must have Microsoft.HybridCompute/privateLinkScopes/read permission on the Private Link Scope Resource.
Azure resource providers
The followingAzure resource providersmust be registered in your subscription to use Azure Arc-enabled servers.
:
Microsoft.HybridCompute
Microsoft.GuestConfiguration
Microsoft.HybridConnectivity
Microsoft.AzureArcData(if you plan to Arc-enable SQL Servers)
Microsoft.Compute(for Azure Update Manager and automatic extension upgrades)
You can register the resource providers using the following commands:
Azure PowerShell:
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId [subscription you want to onboard]
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.HybridCompute
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.GuestConfiguration
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.HybridConnectivity
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AzureArcData
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId [subscription you want to onboard]
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.HybridCompute
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.GuestConfiguration
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.HybridConnectivity
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AzureArcData
Azure CLI:
az account set --subscription "{Your Subscription Name}"
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.HybridCompute'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.GuestConfiguration'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.HybridConnectivity'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.AzureArcData'
az account set --subscription "{Your Subscription Name}"
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.HybridCompute'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.GuestConfiguration'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.HybridConnectivity'
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.AzureArcData'
You can also register the resource providers in theAzure portal.
