Troubleshoot common Azure Virtual Desktop Agent issues
Article

In this article
The Azure Virtual Desktop Agent can cause connection issues because of multiple factors:
An error on the broker that makes the agent stop the service.
Problems with updates.
Issues with installing during the agent installation, which disrupts the connection to the session host.
This article guides you through solutions to these common scenarios and how to address connection issues.
Note
For troubleshooting issues related to session connectivity and the Azure Virtual Desktop agent, we recommend you review the event logs on your session host virtual machines (VMs) by going toEvent Viewer>Windows Logs>Application. Look for events that have one of the following sources to identify your issue:
WVD-Agent
WVD-Agent-Updater
RDAgentBootLoader
MsiInstaller
Error: The RDAgentBootLoader and/or Remote Desktop Agent Loader has stopped running
If you see any of the following issues, it means that the boot loader, which loads the agent, was unable to install the agent properly and the agent service isn't running on your session host VM:
RDAgentBootLoaderis either stopped or not running.
There's no status forRemote Desktop Agent Loader.
To resolve this issue, start the RDAgent boot loader:
In theServiceswindow, right-clickRemote Desktop Agent Loader.
SelectStart. If this option is greyed out, you don't have administrator permissions. You need to get those permissions to start the service.
Wait 10 seconds, and then right-clickRemote Desktop Agent Loader.
SelectRefresh.
If the service stops after you start and refresh it, you might have a registration failure. For more information, seeINVALID_REGISTRATION_TOKEN or EXPIRED_MACHINE_TOKEN.
Error: INVALID_REGISTRATION_TOKEN or EXPIRED_MACHINE_TOKEN
On your session host VM, go toEvent Viewer>Windows Logs>Application. If you see an event with ID 3277 with the descriptionINVALID_REGISTRATION_TOKENorEXPIRED_MACHINE_TOKEN, the registration key that has been used isn't recognized as valid.

Error: Session hosts are stuck in the Unavailable state
If your session host VMs are stuck in the Unavailable state, your VM didn't pass one of the health checks listed inHealth check. You must resolve the issue that's causing the VM to fail the health check.
Error: Session hosts are stuck in the Needs Assistance state
Several health checks can cause your session host VMs to be stuck in theNeeds Assistancestate:UrlsAccessibleCheck,MetaDataServiceCheck, andMonitoringAgentCheck.
UrlsAccessibleCheck
If the session host doesn't pass theUrlsAccessibleCheckhealth check, you need to identify whichrequired URLyour deployment is currently blocking. Once you know which URL is blocked, identify which setting is blocking that URL and remove it.
There are two reasons why the service is blocking a required URL:
You have an active firewall that's blocking most outbound traffic and access to the required URLs.
Your local hosts file is blocking the required websites.
To resolve a firewall-related issue, add a rule that allows outbound connections to the TCP port 80/443 associated with the blocked URLs.
If your local hosts file is blocking the required URLs, make sure none of the required URLs are in theHostsfile on your device. You can find the Hosts file location at the following registry key and value:
Key:HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
Type:REG_EXPAND_SZ
REG_EXPAND_SZ
Name:DataBasePath
DataBasePath
MetaDataServiceCheck
If the session host doesn't pass theMetaDataServiceCheckhealth check, the service can't access the IMDS endpoint. To resolve this issue, you need to do the following things:
Reconfigure your networking, firewall, or proxy settings to unblock the IP address 169.254.169.254.
Make sure your HTTP clients bypass web proxies within the VM when querying IMDS. We recommend that you allow the required IP address in any firewall policies within the VM that deal with outbound network traffic direction.
If your issue is caused by a web proxy, add an exception for 169.254.169.254 in the web proxy's configuration. To add this exception, open an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell session and run the following command:
netsh winhttp set proxy proxy-server="http=<customerwebproxyhere>" bypass-list="169.254.169.254"
netsh winhttp set proxy proxy-server="http=<customerwebproxyhere>" bypass-list="169.254.169.254"
MonitoringAgentCheck
If the session host doesn't pass theMonitoringAgentCheckhealth check, you need to check the Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Geneva Agent and validate if it's functioning correctly on the session host:
Verify if the Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Geneva Agent is installed on the session host. You can verify this in the list of installed programs on the session host. If you see multiple versions of this agent installed, uninstall older versions and keep only the latest version installed.
If you don't find the Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Geneva Agent installed on the session host, review logs located underC:\Program Files\Microsoft RDInfra\GenevaInstall.txtand see if installation is failing due to an error.
Verify if the scheduled taskGenevaTask_<version>is created. This scheduled task must be enabled and running. If it's not, reinstall the agent using the.msifile namedMicrosoft.RDInfra.Geneva.Installer-x64-<version>.msi, which is available atC:\Program Files\Microsoft RDInfra.

Step 4: Reinstall the agent and boot loader
Reinstalling the latest version of the agent and boot loader also automatically installs the side-by-side stack and Geneva monitoring agent. To reinstall the agent and boot loader, follow these steps. This is the latest downloadable version of the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent innon-validation environments. For more information about the rollout of new versions of the agent, seeWhat's new in the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent.

Remove the DisableRegistryTools registry key
If you've performed all four steps but the agent still doesn't work, it might be because theDisableRegistryToolsregistry key is enabled in one of the following locations:
DisableRegistryTools
HKU:\DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableRegistryTools=1
\DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableRegistryTools
1
HKU:\S-1-5-18\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableRegistryTools=1
\S-1-5-18\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableRegistryTools
1
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableRegistryTools=1
\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableRegistryTools
1
This registry key prevents the agent from installing the side-by-side stack, which results in an installMSIException error. This error leads to the session hosts being stuck in an unavailable state.
To resolve this issue, you need to remove the key:
Remove theDisableRegistryToolskey from the three previously listed locations.
DisableRegistryTools
Uninstall and remove the affected side-by-side stack installation from theApps & Featuresfolder.
Remove the affected side-by-side stack's registry keys.
Restart your VM.
Start the agent and let it auto-install the side-by-side stack.
