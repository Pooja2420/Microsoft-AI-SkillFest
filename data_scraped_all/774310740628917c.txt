The language extensions feature allows you to use language extension plugins to integrate other languages into your Azure Data Explorer KQL queries. The plugin's runtime is hosted in asandbox, an isolated and secure environment, running on the cluster's nodes. In this article, you manage the language extensions plugin in your Azure Data Explorer cluster within the Azure portal.
Prerequisites
An Azure subscription. Create afree Azure account.
An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database.Create a cluster and database.
Review thelimitations. Note that language extensions can only be enabled on SKUs that supportnested virtualization.
Cluster AllDatabasesAdmin permissions.Manage Azure Data Explorer cluster permissions.

After the image is created you can edit or delete it.
Requirements file
Supported requirements files are in the format ofpip requirements.txtand can include any Python package. Each line contains the name of a package, optionally followed by the package number. For example:

arrow==1.3.0
attrs==23.2.0
Disable language extensions on your cluster
Note
Disabling the image process can take up to 30 minutes. The process doesn't impact cluster availability.
Do the following steps to disable language extensions on your cluster:
In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Data Explorer cluster.
InSettings, selectConfigurations.
In theConfigurationspane, selectOffto disable a language extension.
SelectSave.
Limitations
The language extensions runtime sandbox allocates disk space even if no query runs in the scope of the relevant language. For more detailed limitations, seesandboxes.
