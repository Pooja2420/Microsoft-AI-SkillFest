This article shows you how to create a new metric alert rule or edit an existing metric alert rule. To learn more about alerts, see thealerts overview.
You create an alert rule by combining the resources to be monitored, the monitoring data from the resource, and the conditions that you want to trigger the alert. You can then defineaction groupsandalert processing rulesto determine what happens when an alert is triggered.
You can define what payload is included in alerts triggered by these alert rules. They can contain a payload that uses thecommon alert schema, or less-recommendedindividualized schemas per alert type.
Prerequisites
To create a metric alert rule, you must have the following permissions:
Read permission on the target resource of the alert rule.
Write permission on the resource group in which the alert rule is created. If you're creating the alert rule from the Azure portal, the alert rule is created by default in the same resource group in which the target resource resides.
Read permission on any action group associated to the alert rule, if applicable.

Preview the results of the selected metric signal in thePreviewsection. Select values for the following fields.
In theAlert logicsection:FieldDescriptionThresholdSelect if the threshold should be evaluated based on a static value or a dynamic value.Astatic thresholdevaluates the rule by using the threshold value that you configure.Dynamic thresholdsuse machine learning algorithms to continuously learn the metric behavior patterns and calculate the appropriate thresholds for unexpected behavior. You can learn more about usingdynamic thresholds for metric alerts.OperatorSelect the operator for comparing the metric value against the threshold.If you're using dynamic thresholds, alert rules can use tailored thresholds based on metric behavior for both upper and lower bounds in the same alert rule. Select one of these operators:â¢ Greater than the upper threshold or lower than the lower threshold (default)â¢ Greater than the upper thresholdâ¢ Lower than the lower thresholdAggregation typeSelect the aggregation function to apply on the data points: Sum, Count, Average, Min, or Max.Threshold valueIf you selected astaticthreshold, enter the threshold value for the condition logic.UnitIf the selected metric signal supports different units, such as bytes, KB, MB, and GB, and if you selected astaticthreshold, enter the unit for the condition logic.Threshold sensitivityIf you selected adynamicthreshold, enter the sensitivity level. The sensitivity level affects the amount of deviation from the metric series pattern that's required to trigger an alert.â¢High: Thresholds are tight and close to the metric series pattern. An alert rule is triggered on the smallest deviation, resulting in more alerts.â¢Medium: Thresholds are less tight and more balanced. There are fewer alerts than with high sensitivity (default).â¢Low: Thresholds are loose, allowing greater deviation from the metric series pattern. Alert rules are only triggered on large deviations, resulting in fewer alerts.
In theAlert logicsection:
(Optional) You can configure splitting by dimensions.Dimensions are name-value pairs that contain more data about the metric value. By using dimensions, you can filter the metrics and monitor specific time-series, instead of monitoring the aggregate of all the dimensional values.If you select more than one dimension value, each time series that results from the combination triggers its own alert and is charged separately. For example, the transactions metric of a storage account can have an API name dimension that contains the name of the API called by each transaction (for example, GetBlob, DeleteBlob, and PutPage). You can choose to have an alert fired when there's a high number of transactions in a specific API (the aggregated data). Or you can use dimensions to alert only when the number of transactions is high for specific APIs.FieldDescriptionDimension nameDimensions can be either number or string columns. Dimensions are used to monitor specific time series and provide context to a fired alert.Splitting on theAzure Resource IDcolumn makes the specified resource into the alert target. If detected, theResourceIDcolumn is selected automatically and changes the context of the fired alert to the record's resource.OperatorThe operator used on the dimension name and value.Dimension valuesThe dimension values are based on data from the last 48 hours. SelectAdd custom valueto add custom dimension values.Include all future valuesSelect this field to include any future values added to the selected dimension.

(Optional) If you're using dynamic thresholds, in theAdvanced optionssection, you can specify how many failures within a specific time period trigger an alert. For example, you can specify that you only want to trigger an alert if there were three failures in the last hour. Your application business policy should determine this setting.Select values for these fields:FieldDescriptionNumber of violationsThe number of violations within the configured time frame that trigger the alert.Evaluation periodThe time period in which the number of violations occurs.Ignore data beforeUse this setting to select the date from which to start using the metric historical data for calculating the dynamic thresholds. For example, if a resource was running in testing mode and is moved to production, you may want to disregard the metric behavior while the resource was in testing.

(Optional) In theAdvanced optionssection, you can set several options.FieldDescriptionEnable upon creationSelect for the alert rule to start running as soon as you're done creating it.Automatically resolve alertsSelect to make the alert stateful. When an alert is stateful, the alert is resolved when the condition is no longer met.If you don't select this checkbox, metric alerts are stateless. Stateless alerts fire each time the condition is met, even if alert already fired.The frequency of notifications for stateless metric alerts differs based on the alert rule's configured frequency:Alert frequency of less than 5 minutes: While the condition continues to be met, a notification is sent somewhere between one and six minutes.Alert frequency of more than 5 minutes: While the condition continues to be met, a notification is sent between the configured frequency and doubles the value of the frequency. For example, for an alert rule with a frequency of 15 minutes, a notification is sent somewhere between 15 to 30 minutes.
(Optional) In theAdvanced optionssection, you can set several options.
(Optional) In theCustom propertiessection, if this alert rule contains action groups, you can add your own properties to include in the alert notification payload. You can use these properties in the actions that the action group calls, such as by a webhook, Azure function, or logic app action.The custom properties are specified as key/value pairs by using static text, a dynamic value extracted from the alert payload, or a combination of both.The format for extracting a dynamic value from the alert payload is:${<path to schema field>}. For example:${data.essentials.monitorCondition}.Use the format of thecommon alert schemato specify the field in the payload, whether or not the action groups configured for the alert rule use the common schema.NoteCustom properties are added to the payload of the alert, but they don't appear in the email template or in the alert details in the Azure portal.The following examples use values inCustom propertiesto utilize data from a payload that uses the common alert schema.This example creates anAdditional Detailstag with data regarding the window start time and window end time:Name:Additional DetailsValue:Evaluation windowStartTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowStartTime}. windowEndTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowEndTime}Result:AdditionalDetails:Evaluation windowStartTime: 2023-04-04T14:39:24.492Z. windowEndTime: 2023-04-04T14:44:24.492ZThis example adds data regarding the reason for resolving or firing the alert:Name:Alert ${data.essentials.monitorCondition} reasonValue:${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricName} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].operator} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].threshold} ${data.essentials.monitorCondition}.

Naming restrictions for metric alert rules
Consider the following restrictions for metric alert rule names:
Metric alert rule names can't be changed (renamed) after they're created.
Metric alert rule names must be unique within a resource group.
Metric alert rule names can't contain the following characters: * # & + : < > ? @ % { } \ /
Metric alert rule names can't end with a space or a period.
The combined resource group name and alert rule name can't exceed 252 characters.
Note
If the alert rule name contains characters that aren't alphabetic or numeric, these characters might be URL-encoded when retrieved by certain clients. Examples include spaces, punctuation marks, and symbols.
Restrictions when you use dimensions in a metric alert rule with multiple conditions
Metric alerts support alerting on multi-dimensional metrics and support defining multiple conditions, up to five conditions per alert rule.
Consider the following constraints when you use dimensions in an alert rule that contains multiple conditions:
You can only select one value per dimension within each condition.
You can only select one value per dimension within each condition.
You can't use the option toSelect all current and future values. Select the asterisk (*).
You can't use the option toSelect all current and future values. Select the asterisk (*).
You can't use dynamic thresholds in alert rules that monitor multiple conditions.
You can't use dynamic thresholds in alert rules that monitor multiple conditions.
When metrics that are configured in different conditions support the same dimension, a configured dimension value must be explicitly set in the same way for all those metrics in the relevant conditions.For example:Consider a metric alert rule that's defined on a storage account and monitors two conditions:TotalTransactions> 5AverageSuccessE2ELatency> 250 msYou want to update the first condition and only monitor transactions where theApiNamedimension equals"GetBlob".Because both theTransactionsandSuccessE2ELatencymetrics support anApiNamedimension, you need to update both conditions, and have them specify theApiNamedimension with a"GetBlob"value.

Considerations when creating an alert rule that contains multiple criteria
You can only select one value per dimension within each criterion.
You can't use an asterisk (*) as a dimension value.
When metrics that are configured in different criteria support the same dimension, a configured dimension value must be explicitly set in the same way for all those metrics. For a Resource Manager template example, seeCreate a metric alert with a Resource Manager template.
