This article shows you how to connect classic VNets to Resource Manager VNets to allow the resources located in the separate deployment models to communicate with each other. The steps in this article primarily use the Azure portal, but you can also create this configuration using the PowerShell by selecting the article from this list.
This article is intended for customers who already have a VNet that was created using the classic (legacy) deployment model and want to connect the classic VNet to anther VNet that was created using the latest deployment model. If you don't already have a legacy VNet, use theCreate a VNet-to-VNet connectionarticle instead.
Architecture
Connecting a classic VNet to a Resource Manager VNet is similar to connecting a VNet to an on-premises site location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE. You can create a connection between VNets that are in different subscriptions and in different regions. You can also connect VNets that already have connections to on-premises networks, as long as the gateway is dynamic or route-based. For more information about VNet-to-VNet connections, see theVNet-to-VNet FAQ.
For this configuration, you create a VPN gateway connection over an IPsec/IKE VPN tunnel between the virtual networks. Make sure that none of your VNet ranges overlap with each other, or with any of the local networks that they connect to.
The following table shows an example of how the example VNets and local sites are defined:
Prerequisites
These steps assume that both VNets have already been created. If you're using this article as an exercise and don't have VNets, there are links in the steps to help you create them.
Verify that the address ranges for the VNets don't overlap with each other, or overlap with any of the ranges for other connections that the gateways might be connected to.

Configure the Resource Manager VNet
In this section, you create the RM virtual network and the RM VPN gateway. If you already have a Resource Manager virtual network and VPN gateway, verify that the gateway is route-based.
1. Create an RM virtual network
Create a Resource Manager VNet.
For steps, seeCreate a virtual network.
Example values:
Project detailsResource Group = RMRG
Resource Group = RMRG
Instance detailsVNet name = RMVNetRegion = East US
VNet name = RMVNet
Region = East US
IP AddressesAddress space = 192.168.0.0/16Subnet name = Subnet1Address range = 192.168.1.0/24
Address space = 192.168.0.0/16
Subnet name = Subnet1
Address range = 192.168.1.0/24
2. Create an RM virtual network gateway
Next, create the virtual network gateway (VPN gateway) object for your VNet. Creating a gateway can often take 45 minutes or more, depending on the selected gateway SKU.
For steps, seeCreate a VPN gateway
Example values:
Instance detailsName = RMGatewayRegion = East USGateway type = VPNVPN type = Route-basedSKU = VpnGw2Generation = Generation2Virtual network = RMVNetGatewaySubnet address range = 192.168.255.0/27Public IP Address Type = Basic
Name = RMGateway
Region = East US
Gateway type = VPN
VPN type = Route-based
SKU = VpnGw2
Generation = Generation2
Virtual network = RMVNet
GatewaySubnet address range = 192.168.255.0/27
Public IP Address Type = Basic
Public IP addressPublic IP address = Create newPublic IP address name = RMGWpip
Public IP address = Create new
Public IP address name = RMGWpip
3. Create an RM local network gateway
In this step, you create the local network gateway. The local network gateway is an object that specifies the address range and the Public IP address endpoint associated with your classic VNet and its virtual network gateway.
For steps, seeCreate a local network gateway.
Example values
Project detailsResource Group = RMRGRegion = East US
Resource Group = RMRG
Region = East US
Name = ClassicVNetSite
Endpoint = IP address
IP address = the Gateway Public IP address of the Classic VNet. If necessary, you can use a placeholder IP address, and then go back and modify later.
Address space = 10.1.0.0/16 (address space of the Classic VNet)
Modify site and local network gateway settings
After both gateways have completed deployment, you can proceed with the next steps. The next steps require the public IP address that is assigned to each gateway.
Modify classic VNet local site settings
In this section, you modify the local network site for the classic VNet by updating the public IP address field with the address of the Resource Manager virtual network gateway.
For these steps, you need to obtain the public IP address for theResource Manager virtual network gateway. You can find the gateway IP address by going to the RM virtual network gatewayOverviewpage. Copy the IP address.
Next, go to theclassic VNet.
On the left menu, clickSite-to-site connectionsto open the Site-to-site connections page.
UnderName, click the name of the RM site you created. For example, RMVNetSite. This opens thePropertiespage for your local site.
On the Properties page, clickEdit local site.
Change theVPN gateway IP addressto the Public IP address that is assigned to the RMVNet gateway (the gateway to which you want to connect).
ClickOKto save the settings.
Modify RM VNet local network gateway settings
In this section, you modify the local network gateway settings for the Resource Manager local network gateway object by updating the public IP address field with the address of the classic virtual network gateway.
For these steps, you need to obtain the public IP address for theclassic virtual network gateway. You can find the gateway IP address by going to the classic virtual networkOverviewpage.
InAll resources, locate the local network gateway. In our example, the local network gateway isClassicVNetSite.
In the left menu, clickConfigurationand update the IP address. Close the page.
For steps, seeModify local network gateway settings.
Configure connections
This section helps you connect your classic VNet to your RM VNet. Even though it appears that you can do the classic VNet connection in the portal, it will fail. This section requires PowerShell to be installed locally on your computer, as specified in thePrerequisites.
Get classic VNet values
When you create a VNet in the Azure portal, the full values for name and site aren't visible in the portal. For example, a VNet that appears to be named 'ClassicVNet' in the Azure portal may have a much longer name in the network configuration file. The name might look something like: 'Group ClassicRG ClassicVNet'. The local network site may also have a much longer name than what appears in the portal.
In these steps, you download the network configuration file and to obtain the values used for the next sections.
Open the PowerShell console with elevated rights and sign in to your Azure account. After logging in, your account settings are downloaded so that they're available to Azure PowerShell. The following cmdlets prompts you for the sign-in credentials for your Azure Account for theResource Manager deployment model:

Set the shared key and create the connection from the classic VNet to the Resource Manager VNet. The connections must be created using PowerShell, not the Azure portal.
If you get an error, verify the site and the VNet names are correct. Also, make sure that you've authenticated for both versions of PowerShell or you won't be able to set the shared key.
In this example,-VNetNameis the name of the classic VNet as found in your network configuration file.
The-LocalNetworkSiteNameis the name you specified for the local site, as found in your network configuration file. Use the entire site name, including any numbers.
The-SharedKeyis a value that you generate and specify. For this example, we usedabc123, but you should generate and use something more complex. The value you specify here must be the same value that you specify when creating your Resource Manager to classic connection.
Set the key.Set-AzureVNetGatewayKey -VNetName "Group ClassicRG ClassicVNet" `

Verify your connections
You can verify your connections by using the Azure portal or PowerShell. When verifying, you might need to wait a minute or two as the connection is being created. When a connection is successful, the connectivity state changes from 'Connecting' to 'Connected'.
Verify the classic VNet to RM connection
In the Azure portal, you can view the connection status for a classic VNet VPN Gateway by navigating to the connection. The following steps show one way to navigate to your connection and verify.
In theAzure portal, go to your classic virtual network (VNet).
On the virtual network page, click the type of connection you want to view. For example,Site-to-site connections.
On theSite-to-site connectionspage, underName, select the site connection you want to view.
On thePropertiespage, view the information about the connection.
Verify the RM VNet to classic connection
In the Azure portal, you can view the connection status of a VPN gateway by going to the connection. The following steps show one way to navigate to your connection and verify.
In theAzure portal, go to your virtual network gateway.
On the page for your virtual network gateway, clickConnections. You can see the status of each connection.
Click the name of the connection that you want to verify. InEssentials, you can view more information about your connection. TheStatusvalues are 'Succeeded' and 'Connected' when you have made a successful connection.
