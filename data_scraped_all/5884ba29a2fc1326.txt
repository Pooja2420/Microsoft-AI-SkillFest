The following scenarios unify technical and nontechnical considerations that your organization can use to accelerate its overall cloud adoption journey.
If you have a complex cloud adoption, you can follow trusted scenarios to narrow your focus to your requirements, which helps maximize your cloud investment. The scenarios include pointed guidance across several areas of cloud adoption best practices from the holistic and modular guidance of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. This article also references workload-specific architectural guidance from the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which contains reference architectures and example scenarios with deployment templates to help you implement solutions. These solutions are based on extensive customer experiences that represent an infrastructure that your organization can rely on.
Learn and benefit from a repository of successful cloud adoption experiences and best practices. This guidance includes collected and codified successful migration and modernization experiences across Microsoft customer communities and partner communities. Incorporate best practices that suit your cloud adoption.
