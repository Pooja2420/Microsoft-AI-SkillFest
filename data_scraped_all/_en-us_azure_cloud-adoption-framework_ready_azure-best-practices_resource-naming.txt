A good name for a resource helps you to quickly identify its type, its associated workload, its environment, and the Azure region where it runs. To do so, names should follow a consistent formatâanaming conventionâthat is composed of important information about each resource. The information in the names ideally includes whatever you need to identify specific instances of resources. For example, a public IP address (PIP) for a production SharePoint workload in the West US region might bepip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001.
pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001

Note
Consider that not all Azure resources can follow the same patterns. Make sure you understand the limitations of the resource types you are working with.
To learn more, seeNaming rules and restrictions for Azure resources.
Recommended naming components
When you construct your naming convention, identify the key pieces of information that you want to capture in a resource name. Different information is relevant for different resource types, and not all established naming components can be used for each resource type. Establish a standard naming convention for your environment that is easy to follow, concise, and useful for recognizing information that's relevant to the deployed resource.
The following list provides examples of naming components that are useful when you construct resource names:
contoso
fin
mktg
product
it
corp
rg
vm
navigator
emissions
sharepoint
hadoop
prod
dev
qa
stage
test
westus
eastus2
westeu
usva
ustx

Naming considerations
In addition to defining the naming components, you must also consider the order in which the naming components are listed and what type of delimiters (if any) should appear between components. Also take into account the different naming rules that are associated with resources types.
Scope
All Azure resource types have a scope that defines the level of that resource. Also, a resource must have a unique name within its scope.
Scope levels for Azure resource names:
Global: Unique across all of Azure.Example: Name of PaaS resources with public IP endpoints across all of Azure, because that name is the initial default public DNS name.
Global: Unique across all of Azure.
Example: Name of PaaS resources with public IP endpoints across all of Azure, because that name is the initial default public DNS name.
Resource group: Unique within the resource group.Example: All virtual networks in a resource group must have a unique name for routing within that resource group.
Resource group: Unique within the resource group.
Example: All virtual networks in a resource group must have a unique name for routing within that resource group.
Resource: Unique within the parent resource.Example: All subnets within a virtual network must have unique names to avoid segment overlap.
Resource: Unique within the parent resource.
Example: All subnets within a virtual network must have unique names to avoid segment overlap.

Diagram 2: Scope levels for Azure resource names.
For example, a virtual network has the scope of a resource group, which means that there can be only one network namedvnet-prod-westus-001in a specific resource group. Other resource groups can also have virtual networks namedvnet-prod-westus-001, but each resource group can have only one with that name. Subnets are scoped to virtual networks, so each subnet within a virtual network must have a distinct name.
vnet-prod-westus-001
vnet-prod-westus-001
Some resource names have a global scope, such as a name for a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that has a public endpoint or a virtual machine DNS label. A resource in a global scope must have a name that's unique across the entire Azure platform.
Azure naming rules
Azure naming rules vary depending on the resource type. It's important to understand naming rules for each resource type to avoid confusion and delays.
For example, resource names for different resource types might have different length limits. We recommend that you keep the length of naming components short or abbreviating names to prevent exceeding resource name length limits.
When you construct your naming convention, identify the key pieces of information that you want to reflect in a resource name. Different information is relevant for different resource types.
Recommendations:
Understand naming rules and restrictions: Balancing the context of a name with its scope and length limit is important when developing your naming conventions. For more information, seeNaming rules and restrictions for Azure resources.
Use recommended resource abbreviations: Abbreviations can help you keep resource names within length limits and make them easier to read. For more information, seeRecommended abbreviations for Azure resource types.
Consider naming consistency for VMs: If you're working with VMs in Azure, we recommend keeping names consistent even though VM names in Azure can be longer than the allowed NetBIOS name of the VM. For more information and for other restrictions, seeNaming conventions in Active Directory for computers, domains, sites, and OUs - Computer names.
Use the Azure Naming Tool: The Azure Naming Tool is a tool that helps you generate names for Azure resources based on a naming convention. For more information, seeAzure Naming Tool.
Example names
Consider these examples when you define your naming convention. The examples are based on the naming components and considerations that are described in this article.
The following examples are intended to provide visualization of a naming convention, but actual conventions vary by organization. For more examples, see theAzure Naming Tool.

Next step
A good next step is to look at recommended abbreviations for Azure resources. Abbreviations can help you keep resource names within length limits and make them easier to read.
