Azure Firewall can be configured during deployment to span multiple Availability Zones for increased availability.
This feature enables the following scenarios:
You can increase availability to 99.99% uptime. For more information, see the Azure FirewallService Level Agreement (SLA). The 99.99% uptime SLA is offered when two or more Availability Zones are selected.
You can also associate Azure Firewall to a specific zone just for proximity reasons, using the service standard 99.95% SLA.
For more information about Azure Firewall Availability Zones, seeAzure Firewall Standard features.
The following Azure PowerShell example shows how you can deploy an Azure Firewall with Availability Zones.
Create a firewall with Availability Zones
This example creates a firewall in zones 1, 2, and 3.
When the standard public IP address is created, no specific zone is specified. This creates a zone-redundant IP address by default. Standard public IP addresses can be configured either in all zones, or a single zone.
It's important to know, because you can't have a firewall in zone 1 and an IP address in zone 2. But you can have a firewall in zone 1 and IP address in all zones, or a firewall and an IP address in the same single zone for proximity purposes.
$rgName = "Test-FW-RG"

  -ResourceGroupName "Test-FW-RG" `

  -Zone 1,2,3
