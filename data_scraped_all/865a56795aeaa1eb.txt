APPLIES TO:NoSQLMongoDB
Azure Cosmos DB's point-in-time restore feature helps you to recover from an accidental change within a container, restore a deleted resource, or restore into any region where backups existed. The continuous backup mode allows you to restore to any point of time within the last 30 or 7 days. How far back you can go in time depends on the tier of the continuous mode for the account.
This article explains how to provision an account with continuous backup and point in time restore usingAzure portal,PowerShell,CLIandResource Manager templates.
Note
You can provision continuous backup mode account only if the following conditions are true:
If the account is of type API for NoSQL or MongoDB.
If the account is of type API for Table or Gremlin.
If the account has a single write region.
Provision using Azure portal
When creating a new Azure Cosmos DB account, in theBackup policytab, choosecontinuousmode to enable the point in time restore functionality for the new account. With the point-in-time restore, data is restored to a new account, currently you can't restore to an existing account.

Provision using Azure PowerShell
For PowerShell and CLI commands, the tier value is optional, if it isn't already provided. If not provided the account backup will be retained for 30 days. The tiers are represented by the valuesContinuous7DaysorContinuous30Days.
Continuous7Days
Continuous30Days
Install the latest version of Azure PowerShellBefore provisioning the account, install any version of Azure PowerShell higher than 6.2.0. For more information about the latest version of Azure PowerShell, seelatest version of Azure PowerShell.For provisioning theContinuous7Daystier, you'll need to install the preview version of the module by runningInstall-Module -Name Az.CosmosDB -AllowPrerelease.

API for NoSQL account
To provision an account with continuous backup, add the argument-BackupPolicyType Continuousalong with the regular provisioning command.
-BackupPolicyType Continuous
The following cmdlet assumes a single region write account,Pitracct, in the inWest USregion in theMyRGresource group. The account has continuous backup policy enabled. Continuous backup is configured at theContinuous7daystier:
Continuous7days
New-AzCosmosDBAccount `
  -ResourceGroupName "MyRG" `
  -Location "West US" `
  -BackupPolicyType Continuous `
  -ContinuousTier Continuous7Days `
  -Name "pitracct" `
  -ApiKind "Sql"
New-AzCosmosDBAccount `
  -ResourceGroupName "MyRG" `
  -Location "West US" `
  -BackupPolicyType Continuous `
  -ContinuousTier Continuous7Days `
  -Name "pitracct" `
  -ApiKind "Sql"
API for MongoDB
The following cmdlet is an example of continuous backup account configured with theContinuous30daystier:

-BackupPolicyType Continuous
The following cmdlet is an example of an account  with continuous backup policy configured with theContinuous30daystier:

Provision using Azure CLI
For PowerShell and CLI commands tier value is optional, if it isn't provided â the account backup will be retained for 30 days. The tiers are represented byContinuous7DaysorContinuous30Days.

Provision using Resource Manager template
You can use Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy an Azure Cosmos DB account with continuous mode. When defining the template to provision an account, include thebackupPolicyand tier parameter as shown in the following example, tier can beContinuous7DaysorContinuous30Days:
backupPolicy
Continuous7Days
Continuous30Days
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "ademo-pitr1",
      "type": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2023-04-15",
      "location": "West US",
      "properties": {
        "locations": [
          {
            "locationName": "West US"
          }
        ],
        "backupPolicy":{
        "type":"Continuous", 
        "continuousModeProperties":{
        "tier":"Continuous7Days"
        }
        } 
        "databaseAccountOfferType": "Standard"
        } }
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "ademo-pitr1",
      "type": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2023-04-15",
      "location": "West US",
      "properties": {
        "locations": [
          {
            "locationName": "West US"
          }
        ],
        "backupPolicy":{
        "type":"Continuous", 
        "continuousModeProperties":{
        "tier":"Continuous7Days"
        }
        } 
        "databaseAccountOfferType": "Standard"
        } }
Next, deploy the template by using Azure PowerShell or CLI. The following example shows how to deploy the template with a CLI command:
az deployment group create -g <ResourceGroup> --template-file <ProvisionTemplateFilePath>
az deployment group create -g <ResourceGroup> --template-file <ProvisionTemplateFilePath>
