Azure Arc offers different services based on your existing IT infrastructure and management needs. Before onboarding your resources to Azure Arc-enabled servers, you should investigate the different Azure Arc offerings to determine which best suits your requirements. Choosing the right Azure Arc service provides the best possible inventorying and management of your resources.
There are several different ways you can connect your existing Windows and Linux machines to Azure Arc:
Azure Arc-enabled servers
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere
Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
Azure Local
Each of these services extends the Azure control plane to your existing infrastructure and enables the use ofAzure security, governance, and management capabilities using the Connected Machine agent. Other services besides Azure Arc-enabled servers also use anAzure Arc resource bridge, a part of the core Azure Arc platform that provides self-servicing and additional management capabilities.
The following table provides a quick way to see the major capabilities of the Azure Arc services that connect your existing Windows and Linux machines to Azure Arc.
General recommendations
General recommendations about the right service to use are as follows:
If you're unsure about which of these services to use, you can start with Azure Arc-enabled servers and add a resource bridge for additional management capabilities later. Azure Arc-enabled servers allows you to connect servers containing all of the types of VMs supported by the other services and provides a wide range of capabilities such as Azure Policy and monitoring, while adding resource bridge can extend additional capabilities.
Region availability also varies between Azure Arc services, so you may need to use Azure Arc-enabled servers if a more specialized version of Azure Arc is unavailable in your preferred region. SeeAzure Products by Regionto learn more about region availability for Azure Arc services.
Where your machine runs determines the best Azure Arc service to use. Organizations with diverse infrastructure may end up using more than one Azure Arc service; this is alright. The core set of features remains the same no matter which Azure Arc service you use.
Azure Arc-enabled servers
Azure Arc-enabled serverslets you manage Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network, or other cloud provider. When connecting your machine to Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can perform various operational functions similar to native Azure virtual machines.

Important
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere and Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM have all the capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled servers, but also provide specific, additional capabilities.
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere
Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSpheresimplifies the management of hybrid IT resources distributed across VMware vSphere and Azure.
Running software in Azure VMware Solution, as a private cloud in Azure, offers some benefits not realized by operating your environment outside of Azure. For software running in a VM, such as SQL Server and Windows Server, running in Azure VMware Solution provides additional value such as free Extended Security Updates (ESUs).
To take advantage of these benefits if you're running in an Azure VMware Solution, it's important to follow respectiveonboardingprocesses to fully integrate the experience with the AVS private cloud.
Additionally, when a VM in Azure VMware Solution private cloud is Azure Arc-enabled using a method distinct from the one outlined in the AVS public document, the steps are provided in thedocumentto refresh the integration between the Azure Arc-enabled VMs and Azure VMware Solution.
