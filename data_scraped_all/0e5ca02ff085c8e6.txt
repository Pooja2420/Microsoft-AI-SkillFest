Audit events emitted to theMicrosoft 365 unified audit logfor central reporting are viewable in theActivity explorer, which can help you track the adoption of your labels that classify and protect your organization's data.
Audit enables you to do perform the following steps:
Aggregate data from your Azure Information Protection clients, Azure Information Protection scanners and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
View audit events in theMicrosoft 365 unified audit logand Office 365 activity log for your organization.
Query, view and detect audit events inActivity explorerwith a graphical interface in the compliance portal.
Audit events from the Microsoft 365 unified audit log
The AIP Unified Labeling client includes the Add-in for Office, the Scanner, the Viewer for Windows, the client PowerShell, and the Classify-and-Protect shell extension for Windows. All these components generate audit events that show up in the Office 365 activity logs and can be queried using theOffice 365 Management Activity API.
Audit events enable an administrator to:
Monitor labeled and protected documents and emails across your organization.
Monitor user access to labeled documents and emails, and track document classification changes.
Microsoft 365 unified audit log event schema
The five events (also called âAuditLogRecordTypeâ) specific to AIP listed below, and more details about each can be found within theAPI reference.
This information is accessible in the Microsoft 365 unified audit log for your organization and can be viewed in the Activity explorer.
Query Audit Events in Activity Explorer

The Activity explorer in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal is a graphical interface to view audit events emitted to the Microsoft 365 unified audit log. An administrator of the tenant can use built-in queries to determine whether the policies and controls implemented by your organization is effective. With up to 30 days of data available, an administrator can set filters and clearly see when and how sensitive data is handled within your organization.
To see AIP-specific activity, an administrator can begin with the following filters:
Activity type:Label appliedLabel changedLabel removedLabel file read
Label applied
Label changed
Label removed
Label file read
Application:Microsoft Azure Information Protection Word add-inMicrosoft Azure Information Protection Excel add-inMicrosoft Azure Information Protection PowerPoint add-inMicrosoft Azure Information Protection Outlook add-in
Microsoft Azure Information Protection Word add-in
Microsoft Azure Information Protection Excel add-in
Microsoft Azure Information Protection PowerPoint add-in
Microsoft Azure Information Protection Outlook add-in
An administrator might not see all the options in the filter, or may see more; the filter values depend on what activities are captured for your tenant. For more information about the Activity explorer, see:

To prevent the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client from sending auditing data, configure alabel policy advanced setting.
Azure Information Protection lets you collect and store the actual data that's identified as being a sensitive information type (predefined or custom). For example, this can include credit card numbers that are found, as well as social security numbers, passport numbers, and bank account numbers. The content matches are displayed when you select an entry fromActivity logs, and view theActivity Details.
By default, Azure Information Protection clients don't send content matches. To change this behavior so that content matches are sent, configure anadvanced settingin a label policy.
