Your on-premises Azure Local solution integrates with Azure cloud via several cloud service components, such as Azure Local cloud service, Azure Arc, and other Azure hybrid services. This article describes the functionality provided by these cloud service components, and how they help provide hybrid capabilities to your Azure Local deployment.

Azure Local cloud service
The Azure Local cloud service in Azure is a key part of the Azure Local product offering. It includes standard Azure components, such as a resource provider in Azure Resource Manager and a UI extension in the Azure portal. These components enable access to Azure Local functionality via familiar Azure tools and UX, such asAzure portal,Azure PowerShell, andAzure CLI. The Azure Local cloud service also enables contextual navigation from an Azure Local resource to its Arc-enabled servers and Azure Local virtual machines (VMs) enabled by Azure Arc.
The Azure Local cloud service extends the hybrid capabilities for Azure Local by enabling the following cloud-based functionalities:
Registration.To enable hybrid capabilities, you must register every Azure Local that you intend to connect with Azure Arc. For more information, seeRegister your machines and assign permissions for Azure Local deployment.

Deployment and security.Azure Local supports cloud-based deployment through the Azure portal or an Azure Resource Manager deployment template. For more information, seeDeploy Azure Local using the Azure portalandDeploy Azure Local via the Azure Resource Manager deployment template.The Azure Local deployment follows a secure-by-default strategy, including a tailored security baseline, a security drift control mechanism, and default security features. Post-deployment, you can view the security settings for Azure Local via the Azure portal. For more information, seeAbout security features.

Monitoring.You can perform basic monitoring of all Azure Local resources and confirm the deployment via the Azure portal. For more information, seeVerify a successful deployment. Advanced monitoring utilizes Azure Monitor tools, such as Insights, Metrics, Logs, Workbooks, and Alerts. For information about monitoring Azure Local, seeWhat is Azure Local monitoring?.

Observability and support.Azure Local observability feature collects telemetry and diagnostic data, which helps Microsoft in system analysis and issue resolution. Observability and remote support are integral to the Azure Local deployment process. For more information, seeAzure Local observabilityandGet remote support for Azure Local.

Licensing.An Azure Local requires cloud connectivity to keep its license up to date. The Azure Local cloud service validates proper registrations and distributes new licenses. To learn more about how licensing impacts functionality, seeAzure Local FAQ - What happens if the 30-day limit is exceeded?Azure verification for VMs makes it possible for supported Azure-exclusive workloads to work outside of the cloud. This feature is a built-in platform attestation service that is enabled by default on Azure Local. For more information, seeAzure verification for VMs.

Diagnostics.Azure Local diagnostic data helps Microsoft detect, diagnose, and fix problems to restore service health and improve products. To collect diagnostic data for a registered and connected system, seeCollect diagnostic logs for Azure Local. To collect diagnostics data in scenarios where observability components aren't deployed or during issues with the system registration process, seePerform standalone log collection.

Enhanced management.You can perform enhanced management of your Azure Local from Azure. This feature is enabled by the Managed Identity created for your Azure Local resource that serves as the identity for the various components of your system. For more information, seeEnhanced management of Azure Local from Azure.

Azure Arc on Azure Local
Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent management plane from Azure. To learn more about Azure Arc, seeAzure Arc overview. For additional guidance regarding the different services Azure Arc offers, seeChoosing the right Azure Arc service for machines.
Azure Local delivers hybrid value through the following Azure Arc technologies:
Arc-enabled servers.As part of the Azure Local deployment process, you must register every Azure Local that you intend to join with Azure Arc. For more information, seeRegister your machines and assign permissions for Azure Local deployment.You can install, upgrade, and manage Azure Arc extensions on Azure Local to run hybrid services like monitoring and Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal. For more information, seeAzure Arc extension management on Azure Local.
