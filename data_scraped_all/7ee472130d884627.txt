Document Intelligence Studiois an online tool for visually exploring, understanding, and integrating features from the Document Intelligence service in your applications. This quickstart aims to give you a guide of setting up a custom project in Document Intelligence Studio.
Prerequisites for new users
For details on subscription, resource, and authentication setup,seeGet started with Document Intelligence Studio.
Additional prerequisites for custom projects
In addition to the Azure account and a Document Intelligence or Azure AI services resource, you need:
Azure Blob Storage container
Astandard performanceAzure Blob Storage account. You create containers to store and organize your training documents within your storage account. If you don't know how to create an Azure storage account with a container, following these quickstarts:
Create a storage account. When creating your storage account, make sure to selectStandardperformance in theInstance details â Performancefield.
Create a container. When creating your container, set thePublic access levelfield toContainer(anonymous read access for containers and blobs) in theNew Containerwindow.
Azure role assignments
For custom projects, the following role assignments are required for different scenarios.
BasicCognitive Services User: You need this role for Document Intelligence or Azure AI services resource to train the custom model or do analysis with trained models.Storage Blob Data Contributor: You need this role for the Storage Account to create a project and label data.
Basic

Storage Blob Data Contributor: You need this role for the Storage Account to create a project and label data.
AdvancedStorage Account Contributor: You need this role for the Storage Account to set up CORS settings (this action is a one-time effort if the same storage account is reused).Contributor: You need this role to create a resource group and resources.NoteIf local (key-based) authentication is disabled for your Document Intelligence service resource and storage account, be sure to obtainCognitive Services UserandStorage Blob Data Contributorroles respectively, so you have enough permissions to use Document Intelligence Studio. TheStorage Account ContributorandContributorroles only allow you to list keys but don't give you permission to use the resources when key-access is disabled.

Configure CORS
CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)needs to be configured on your Azure storage account for it to be accessible from the Document Intelligence Studio. To configure CORS in the Azure portal, you need access to the CORS tab of your storage account.
Select the CORS tab for the storage account.
Select the CORS tab for the storage account.

Start by creating a new CORS entry in the Blob service.

Set theAllowed originstohttps://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com.TipYou can use the wildcard character '*' rather than a specified domain to allow all origin domains to make requests via CORS.
Set theAllowed originstohttps://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com.

Tip
You can use the wildcard character '*' rather than a specified domain to allow all origin domains to make requests via CORS.
Select all the available 8 options forAllowed methods.

Note
By default, the Studio uses documents that are located at the root of your container. However, you can use data organized in folders by specifying the folder path in the Custom form project creation steps.SeeOrganize your data in subfolders
Use Document Intelligence Studio features
Auto label documents with prebuilt models or one of your own models
In custom extraction model labeling page, you can now auto label your documents using one of Document Intelligent Service prebuilt models or your trained models.
In custom extraction model labeling page, you can now auto label your documents using one of Document Intelligent Service prebuilt models or your trained models.

For some documents, duplicate labels after running autolabel are possible. Make sure to modify the labels so that there are no duplicate labels in the labeling page afterwards.

Auto label tables
In custom extraction model labeling page, you can now auto label the tables in the document without having to label the tables manually.

Add test files directly to your training dataset
Once you train a custom extraction model, make use of the test page to improve your model quality by uploading test documents to training dataset if needed.

If a low confidence score is returned for some labels, make sure to correctly label your content. If not, add them to the training dataset and relabel to improve the model quality.

Make use of the document list options and filters in custom projects
Use the custom extraction model labeling page to navigate through your training documents with ease by making use of the search, filter, and sort by feature.
