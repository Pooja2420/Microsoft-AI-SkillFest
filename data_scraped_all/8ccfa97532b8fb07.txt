Applies to:Azure SQL Database
Query Performance Insight provides intelligent query analysis for single and pooled databases. It helps identify the top resource consuming and long-running queries in your workload. This helps you find the queries to optimize to improve overall workload performance and efficiently use the resource that you are paying for. Query Performance Insight helps you spend less time troubleshooting database performance by providing:
Deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption
Details on top database queries by CPU, duration, and execution count (potential tuning candidates for performance improvements)
The ability to drill down into details of a query, to view the query text and history of resource utilization
Annotations that show performance recommendations fromdatabase advisors

Prerequisites
Query Performance Insight requires thatQuery Storeis active on your database. It's automatically enabled for all databases in Azure SQL Database by default. If Query Store is not running, the Azure portal will prompt you to enable it.
Note
If the "Query Store is not properly configured on this database" message appears in the portal, seeOptimizing the Query Store configuration.
Permissions
You need the followingAzure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)permissions to use Query Performance Insight:
Reader,Owner,Contributor,SQL DB Contributor, orSQL Server Contributorpermissions are required to view the top resource-consuming queries and charts.
Owner,Contributor,SQL DB Contributor, orSQL Server Contributorpermissions are required to view query text.

Note
For Azure SQL Database to render the information in Query Performance Insight, Query Store needs to capture a couple hours of data. If the database has no activity or if Query Store was not active during a certain period, the charts will be empty when Query Performance Insight displays that time range. You can enable Query Store at any time if it's not running. For more information, seeBest practices with Query Store.
For database performance recommendations, selectRecommendationson the Query Performance Insight navigation pane.

Review top CPU-consuming queries
By default, Query Performance Insight shows the top five CPU-consuming queries when you first open it.
Select or clear individual queries to include or exclude them from the chart by using check boxes.The top line shows overall DTU percentage for the database. The bars show CPU percentage that the selected queries consumed during the selected interval. For example, ifPast weekis selected, each bar represents a single day.ImportantThe DTU line shown is aggregated to a maximum consumption value in one-hour periods. It's meant for a high-level comparison only with query execution statistics. In some cases, DTU utilization might seem too high compared to executed queries, but this might not be the case.For example, if a query maxed out DTU to 100% for a few minutes only, the DTU line in Query Performance Insight will show the entire hour of consumption as 100% (the consequence of the maximum aggregated value).For a finer comparison (up to one minute), consider creating a custom DTU utilization chart:In the Azure portal, selectAzure SQL Database>Monitoring.SelectMetrics.Select+Add chart.Select the DTU percentage on the chart.In addition, selectLast 24 hourson the upper-left menu and change it to one minute.Use the custom DTU chart with a finer level of details to compare with the query execution chart.The bottom grid shows aggregated information for the visible queries:Query ID, which is a unique identifier for the query in the database.CPU per query during an observable interval, which depends on the aggregation function.Duration per query, which also depends on the aggregation function.Total number of executions for a specific query.

The top line shows overall DTU percentage for the database. The bars show CPU percentage that the selected queries consumed during the selected interval. For example, ifPast weekis selected, each bar represents a single day.

Important
The DTU line shown is aggregated to a maximum consumption value in one-hour periods. It's meant for a high-level comparison only with query execution statistics. In some cases, DTU utilization might seem too high compared to executed queries, but this might not be the case.
For example, if a query maxed out DTU to 100% for a few minutes only, the DTU line in Query Performance Insight will show the entire hour of consumption as 100% (the consequence of the maximum aggregated value).
For a finer comparison (up to one minute), consider creating a custom DTU utilization chart:
In the Azure portal, selectAzure SQL Database>Monitoring.
SelectMetrics.
Select+Add chart.
Select the DTU percentage on the chart.
In addition, selectLast 24 hourson the upper-left menu and change it to one minute.
Use the custom DTU chart with a finer level of details to compare with the query execution chart.
The bottom grid shows aggregated information for the visible queries:
Query ID, which is a unique identifier for the query in the database.
CPU per query during an observable interval, which depends on the aggregation function.
Duration per query, which also depends on the aggregation function.
Total number of executions for a specific query.

Your database can run many more queries beyond the top ones shown, and these queries will not be included on the chart.There might exist a database workload type in which lots of smaller queries, beyond the top ones shown, run frequently and use the majority of DTU. These queries don't appear on the performance chart.For example, a query might have consumed a substantial amount of DTU for a while, although its total consumption in the observed period is less than the other top-consuming queries. In such a case, resource utilization of this query would not appear on the chart.If you need to understand top query executions beyond the limitations of Query Performance Insight, consider usingdatabase watcherfor advanced database performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

Review top queries per duration
Two metrics in Query Performance Insight can help you find potential bottlenecks: duration and execution count.
Long-running queries have the greatest potential for locking resources longer, blocking other users, and limiting scalability. They're also the best candidates for optimization. For more information, seeUnderstand and resolve Azure SQL blocking problems.
To identify long-running queries:
Open theCustomtab in Query Performance Insight for the selected database.

Review top queries per execution count
A user application that uses the database might get slow, even though a high number of executions might not be affecting the database itself and resources usage is low.
In some cases, a high execution count can lead to more network round trips. Round trips affect performance. They're subject to network latency and to downstream server latency.
For example, many data-driven websites heavily access the database for every user request. Although connection pooling helps, the increased network traffic and processing load on the server can slow performance. In general, keep round trips to a minimum.
To identify frequently executed ("chatty") queries:
Open theCustomtab in Query Performance Insight for the selected database.

Understand performance tuning annotations
While exploring your workload in Query Performance Insight, you might notice icons with a vertical line on top of the chart.
These icons are annotations. They show performance recommendations fromAzure SQL Database Advisor. By hovering over an annotation, you can get summarized information on performance recommendations.

If you want to understand more or apply the advisor's recommendation, select the icon to open details of the recommended action. If this is an active recommendation, you can apply it right away from the portal.

In some cases, due to the zoom level, it's possible that annotations close to each other are collapsed into a single annotation. Query Performance Insight represents this as a group annotation icon. Selecting the group annotation icon opens a new pane that lists the annotations.
Correlating queries and performance-tuning actions might help you to better understand your workload.
Optimize the Query Store configuration
While using Query Performance Insight, you might see the following Query Store error messages:
"Query Store is not properly configured on this database. Select here to learn more."
"Query Store is not properly configured on this database. Select here to change settings."
These messages usually appear when Query Store can't collect new data.
The first case happens when Query Store is in the read-only state and parameters are set optimally. You can fix this by increasing the size of the data store, or by clearing Query Store. (If you clear Query Store, all previously collected telemetry will be lost.)

The second case happens when Query Store is not enabled, or parameters are not set optimally. You can change the retention and capture policy, and also enable Query Store, by running the following T-SQL commands providedthe Azure portal query editor,SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS),Azure Data Studio,sqlcmd, or the client tool of your choice.
Recommended retention and capture policy
There are two types of retention policies:
Size based: If this policy is set toAUTO, it will clean data automatically when near maximum size is reached.
Time based: By default, this policy is set to 30 days. If Query Store runs out of space, it will delete query information older than 30 days.
You can set the capture policy to:
All: Query Store captures all queries.
Auto: Query Store ignores infrequent queries and queries with insignificant compile and execution duration. Thresholds for execution count, compile duration, and runtime duration are internally determined. This is the default option.
None: Query Store stops capturing new queries, but runtime statistics for already captured queries are still collected.
We recommend setting all policies toAUTOand the cleaning policy to 30 days by executing the following commands fromSSMSor the Azure portal. (ReplaceYourDBwith the database name.)
YourDB
ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (SIZE_BASED_CLEANUP_MODE = AUTO);

    ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (CLEANUP_POLICY = (STALE_QUERY_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 30));

    ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = AUTO);
ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (SIZE_BASED_CLEANUP_MODE = AUTO);

    ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (CLEANUP_POLICY = (STALE_QUERY_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 30));

    ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = AUTO);
Increase the size of Query Store by connecting to a database throughSSMSor the Azure portal and running the following query. (ReplaceYourDBwith the database name.)
YourDB
ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (MAX_STORAGE_SIZE_MB = 1024);
ALTER DATABASE [YourDB]
    SET QUERY_STORE (MAX_STORAGE_SIZE_MB = 1024);
Applying these settings will eventually make Query Store collect telemetry for new queries. If you need Query Store to be operational right away, you can optionally choose to clear Query Store by running the following query through SSMS or the Azure portal. (ReplaceYourDBwith the database name.)
YourDB
Note
Running the following query will delete all previously collected monitored telemetry in Query Store.
ALTER DATABASE [YourDB] SET QUERY_STORE CLEAR;
ALTER DATABASE [YourDB] SET QUERY_STORE CLEAR;
