This guide teaches youto migrateyour Oracle schemas to Azure SQL Database by using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle.
For other migration guides, seeAzure Database Migration Guides.
For detailed code assessment and conversion, continue with SSMA for Oracle.
Prerequisites
Before you begin migrating your Oracle schema to SQL Database:
Verify that your source environment is supported.

Pre-migration
After you meet the prerequisites, you're ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of yourAzure cloud migration. This part of the process involves conducting an inventory of the databases that you need to migrate, assessing those databases for potential migration issues or blockers, and then resolving any items you might have uncovered.
Assess
By using SSMA for Oracle, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Database, and then finally migrate data to the database.
To create an assessment:
OpenSSMA for Oracle.

Review the HTML report to understand conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Oracle objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects.For example, seedrive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyOracleMigration\report\report_2020_11_12T02_47_55\.

Validate the data types
Validate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements if necessary. To do so, follow these steps:
In SSMA for Oracle, selectTools, and then selectProject Settings.

To convert the schema:
(Optional) Add dynamic or ad hoc queries to statements. Right-click the node, and then selectAdd statements.

Save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. On theFilemenu, selectSave Project. This step gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you publish the schema to SQL Database.

Migrate
After you assess your databases and address any discrepancies, the next step is to run the migration process. Migration involves two steps: publishing the schema and migrating the data.
To publish your schema and migrate your data:
Publish the schema by right-clicking the database from theDatabasesnode inAzure SQL Database Metadata Explorerand selectingSynchronize with Database.

Migrate the data by right-clicking the database or object you want to migrate inOracle Metadata Explorerand selectingMigrate Data. Or, you can select theMigrate Datatab. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expandTables, and then select the checkboxes next to the tables. To omit data from individual tables, clear the checkboxes.

Post-migration
After you successfully complete themigrationstage, you need to complete a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
Remediate applications
After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this task requires changes to the applications in some cases.
Perform tests
The test approach to database migration consists of the following activities:
Develop validation tests: To test the database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you define.

Set up a test environment: The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

Optimize
The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues, verifying completeness, and addressing performance issues with the workload.
For more information about these issues and the steps to mitigate them, see thePost-migration validation and optimization guide.
