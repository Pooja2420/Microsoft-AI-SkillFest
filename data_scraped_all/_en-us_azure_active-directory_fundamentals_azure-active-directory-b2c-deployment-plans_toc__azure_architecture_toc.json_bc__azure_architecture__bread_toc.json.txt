Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is an identity and access management solution that can ease integration with your infrastructure. Use the following guidance to help understand requirements and compliance throughout an Azure AD B2C deployment.
Plan an Azure AD B2C deployment
Requirements
Assess the primary reason to turn off systemsSee,What is Azure Active Directory B2C?
See,What is Azure Active Directory B2C?
For a new application, plan the design of the Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) systemSee,Planning and design

If you use Kerberos, Microsoft Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM), and Web Services Federation (WS-Fed), see the video,Application and identity migration to Azure AD B2C
After migration, your applications can support modern identity protocols such as Open Authorization (OAuth) 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
Stakeholders
Technology project success depends on managing expectations, outcomes, and responsibilities.
Identify the application architect, technical program manager, and owner
Create a distribution list (DL) to communicate with the Microsoft account or engineering teamsAsk questions, get answers, and receive notifications
Ask questions, get answers, and receive notifications
Identify a partner or resource outside your organization to support you

Communications
Communicate proactively and regularly with your users about pending and current changes. Inform them about how the experience changes, when it changes, and provide a contact for support.
Timelines
Help set realistic expectations and make contingency plans to meet key milestones:
Pilot date
Launch date
Dates that affect delivery
Dependencies
Implement an Azure AD B2C deployment
Deploy applications and user identities- Deploy client application and migrate user identities
Client application onboarding and deliverables- Onboard the client application and test the solution
Security- Enhance the identity solution security
Compliance- Address regulatory requirements
User experience- Enable a user-friendly service
Deploy authentication and authorization
Before your applications interact with Azure AD B2C, register them in a tenant you manageSee,Tutorial: Create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant
See,Tutorial: Create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant
For authorization, use the Identity Experience Framework (IEF) sample user journeysSee,Azure Active Directory B2C: Custom CIAM User Journeys

Checklist for personas, permissions, delegation, and calls
Identify the personas that access to your application
Define how you manage system permissions and entitlements today, and in the future
Confirm you have a permission store and if there are permissions to add to the directory
Define how you manage delegated administrationFor example, your customers' customers management
For example, your customers' customers management
Verify your application calls an API Manager (APIM)There might be a need to call from the IdP before the application is issued a token
There might be a need to call from the IdP before the application is issued a token
Deploy applications and user identities
Azure AD B2C projects start with one or more client applications.

Application deployment checklist
Applications included in the CIAM deployment
Applications in useFor example, web applications, APIs, single-page web apps (SPAs), or native mobile applications
For example, web applications, APIs, single-page web apps (SPAs), or native mobile applications
Authentication in use:For example, forms federated with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), or federated with OIDCIf OIDC, confirm the response type: code or id_token
For example, forms federated with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), or federated with OIDC
If OIDC, confirm the response type: code or id_token
Determine where front-end and back-end applications are hosted: on-premises, cloud, or hybrid-cloud
Confirm the platforms or languages in use:For example ASP.NET, Java, and Node.jsSee,Quickstart: Set up sign in for an ASP.NET application using Azure AD B2C
For example ASP.NET, Java, and Node.js
See,Quickstart: Set up sign in for an ASP.NET application using Azure AD B2C
Verify where user attributes are storedFor example, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or databases
For example, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or databases
User identity deployment checklist
Confirm the number of users accessing applications
Determine the IdP types needed:For example, Facebook, local account, and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)See,Active Directory Federation Services
For example, Facebook, local account, and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
See,Active Directory Federation Services
Outline the claim schema required from your application, Azure AD B2C, and IdPs if applicableSee,ClaimsSchema
See,ClaimsSchema

Client application onboarding and deliverables
Use the following checklist for onboarding an application
Use the following checklist for delivery.
Security
Use the following checklist to enhance application security.
Authentication method, such as multifactor authentication:Multifactor authentication is recommended for users that trigger high-value transactions or other risk events. For example, banking, finance, and check-out processes.See,What authentication and verification methods are available in Microsoft Entra ID?

Confirm use of anti-bot mechanisms
Assess the risk of attempts to create a fraudulent account or sign-inSee,Tutorial: Configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection with Azure Active Directory B2C
See,Tutorial: Configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection with Azure Active Directory B2C
Confirm needed conditional postures as part of sign-in or sign-up
The modern security perimeter now extends beyond an organization's network. The perimeter includes user and device identity.See,What is Conditional Access?

Compliance
To help comply with regulatory requirements and enhance back-end system security you can use virtual networks (VNets), IP restrictions, Web Application Firewall, and so on. Consider the following requirements:
Your regulatory compliance requirementsFor example, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)Go to pcisecuritystandards.org to learn more about thePCI Security Standards Council

Use screenshots and user stories to show the application end-user experienceFor example, screenshots of sign-in, sign-up, sign-up/sign-in (SUSI), profile edit, and password reset
For example, screenshots of sign-in, sign-up, sign-up/sign-in (SUSI), profile edit, and password reset
Look for hints passed through by using query string parameters in your CIAM solution
For high user experience customization, consider a using front-end developer
In Azure AD B2C, you can customize HTML and CSSSee,Guidelines for using JavaScript
