This article shows you how to create a new log search alert rule or edit an existing log search alert rule in Azure Monitor. To learn more about alerts, see thealerts overview.
Alert rules combine the resources to be monitored, the monitoring data from the resource, and the conditions that you want to trigger the alert. You can then defineaction groupsandalert processing rulesto determine what happens when an alert is triggered.
Alerts triggered by these alert rules contain a payload that uses thecommon alert schema.
Prerequisites
To create or edit an alert rule, you must have the following permissions:
Read permission on the target resource of the alert rule.
Write permission on the resource group in which the alert rule is created. If you're creating the alert rule from the Azure portal, the alert rule is created by default in the same resource group in which the target resource resides.
Read permission on any action group associated to the alert rule, if applicable.
Access the alert rule wizard in the Azure portal
There are multiple ways to create or edit an alert rule.
Create or edit an alert rule from the portal home page
In theAzure portal, selectMonitor.
On the left pane, selectAlerts.
Select+ Create>Alert rule.

Create or edit an alert rule from a specific resource
In theAzure portal, go to the resource.
On the left pane, selectAlerts.
Select+ Create>Alert rule.
The scope of the alert rule is set to the resource you selected. Continue with setting the conditions for the alert rule.

Edit an existing alert rule
In theAzure portal, either from the home page or from a specific resource, selectAlertson the left pane.

On theLogspane, write a query that returns the log events for which you want to create an alert. To use one of the predefined alert rule queries, expand theSchema and filterpane next to theLogspane. Then select theQueriestab, and select one of the queries.Be aware of these limitations for log search alert rule queries:Log search alert rule queries don't supportbag_unpack(),pivot(), andnarrow().Log search alert rule queries supportago()withtimespan literalsonly.AggregatedValueis a reserved word. You can't use it in the query on log search alert rules.The combined size of all data in the properties of the log search alert rules can't exceed 64 KB.When defining custom functions in the KQL query for log search alerts, it is important to be cautious with function code that includes relative time clauses (e.g., now()). Custom functions with relative time clauses that are not defined within the log search alert KQL query itself can introduce inconsistencies in query results, potentially impacting the accuracy and reliability of alert evaluations. Therefore:To ensure accurate and timely alerting, always define relative time clauses directly within the log search alert KQL query.If time ranges are needed inside the function, they should be passed as parameters and used in the function.

(Optional) If you're querying an Azure Data Explorer or Azure Resource Graph cluster, the Log Analytics workspace can't automatically identify the column with the event time stamp. We recommend that you add a time range filter to the query. For example:adx('https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples').table
    | where MyTS >= ago(5m) and MyTS <= now()arg("").Resources
    | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines'
    | project _ResourceId=tolower(id), tagsNoteYou must use a managed identity when using Azure resource graph queries in log search alerts.Each managed identity supports a maximum of 50 log search alert rules using Azure resource graph queries.Ensure that the alerting configuration doesn't exceed this limit to maintain proper functionality.Sample log search alert queriesare available for Azure Data Explorer and Resource Graph.Cross-service queries aren't supported in government clouds.

In theMeasurementsection, select values for these fields:FieldDescriptionMeasureLog search alerts can measure two things that you can use for various monitoring scenarios:Table rows: You can use the number of returned rows to work with events such as Windows event logs, Syslog, and application exceptions.Calculation of a numeric column: You can use calculations based on any numeric column to include any number of resources. An example is CPU percentage.Aggregation typeThe calculation performed on multiple records to aggregate them to one numeric value by using the aggregation granularity. Examples areTotal,Average,Minimum, andMaximum.Aggregation granularityThe interval for aggregating multiple records to one numeric value.
In theMeasurementsection, select values for these fields:

(Optional) In theSplit by dimensionssection, you can use dimensions to help provide context for the triggered alert.Dimensions are columns from your query results that contain additional data. When you use dimensions, the alert rule groups the query results by the dimension values and evaluates the results of each group separately. If the condition is met, the rule fires an alert for that group. The alert payload includes the combination that triggered the alert.You can apply up to six dimensions per alert rule. Dimensions can be only string or numeric columns. If you want to use a column that isn't a number or string type as a dimension, you must convert it to a string or numeric value in your query. If you select more than one dimension value, each time series that results from the combination triggers its own alert and is charged separately.For example:You could use dimensions to monitor CPU usage on multiple instances that run your website or app. Each instance is monitored individually, and notifications are sent for each instance where the CPU usage exceeds the configured value.You could decide not to split by dimensions when you want a condition applied to multiple resources in the scope. For example, you wouldn't use dimensions if you want to fire an alert if at least five machines in the resource group scope have CPU usage above the configured value.In general, if your alert rule scope is a workspace, the alerts are fired on the workspace. If you want a separate alert for each affected Azure resource, you can:Use the Azure Resource ManagerAzure Resource IDcolumn as a dimension. When you use this option, the alert is fired on the workspace with theAzure Resource IDcolumn as a dimension.Specify the alert as a dimension in theAzure Resource IDproperty. This option makes the resource that your query returns the target of the alert. Alerts are then fired on the resource that your query returns, such as a virtual machine or a storage account, as opposed to the workspace.When you use this option, if the workspace gets data from resources in more than one subscription, alerts can be triggered on resources from a subscription that's different from the alert rule subscription.Select values for these fields:FieldDescriptionDimension nameDimensions can be either number or string columns. Dimensions are used to monitor specific time series and provide context to a fired alert.OperatorThe operator that's used on the dimension name and value.Dimension valuesThe dimension values are based on data from the last 48 hours. SelectAdd custom valueto add custom dimension values.Include all future valuesSelect this field to include any future values added to the selected dimension.

Select values for these fields:

In theAlert logicsection, select values for these fields:FieldDescriptionOperatorThe query results are transformed into a number. In this field, select the operator to use for comparing the number against the threshold.Threshold valueA number value for the threshold.Frequency of evaluationHow often the query is run. You can set it anywhere from one minute to one day (24 hours).NoteThe frequency is not a specific time that the alert runs every day. It's how often the alert rule runs.There are some limitations to using an alert rule frequency ofone minute. When you set the alert rule frequency to one minute, an internal manipulation is performed to optimize the query. This manipulation can cause the query to fail if it contains unsupported operations. The most common reasons why a query isn't supported are:The query contains thesearch,union, ortake(limit) operation.The query contains theingestion_time()function.The query uses theadxpattern.The query calls a function that calls other tables.Sample log search alert queriesare available for Azure Data Explorer and Resource Graph.

(Optional) In theAdvanced optionssection, you can specify the number of failures and the alert evaluation period that's required to trigger an alert. For example, if you setAggregation granularityto 5 minutes, you can specify that you want to trigger an alert only if three failures (15 minutes) happened in the last hour. Your application's business policy determines this setting.Select values for these fields underNumber of violations to trigger the alert:FieldDescriptionNumber of violationsThe number of violations that trigger the alert. Notice that in order to use this the query should include 'datetime' column in the query results.Evaluation periodThe time period within which the number of violations occur.Override query time rangeIf you want the alert evaluation period to be different from the query time range, enter a time range here.The alert time range is limited to a maximum of two days. Even if the query contains anagocommand with a time range of longer than two days, the two-day maximum time range is applied. For example, even if the query text containsago(7d), the query only scans up to two days of data. If the query requires more data than the alert evaluation, you can change the time range manually. If the query contains anagocommand, it changes automatically to two days (48 hours).NoteIf you or your administrator assigned the Azure policyAzure Log Search Alerts over Log Analytics workspaces should use customer-managed keys, you must selectCheck workspace linked storage. If you don't, the rule creation will fail because it won't meet the policy requirements.

This identity has no permissions and is automatically deleted when the rule is deleted. After you create the rule, you must assign permissions to this identity to access the necessary workspace and data sources for the query. For more information about assigning permissions, seeAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal. Log search alert rules that use linked storage are not supported.Enable user assigned managed identityBefore you create the alert rule, youcreate an identityand assign it appropriate permissions for the log query. This is a regular Azure identity. You can use one identity in multiple alert rules. The identity isn't deleted when the rule is deleted. When you select this type of identity, a pane opens for you to select the associated identity for the rule.
In theIdentitysection, select which identity the log search alert rule uses for authentication when it sends the log query.
Keep these points in mind when you're selecting an identity:
A managed identity is required if you're sending a query to Azure Data Explorer or Resource Graph.
Use a managed identity if you want to be able to view or edit the permissions associated with the alert rule.
If you don't use a managed identity, the alert rule permissions are based on the permissions of the last user to edit the rule, at the time that the rule was last edited.
Use a managed identity to help you avoid a case where the rule doesn't work as expected because the user who last edited the rule didn't have permissions for all the resources added to the scope of the rule.
The identity associated with the rule must have these roles:
If the query is accessing a Log Analytics workspace, the identity must be assigned areaderrole for all workspaces that the query accesses. If you're creating resource-centric log search alerts, the alert rule might access multiple workspaces, and the identity must have a reader role on all of them.

Select one of the following options for the identity that the alert rule uses:

(Optional) In theAdvanced optionssection, you can set several options:FieldDescriptionEnable upon creationSelect this option to make the alert rule start running as soon as you finish creating it.Automatically resolve alertsSelect this option to make the alert stateful. When an alert is stateful, the alert is resolved when the condition is no longer met for a specific time range. The time range differs based on the frequency of the alert:1 minute: The alert condition isn't met for 10 minutes.5 to 15 minutes: The alert condition isn't met for three frequency periods.15 minutes to 11 hours: The alert condition isn't met for two frequency periods.11 to 12 hours: The alert condition isn't met for one frequency period.Note that stateful log search alerts havethese limitations.Mute actionsSelect this option to set a period of time to wait before alert actions are triggered again. In theMute actions forfield that appears, select the amount of time to wait after an alert is fired before triggering actions again.Check workspace linked storageSelect this option if workspace linked storage for alerts is configured. If no linked storage is configured, the rule isn't created.
(Optional) In theAdvanced optionssection, you can set several options:
(Optional) In theCustom propertiessection, if this alert rule contains action groups, you can add your own properties to include in the alert notification payload. You can use these properties in the actions that the action group calls, such as by a webhook, Azure function, or logic app action.The custom properties are specified as key/value pairs by using static text, a dynamic value extracted from the alert payload, or a combination of both.The format for extracting a dynamic value from the alert payload is:${<path to schema field>}. For example:${data.essentials.monitorCondition}.Use the format of thecommon alert schemato specify the field in the payload, whether or not the action groups configured for the alert rule use the common schema.NoteCustom properties are added to the payload of the alert, but they don't appear in the email template or in the alert details in the Azure portal.The following examples use values inCustom propertiesto utilize data from a payload that uses the common alert schema.This example creates anAdditional Detailstag with data regarding the window start time and window end time:Name:Additional DetailsValue:Evaluation windowStartTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowStartTime}. windowEndTime: ${data.alertContext.condition.windowEndTime}Result:AdditionalDetails:Evaluation windowStartTime: 2023-04-04T14:39:24.492Z. windowEndTime: 2023-04-04T14:44:24.492ZThis example adds data regarding the reason for resolving or firing the alert:Name:Alert ${data.essentials.monitorCondition} reasonValue:${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].metricName} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].operator} ${data.alertContext.condition.allOf[0].threshold} ${data.essentials.monitorCondition}.
