Automate API deployments with APIOps
APIOps is a methodology that applies the concepts of GitOps andDevOpsto API deployment. Like DevOps,APIOpshelps team members easily make changes and deploy them in an iterative and automated way. This architecture demonstrates how you can improve the entire API lifecycle and API quality by using APIOps.

Scenario details
APIOps uses version control to manage APIs and create an audit trail of changes to APIs, policies, and operations.
API developers who use an APIOps methodology review and audit APIs earlier and more frequently, catching and resolving deviations from API standards faster to improve specifications and API quality. The more APIs that you build and deploy with an APIOps approach, the greater the consistency between APIs.
This APIOps architecture usesAzure API Managementas the API management platform.Azure DevOpsorganizes API management.Azure Reposprovides Git functionality, andAzure Pipelinescreates the CI/CD pipeline.
Potential use cases

Considerations
These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, seeWell-Architected Framework.
Security
Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Security.
This solution provides several security-related benefits. Individual developersâand even operatorsâdon't directly access the API Management instance to apply changes or updates. Instead, users push changes to a Git repository, and the extractor and publishing pipelines read and apply them to the API Management instance. This approach follows the security best practice ofleast privilegeby not giving teams write permissions to the API Management service instance. In diagnostic or troubleshooting scenarios, you can grant elevated permissions for a limited time on a case-by-case basis.
To make sure the API Management instances are using best practices for security, you can extend this solution to enforce API best practices by using third-party tools and unit testing. Teams can provide early feedback via PR review if the proposed changes to an API or policy violate standards.
Apart from the task of setting up repository permissions, consider implementing the following security measures in Git repositories that synchronize to API Management instances:
Pull Request (PR) Review: Use branches and protect the branches that represent the state of the API Management instances from having changes pushed to them directly. Require PRs to have at least one reviewer to enforce the four-eyes principle.
Immutable history: Only allow new commits on top of existing changes. Immutable history is especially important for auditing purposes.
Multi-factor authentication: Require your users to activate two-factor authentication.
Signed Commits: Allow only signed commits that can't be altered after the fact.

Operational Excellence
Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Operational Excellence.
APIOps can increase DevOps productivity for API development and deployments. One of the most useful features is the ability to use Git operations to quickly roll back changes that behave unexpectedly. The commit graph contains all commits, so it can help with the post-mortem analysis.
API operators often manage multiple environments for the same set of APIs. It's typical to have several stages of an API deployed to different API Management instances or in a shared API Management instance. The Git repository, which is the single source of truth, shows which versions of applications are currently deployed to a cluster.
When someone makes a PR in the Git repository, the API operator knows they have new code to review. For example, when a developer takes the OpenAPI Specification and builds the API implementation, they add this new code to the repository. The operators can review the PR and make sure that the API that's been submitted for review meets best practices and standards.
Performance Efficiency
Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, seeDesign review checklist for Performance Efficiency.
APIOps has many benefits, but as API Management landscapes grow, so does the complexity of managing them. This solution helps meet challenges like:
Keeping an overview of all environments and API Management instances.
Tracking critical changes to APIs and policies.
Creating an audit trail for all deployed changes.
Deploy this scenario
Deploying this solution involves these steps:
Develop the API in the portal or make changes to the OpenAPI Specification by using a tool of your choice.If you make changes in the portal, you can run the extractor to automatically extract all the APIs and other relevant policies, operations, and configurations from API Management. You can synchronize this information to the Git repository.Optionally, use the Azure DevOps CLI tocreate a new pull request.

In our scenario, the pipeline that downloads changes in the portal to the API Management instance has the following stages:Build extractor,Create artifacts from portal, andCreate template branch.Build extractorThis stage builds the extractor code.Create artifacts from portalThis stage runs the extractor and creates artifacts that resemble a Git repository structure like that shown in the following screenshot:Create template branchAfter generating the artifact, this stage creates a PR with the changes extracted for the platform team to review.The first time you run the extractor, it pulls everything from the Git repository. The PR that's created will have all the APIs, policies, artifacts, and so on.Later extractions have only changes made before the extraction in the PR. Sometimes changes might be only to the specification of an API, which is the case in the following example of a PR.
