Review a prescriptive framework that includes the tools, programs, and content (best practices, configuration templates, and architecture guidance) to simplify adoption of Kubernetes and cloud-native practices at scale.
The list of required actions is categorized by persona to drive a successful deployment of applications on Kubernetes, from proof of concept to production, then scaling and optimization.
Get started
To prepare for this phase of the cloud adoption lifecycle, use the following exercises:
Application development and deployment: Examine patterns and practices of application development, configure continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and implement site reliability engineering (SRE) best practices.
Cluster design and operations: Identify for cluster configuration and network design. Ensure future scalability by automating infrastructure provisioning. Maintain high availability by planning for business continuity and disaster recovery.
Cluster and application security: Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes security essentials. Review the secure setup for clusters and application security guidance.
AKS landing zone accelerator: The AKS landing zone accelerator provides an architectural approach and reference implementation that enables effective workload and scenario operationalization of landing zones on Azure, at scale and aligned with the Azure roadmap and the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.
