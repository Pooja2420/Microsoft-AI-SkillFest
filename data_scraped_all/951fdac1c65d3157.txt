This article describes how to set up provisioning to the Azure Databricks account using Microsoft Entra ID.
You can also sync users and groups from Microsoft Entra ID using automatic identity management (Public Preview). Automatic identity management does not require you to configure an application in Microsoft Entra ID. It also supports syncing Microsoft Entra ID service principals and nested groups to Azure Databricks, which is not supported using SCIM provisioning. For more information, seeSync users and groups automatically from Microsoft Entra ID.
Note
The way provisioning is configured is entirely separate from configuring authentication and conditional access for Azure Databricks workspaces or accounts. Authentication for Azure Databricks is handled automatically by Microsoft Entra ID, using the OpenID Connect protocol flow. You can configureconditional access, which lets you create rules to require multi-factor authentication or restrict logins to local networks, at the service level.
Provision identities to your Azure Databricks account using Microsoft Entra ID
You can sync account-level users and groups from your Microsoft Entra ID tenant to Azure Databricks using a SCIM provisioning connector.
Important
If you already have SCIM connectors that sync identities directly to your workspaces, you must disable those SCIM connectors when the account-level SCIM connector is enabled. SeeMigrate workspace-level SCIM provisioning to the account level.
Requirements
Your Azure Databricks account must have thePremium plan.
You must have the Cloud Application Administrator role in Microsoft Entra ID.
Your Microsoft Entra ID account must be a Premium edition account to provision groups. Provisioning users is available for any Microsoft Entra ID edition.
You must be an Azure Databricks account admin.
Note
To enable the account console and establish your first account admin, seeEstablish your first account admin.
Step 1: Configure Azure Databricks
As an Azure Databricks account admin, log in to the Azure Databricksaccount console.
ClickSettings.
ClickUser Provisioning.
ClickSet up user provisioning.
Copy the SCIM token and the Account SCIM URL. You will use these to configure your Microsoft Entra ID application.
Note
The SCIM token is restricted to the Account SCIM API/api/2.1/accounts/{account_id}/scim/v2/and cannot be used to authenticate to other Databricks REST APIs.
/api/2.1/accounts/{account_id}/scim/v2/
Step 2: Configure the enterprise application
These instructions tell you how to create an enterprise application in the Azure portal and use that application for provisioning. If you have an existing enterprise application, you can modify it toautomate SCIM provisioning using Microsoft Graph. This removes the need for a separate provisioning application in the Azure Portal.
Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra ID to sync users and groups to your Azure Databricks account. This configuration is separate from any configurations you have created to sync users and groups to workspaces.
In your Azure portal, go toMicrosoft Entra ID > Enterprise Applications.
Click+ New Applicationabove the application list. UnderAddfrom the gallery, search for and selectAzure Databricks SCIM Provisioning Connector.
Enter aNamefor the application and clickAdd.
Under theManagemenu, clickProvisioning.
SetProvisioning Modeto Automatic.
Set theSCIM API endpoint URLto the Account SCIM URL that you copied earlier.
SetSecret Tokento the Azure Databricks SCIM token that you generated earlier.
ClickTest Connectionand wait for the message that confirms that the credentials are authorized to enable provisioning.
ClickSave.
Step 3: Assign users and groups to the application
Users and groups assigned to the SCIM application will be provisioned to the Azure Databricks account. If you have existing Azure Databricks workspaces, Databricks recommends that you add all existing users and groups in those workspaces to the SCIM application.
Note
Microsoft Entra ID does not support the automatic provisioning of service principals to Azure Databricks. You can add service principals your Azure Databricks account followingAdd service principals to your account.
Microsoft Entra ID does not support the automatic provisioning of nested groups to Azure Databricks. Microsoft Entra ID can only read and provision users that are immediate members of the explicitly assigned group. As a workaround, explicitly assign (or otherwise scope in) the groups that contain the users who need to be provisioned. For more information, seethis FAQ.
Go toManage > Properties.
SetAssignment requiredtoNo. Databricks recommends this option, which allows all users to sign in to the Azure Databricks account.
Go toManage > Provisioning.
To start synchronizing Microsoft Entra ID users and groups to Azure Databricks, set theProvisioning Statustoggle toOn.
ClickSave.
Go toManage > Users and groups.
ClickAdd user/group, select the users and groups, and click theAssignbutton.
Wait a few minutes and check that the users and groups exist in your Azure Databricks account.
Users and groups that you add and assign will automatically be provisioned to the Azure Databricks account when Microsoft Entra ID schedules the next sync.
Note
If you remove a user from the account-level SCIM application, that user is deactivated from the account and from their workspaces, regardless of whether or not identity federation has been enabled.
Provisioning tips
Users and groups that existed in the Azure Databricks account prior to enabling provisioning exhibit the following behavior upon provisioning sync:Users and groups are merged if they also exist in Microsoft Entra ID.Users and groups are ignored if they donât exist in Microsoft Entra ID. Users that donât exist in Microsoft Entra ID cannot log in to Azure Databricks.
Users and groups are merged if they also exist in Microsoft Entra ID.
Users and groups are ignored if they donât exist in Microsoft Entra ID. Users that donât exist in Microsoft Entra ID cannot log in to Azure Databricks.
Individually assigned user permissions that are duplicated by membership in a group remain even after the group membership is removed for the user.
Directly removing users from an Azure Databricks account using the account console has the following effects:The removed user loses access to that Azure Databricks account and all workspaces in the account.The removed user will not be synced again using Microsoft Entra ID provisioning, even if they remain in the enterprise application.
The removed user loses access to that Azure Databricks account and all workspaces in the account.
The removed user will not be synced again using Microsoft Entra ID provisioning, even if they remain in the enterprise application.
The initial Microsoft Entra ID sync is triggered immediately after you enable provisioning. Subsequent syncs are triggered every 20-40 minutes, depending on the number of users and groups in the application. SeeProvisioning summary reportin the Microsoft Entra ID documentation.
You cannot update the email address of an Azure Databricks user.
You cannot sync nested groups or Microsoft Entra ID service principals from theAzure Databricks SCIM Provisioning Connectorapplication. Databricks recommends using the enterprise application to sync users and groups and manage nested groups and service principals within Azure Databricks. However, you can also use theDatabricks Terraform provideror custom scripts that target the Azure Databricks SCIM API to sync nested groups or Microsoft Entra ID service principals.
Updates to group names in Microsoft Entra ID do not sync into Azure Databricks.
The parametersuserNameandemails.valuemust match. A mismatch can lead to Azure Databricks rejecting user creation requests from the Microsoft Entra ID SCIM application. For cases such as external users or aliased emails, you might need to change the enterprise applicationâs default SCIM mapping to useuserPrincipalNamerather thanmail.
userName
emails.value
userPrincipalName
mail
(Optional) Automate SCIM provisioning using Microsoft Graph
Microsoft Graphincludes authentication and authorization libraries that you can integrate into your application to automate provisioning of users and groups to your Azure Databricks account or workspaces, instead of configuring a SCIM provisioning connector application.
Follow theinstructions for registering an application with Microsoft Graph. Make a note of theApplication IDand theTenant IDfor the application
Go to the applicationsâs Overview page. On that page:Configure a client secret for the application, and make a note of the secret.Grant the application these permissions:Application.ReadWrite.AllApplication.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
Configure a client secret for the application, and make a note of the secret.
Grant the application these permissions:Application.ReadWrite.AllApplication.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
Application.ReadWrite.All
Application.ReadWrite.All
Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
Ask a Microsoft Entra ID administrator togrant admin consent.
Update your applicationâs code toadd support for Microsoft Graph.
Troubleshooting
Users and groups do not sync
If you are using theAzure Databricks SCIM Provisioning Connectorapplication:In the account console verify that the Azure Databricks SCIM token that was used to set up provisioning is still valid.
In the account console verify that the Azure Databricks SCIM token that was used to set up provisioning is still valid.
Do not attempt to sync nested groups, which are not supported by Microsoft Entra ID automatic provisioning. For more information, seethis FAQ.
Microsoft Entra ID service principals do not sync
TheAzure Databricks SCIM Provisioning Connectorapplication does not support syncing service principals.
After initial sync, the users and groups stop syncing
If you are using theAzure Databricks SCIM Provisioning Connectorapplication: After the initial sync, Microsoft Entra ID does not sync immediately after you change user or group assignments. It schedules a sync with the application after a delay, based on the number of users and groups. To request an immediate sync, go toManage > Provisioningfor the enterprise application and selectClear current state and restart synchronization.
Microsoft Entra ID provisioning service IP range not accessible
The Microsoft Entra ID provisioning service operates under specific IP ranges. If you need to restrict network access, you must allow traffic from the IP addresses forAzureActiveDirectoryin the Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â Public Cloud file. Download from theMicrosoft download site. For more information, seeIP Ranges.
