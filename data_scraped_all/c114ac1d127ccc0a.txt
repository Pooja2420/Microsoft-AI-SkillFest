This article describes how to access and use the Kubernetes dashboard to monitor your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. To monitor your device, you can use charts in Azure portal, view the Kubernetes dashboard, or runkubectlcommands via the PowerShell interface of the device.
kubectl
This article focuses only on the monitoring tasks that can be performed on the Kubernetes dashboard.
In this article, you learn how to:
Access the Kubernetes dashboard on your device
View modules deployed on your device
Get IP address for applications deployed on your device
View container logs for modules deployed on your device
About Kubernetes Dashboard
Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based user interface that you can use to troubleshoot your containerized applications. Kubernetes Dashboard is a UI-based alternative to the Kuberneteskubectlcommand line. For more information, seeKubernetes Dashboard.
kubectl
On your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, you can use the Kubernetes Dashboard inread-onlymode to get an overview of the applications running on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device, view status of Kubernetes cluster resources, and see any errors that have occurred on the device.
Access dashboard
The Kubernetes Dashboard isread-onlyand runs on the Kubernetes master node at port 31000. Follow these steps to access the dashboard:
In the local UI of your device, go toDeviceand then go toDevice endpoints.

Copy theKubernetes dashboardendpoint. Create a DNS entry into theC:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hostsfile of your client to connect to the Kubernetes dashboard.<IP address of the Kubernetes dashboard>    <Kubernetes dashboard endpoint suffix>

View module status
Compute modules are containers that have a business logic implemented. You can use the dashboard to verify if a compute module has deployed successfully on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device.
To view the module status, follow these steps on the dashboard:
In the left-pane of the dashboard, go toNamespace. Filter by the namespace where IoT Edge modules are displayed, in this case,iotedge.
In the left-pane of the dashboard, go toNamespace. Filter by the namespace where IoT Edge modules are displayed, in this case,iotedge.
In the left-pane, go toWorkloads > Deployments.
In the left-pane, go toWorkloads > Deployments.
In the right-pane, you will see all the modules deployed on your device. In this case, a GettingStartedWithGPU module was deployed on the Azure Stack Edge Pro. You can see that the module was deployed.
In the right-pane, you will see all the modules deployed on your device. In this case, a GettingStartedWithGPU module was deployed on the Azure Stack Edge Pro. You can see that the module was deployed.

Get IP address for services or modules
You can use the dashboard to get the IP addresses of the services or modules that you want to expose outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
You assign the IP range for these external services via the local web UI of the device in theCompute network settingspage. After you have deployed IoT Edge modules, you may want to get the IP address assigned to a specific module or service.
To get the IP address, follow these steps on the dashboard:
In the left-pane of the dashboard, go toNamespace. Filter by the namespace where an external service is deployed, in this case,iotedge.
In the left-pane of the dashboard, go toNamespace. Filter by the namespace where an external service is deployed, in this case,iotedge.
In the left-pane, go toDiscovery and Load balancing > Services.
In the left-pane, go toDiscovery and Load balancing > Services.
In the right-pane, you will see all the services that are running in theiotedgenamespace on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device.

View container logs
There are instances where you need to view the container logs. You can use the dashboard to get logs for a specific container that you have deployed on your Kubernetes cluster.
To view the container logs, follow these steps on the dashboard:
In the left-pane of the dashboard, go toNamespace. Filter by the namespace where the IoT Edge modules are deployed, in this case,iotedge.
In the left-pane of the dashboard, go toNamespace. Filter by the namespace where the IoT Edge modules are deployed, in this case,iotedge.
In the left-pane, go toWorkloads > Pods.
In the left-pane, go toWorkloads > Pods.
In the right-pane, you will see all the pods running on your device. Identify the pod that is running the module for which you want to view the logs. Select the vertical ellipsis for the pod that you identified and from the context menu, selectLogs.
In the right-pane, you will see all the pods running on your device. Identify the pod that is running the module for which you want to view the logs. Select the vertical ellipsis for the pod that you identified and from the context menu, selectLogs.

The logs are displayed in a logs viewer that is built into the dashboard. You can also download the logs.

View CPU, memory usage
The Kubernetes dashboard for Azure Stack Edge Pro device also has aMetrics server add-onthat aggregates the CPU and memory usage across Kubernetes resources.
For example, you can view the CPU and memory consumed across deployments in all namespaces.

You could also filter by a specific namespace. In the following example, you could view the CPU and memory consumption only for Azure Arc deployments.

The Kubernetes metrics server provides autoscaling pipelines such asHorizontal Pod Autoscaler.
