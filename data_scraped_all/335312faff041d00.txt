Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events, such as the creation and deletion of blobs. It does so without the need for complicated code or expensive and inefficient polling services. The best part is you only pay for what you use.
Blob storage events are pushed usingAzure Event Gridto subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own http listener. Event Grid provides reliable event delivery to your applications through rich retry policies and dead-lettering.
See theBlob storage events schemaarticle to view the full list of the events that Blob storage supports.
Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file-oriented workflow. Asynchronous file uploads are a great fit for events. When changes are infrequent, but your scenario requires immediate responsiveness, event-based architecture can be especially efficient.
If you want to try blob storage events, see any of these quickstart articles:

Storage (general purpose v1)doesnotsupport integration with Event Grid.
The event model
Event Grid usesevent subscriptionsto route event messages to subscribers. This image illustrates the relationship between event publishers, event subscriptions, and event handlers.

First, subscribe an endpoint to an event. Then, when an event is triggered, the Event Grid service will send data about that event to the endpoint.

Filtering events
Blobevents can be filteredby the event type, container name, or name of the object that was created/deleted. Filters in Event Grid match the beginning or end of the subject so events with a matching subject go to the subscriber.
To learn more about how to apply filters, seeFilter events for Event Grid.
The subject of Blob storage events uses the format:
/blobServices/default/containers/<containername>/blobs/<blobname>
/blobServices/default/containers/<containername>/blobs/<blobname>
To match all events for a storage account, you can leave the subject filters empty.
To match events from blobs created in a set of containers sharing a prefix, use asubjectBeginsWithfilter like:
subjectBeginsWith
/blobServices/default/containers/containerprefix
/blobServices/default/containers/containerprefix
To match events from blobs created in specific container, use asubjectBeginsWithfilter like:
subjectBeginsWith
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/
To match events from blobs created in specific container sharing a blob name prefix, use asubjectBeginsWithfilter like:
subjectBeginsWith
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/blobs/blobprefix
/blobServices/default/containers/containername/blobs/blobprefix
To match events from blobs created in specific container sharing a blob suffix, use asubjectEndsWithfilter like ".log" or ".jpg". For more information, seeEvent Grid Concepts.

Practices for consuming events
Applications that handle Blob storage events should follow a few recommended practices:
As multiple subscriptions can be configured to route events to the same event handler, it is important not to assume events are from a particular source, but to check the topic of the message to ensure that it comes from the storage account you are expecting.

Similarly, check that the eventType is one you are prepared to process, and do not assume that all events you receive will be the types you expect.

While most messages arrive in near real-time, there is no service level agreement around the time it takes for a message to arrive. In some instances, it might take few minutes for the message to arrive. As messages can arrive after some delay, use the etag fields to understand if your information about objects is still up-to-date. To learn how to use the etag field, seeManage concurrency in Blob Storage.

As messages can arrive out of order, use the sequencer fields to understand the order of events on any particular object. The sequencer field is a string value that represents the logical sequence of events for any particular blob name. You can use standard string comparison to understand the relative sequence of two events on the same blob name.

Storage events guarantees at-least-once delivery to subscribers, which ensures that all messages are outputted. However due to retries between backend nodes and services or availability of subscriptions, duplicate messages may occur. To learn more about message delivery and retry, seeEvent Grid message delivery and retry.

Use the blobType field to understand what type of operations are allowed on the blob, and which client library types you should use to access the blob. Valid values are eitherBlockBloborPageBlob.

If you want to ensure that theMicrosoft.Storage.BlobCreatedevent is triggered only when a Block Blob is completely committed, filter the event for theCopyBlob,PutBlob,PutBlockListorFlushWithCloseREST API calls. These API calls trigger theMicrosoft.Storage.BlobCreatedevent only after data is fully committed to a Block Blob. To learn how to create a filter, seeFilter events for Event Grid.

Feature support
Support for this feature might be impacted by enabling Data Lake Storage Gen2, Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol, or the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). If you've enabled any of these capabilities, seeBlob Storage feature support in Azure Storage accountsto assess support for this feature.
