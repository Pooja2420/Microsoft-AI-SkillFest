When you enable encryption at host, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. For conceptual information on encryption at host, and other managed disk encryption types, see:Encryption at host - End-to-end encryption for your VM data.
Temporary disks and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed keys, depending on what you select as the disk encryption type for the OS disk. The OS and data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed keys, depending on what you select as the disk encryption type. For example, if a disk is encrypted with customer-managed keys, then the cache for the disk is encrypted with customer-managed keys, and if a disk is encrypted with platform-managed keys then the cache for the disk is encrypted with platform-managed keys.
Restrictions
Supported for 4k sector size Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2.
Only supported on 512e sector size Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 if they were created after 5/13/2023.For disks created before this date,snapshot your diskand create a new disk using the snapshot.
For disks created before this date,snapshot your diskand create a new disk using the snapshot.
Can't be enabled on virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets that currently or ever had Azure Disk Encryption enabled.
Azure Disk Encryption can't be enabled on disks that have encryption at host enabled.
The encryption can be enabled on existing virtual machine scale sets. However, only new VMs created after enabling the encryption are automatically encrypted.
Existing VMs must be deallocated and reallocated in order to be encrypted.
Supported VM sizes
Legacy VM Sizes aren't supported. You can find the list of supported VM sizes by either using theAzure PowerShell moduleorAzure CLI.
Prerequisites
You must enable the feature for your subscription before you can use encryption at host for either your VM or Virtual Machine Scale Set. Use the following steps to enable the feature for your subscription:

You've now deployed a VM with encryption at host enabled, and the cache for the disk is encrypted using platform-managed keys.
Deploy a VM with customer-managed keys
Alternatively, you can use customer-managed keys to encrypt your disk caches.
Create an Azure Key Vault and disk encryption set
Once the feature is enabled, you need to set up an Azure Key Vault and a disk encryption set, if you haven't already.
Setting up customer-managed keys for your disks requires you to create resources in a particular order, if you're doing it for the first time. First, you'll need to create and set up an Azure Key Vault.

Enter a key vault name, select a region, and select a pricing tier.NoteWhen creating the Key Vault instance, you must enable soft delete and purge protection. Soft delete ensures that the Key Vault holds a deleted key for a given retention period (90 day default). Purge protection ensures that a deleted key cannot be permanently deleted until the retention period lapses. These settings protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks.
