Important
IoT Edge 1.5 LTS is thesupported release. IoT Edge 1.4 LTS is end of life as of November 12, 2024. If you are on an earlier release, seeUpdate IoT Edge.
Create anIoT Edge automatic deploymentin the Azure portal to manage ongoing deployments for many devices at once. Automatic deployments for IoT Edge are part of thedevice managementfeature of IoT Hub. Deployments are dynamic processes that enable you to deploy multiple modules to multiple devices, track the status and health of the modules, and make changes when necessary.
For more information, seeUnderstand IoT Edge automatic deployments for single devices or at scale.
Identify devices using tags
Before you can create a deployment, you have to be able to specify which devices you want to affect. Azure IoT Edge identifies devices usingtagsin the device twin. Each device can have multiple tags that you define in any way that makes sense for your solution.
For example, if you manage a campus of smart buildings, you might add location, room type, and environment tags to a device:
"tags":{
  "location":{
    "building": "20",
    "floor": "2"
  },
  "roomtype": "conference",
  "environment": "prod"
}
"tags":{
  "location":{
    "building": "20",
    "floor": "2"
  },
  "roomtype": "conference",
  "environment": "prod"
}
For more information about device twins and tags, seeUnderstand and use device twins in IoT Hub.
Create a deployment
IoT Edge provides two different types of automatic deployments that you can use to customize your scenario. You can create a standarddeployment, which includes that system runtime modules and any additional modules and routes. Each device can only apply one deployment. Or you can create alayered deployment, which only includes custom modules and routes, not the system runtime. Many layered deployments can be combined on a device, on top of a standard deployment. For more information about how the two types of automatic deployments work together, seeUnderstand IoT Edge automatic deployments for single devices or at scale.
The steps for creating a deployment and a layered deployment are similar. Any differences are called out in the following steps.
In theAzure portal, go to your IoT Hub.
On the menu in the left pane, selectConfigurations + DeploymentsunderDevice Management.
On the upper bar, selectAdd>Add DeploymentorAdd Layered Deployment.
There are five steps to create a deployment. The following sections walk through each one.
Note
The steps in this article reflect the latest schema version of the IoT Edge agent and hub.
If you are deploying to a device running version 1.0.9 or earlier, edit theRuntime Settingsin theModulesstep of the wizard to use schema version 1.0.
Step 1: Name and label
Give your deployment a unique name that is up to 128 lowercase letters. Avoid spaces and the following invalid characters:& ^ [ ] { } \ | " < > /.
& ^ [ ] { } \ | " < > /
You can add labels as key-value pairs to help track your deployments. For example,HostPlatformandLinux, orVersionand3.0.1.
SelectNext: Modulesto move to step two.
Step 2: Modules
You can add up to 50 modules to a deployment. If you create a deployment with no modules, it removes any current modules from the target devices.
In deployments, you can manage the settings for the IoT Edge agent and IoT Edge hub modules. SelectRuntime Settingsto configure the two runtime modules. In layered deployment, the runtime modules are not included so cannot be configured.
To add custom code as a module, or to manually add an Azure service module, follow these steps:
In theContainer Registry Settingssection of the page, provide the credentials to access any private container registries that contain your module images.

In theIoT Edge Modulessection of the page, selectAdd.
In theIoT Edge Modulessection of the page, selectAdd.
Choose one of the types of modules from the drop-down menu:IoT Edge Module- You provide the module name and container image URI. For example, the image URI for the sample SimulatedTemperatureSensor module ismcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0. For a list of Microsoft IoT Edge module images, see theMicrosoft Artifact Registry.Azure Stream Analytics Module- Modules generated from an Azure Stream Analytics workload.

If needed, repeat steps 2 and 3 to add additional modules to your deployment.
If needed, repeat steps 2 and 3 to add additional modules to your deployment.
After you add a module to a deployment, you can select its name to open theUpdate IoT Edge Modulepage. On this page, you can edit the module settings, environment variables, create options, startup order, and module twin. If you added a module from the marketplace, it may already have some of these parameters filled in. For more information about the available module settings, seeModule configuration and management.
If you're creating a layered deployment, you may be configuring a module that exists in other deployments targeting the same devices. To update the module twin without overwriting other versions, open theModule Twin Settingstab. Create a newModule Twin Propertywith a unique name for a subsection within the module twin's desired properties, for exampleproperties.desired.settings. If you define properties within just theproperties.desiredfield, it overwrites the desired properties for the module defined in any lower priority deployments.
properties.desired.settings
properties.desired

For more information about module twin configuration in layered deployments, seeLayered deployment.
Once you have all the modules for a deployment configured, selectNext: Routesto move to step three.
Step 3: Routes
On theRoutestab, you define how messages are passed between modules and the IoT Hub. Messages are constructed using name/value pairs.
For example, a route with a namerouteand a valueFROM /messages/* INTO $upstreamwould take any messages output by any modules and send them to your IoT hub.
ThePriorityandTime to liveparameters are optional parameters that you can include in a route definition. The priority parameter allows you to choose which routes should have their messages processed first, or which routes should be processed last. Priority is determined by setting a number 0-9, where 0 is top priority. The time to live parameter allows you to declare how long messages in that route should be held until they're either processed or removed from the queue.
For more information about how to create routes, seeDeclare routes.
SelectNext: Target Devices.
Step 4: Target devices
Use the tags property from your devices to target the specific devices that should receive this deployment.
Since multiple deployments may target the same device, you should give each deployment a priority number. If there's ever a conflict, the deployment with the highest priority (larger values indicate higher priority) wins. If two deployments have the same priority number, the one that was created most recently wins.
If multiple deployments target the same device, then only the one with the higher priority is applied. If multiple layered deployments target the same device then they are all applied. However, if any properties are duplicated, like if there are two routes with the same name, then the one from the higher priority layered deployment overwrites the rest.
Any layered deployment targeting a device must have a higher priority than the base deployment in order to be applied.
Enter a positive integer for the deploymentPriority.
Enter aTarget conditionto determine which devices are targeted with this deployment. The condition is based on device twin tags or device twin reported properties and should match the expression format. For example,tags.environment='test'orproperties.reported.devicemodel='4000x'.
tags.environment='test'
properties.reported.devicemodel='4000x'
SelectNext: Metrics.
Step 5: Metrics
Metrics provide summary counts of the various states that a device may report back as a result of applying configuration content.
Enter a name forMetric Name.
Enter a name forMetric Name.
Enter a query forMetric Criteria. The query is based on IoT Edge hub module twinreported properties. The metric represents the number of rows returned by the query.For example:SELECT deviceId FROM devices
  WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200
Enter a query forMetric Criteria. The query is based on IoT Edge hub module twinreported properties. The metric represents the number of rows returned by the query.
For example:
SELECT deviceId FROM devices
  WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200
SELECT deviceId FROM devices
  WHERE properties.reported.lastDesiredStatus.code = 200
SelectNext: Review + Createto move on to the final step.
Step 6: Review and create
Review your deployment information, then selectCreate.
To monitor your deployment, seeMonitor IoT Edge deployments.
Note
When a new IoT Edge deployment is created, sometimes it can take up to 5 minutes for the IoT Hub to process the new configuration and propagate the new desired properties to the targeted devices.
Modify a deployment
When you modify a deployment, the changes immediately replicate to all targeted devices. You can modify the following settings and features for an existing deployment:
Target conditions
Custom metrics
Labels
Tags
Desired properties
Modify target conditions, custom metrics, and labels

Delete a deployment
When you delete a deployment, any deployed devices take on their next highest priority deployment. If your devices don't meet the target condition of any other deployment, then the modules are not removed when the deployment is deleted.
Sign in to theAzure portaland navigate to your IoT Hub.
SelectConfigurations + Deployments.
Use the checkbox to select the deployment that you want to delete.
SelectDelete.
A prompt informs you that this action deletes this deployment and revert to the previous state for all devices. A deployment with a lower priority will apply. If no other deployment is targeted, no modules are removed. If you want to remove all modules from your device, create a deployment with zero modules and deploy it to the same devices. SelectYesto continue.
