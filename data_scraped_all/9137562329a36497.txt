Applies to: Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal, Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal
In this article
This article describes how to use theSyslog via AMAandCommon Event Format (CEF) via AMAconnectors to quickly filter and ingest syslog messages, including messages in Common Event Format (CEF), from Linux machines and from network and security devices and appliances. To learn more about these data connectors, seeSyslog and Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA connectors for Microsoft Sentinel.
Note
Container Insights now supports the automatic collection of Syslog events from Linux nodes in your AKS clusters. To learn more, seeSyslog collection with Container Insights.

Log forwarder prerequisites
If you're collecting messages from a log forwarder, the following prerequisites apply:
You must have a designated Linux VM as a log forwarder to collect logs.Create a Linux VM in the Azure portal.Supported Linux operating systems for Azure Monitor Agent.

If your log forwarderisn'tan Azure virtual machine, it must have the Azure ArcConnected Machine agentinstalled on it.
If your log forwarderisn'tan Azure virtual machine, it must have the Azure ArcConnected Machine agentinstalled on it.
The Linux log forwarder VM must have Python 2.7 or 3 installed. Use thepython --versionorpython3 --versioncommand to check. If you're using Python 3, make sure it's set as the default command on the machine, or run scripts with the 'python3' command instead of 'python'.

Your log sources, security devices, and appliances, must be configured to send their log messages to the log forwarder's syslog daemon instead of to their local syslog daemon.
Your log sources, security devices, and appliances, must be configured to send their log messages to the log forwarder's syslog daemon instead of to their local syslog daemon.
Note
When deploying the AMA to a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS), you're strongly encouraged to use a load balancer that supports the round-robin method to ensure load distribution across all deployed instances.
Machine security prerequisites
Configure the machine's security according to your organization's security policy. For example, configure your network to align with your corporate network security policy and change the ports and protocols in the daemon to align with your requirements. To improve your machine security configuration,secure your VM in Azure, or review thesebest practices for network security.
If your devices are sending syslog and CEF logs over TLS because, for example, your log forwarder is in the cloud, you need to configure the syslog daemon (rsyslogorsyslog-ng) to communicate in TLS. For more information, see:
rsyslog
syslog-ng
Encrypt Syslog traffic with TLS â rsyslog
Encrypt log messages with TLS â syslog-ng
Configure the data connector
The setup process for the Syslog via AMA  or Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA data connectors includes the following steps:
Install the Azure Monitor Agent and create a Data Collection Rule (DCR) by using either of the following methods:Azure or Defender portalAzure Monitor Logs Ingestion API
Azure or Defender portal
Azure Monitor Logs Ingestion API
If you're collecting logs from other machines using a log forwarder,run the "installation" scripton the log forwarder to configure the syslog daemon to listen for messages from other machines, and to open the necessary local ports.
Select the appropriate tab for instructions.

Select facilities and severities
Be aware that using the same facility for both syslog and CEF messages might result in data ingestion duplication. For more information, seeData ingestion duplication avoidance.
In theCollecttab, select the minimum log level for each facility. When you select a log level, Microsoft Sentinel collects logs for the selected level and other levels with higher severity. For example, if you selectLOG_ERR, Microsoft Sentinel collects logs for theLOG_ERR,LOG_CRIT,LOG_ALERT, andLOG_EMERGlevels.

You can create Data Collection Rules (DCRs) using theAzure Monitor Logs Ingestion API. For more information, seeData collection rules in Azure Monitor.
Create the data collection rule
Create a JSON file for the data collection rule, create an API request, and send the request.
Prepare a DCR file in JSON format. The contents of this file is the request body in your API request.For an example, seeSyslog/CEF DCR creation request body. To collect syslog and CEF messages in the same data collection rule, see the exampleSyslog and CEF streams in the same DCR.Verify that thestreamsfield is set toMicrosoft-Syslogfor syslog messages, or toMicrosoft-CommonSecurityLogfor CEF messages.Add the filter and facility log levels in thefacilityNamesandlogLevelsparameters.

Sign in to the log forwarder machine where you just installed the AMA.
Paste the command you copied in the last step to launch the installation script.The script configures thersyslogorsyslog-ngdaemon to use the required protocol and restarts the daemon. The script opens port 514 to listen to incoming messages in both UDP and TCP protocols. To change this setting, refer to the syslog daemon configuration file according to the daemon type running on the machine:Rsyslog:/etc/rsyslog.confSyslog-ng:/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.confIf you're using Python 3, and it's not set as the default command on the machine, substitutepython3forpythonin the pasted command. SeeLog forwarder prerequisites.NoteTo avoidFull Disk scenarioswhere the agent can't function, we recommend that you set thesyslog-ngorrsyslogconfiguration not to store unneeded logs. A Full Disk scenario disrupts the function of the installed AMA.
For more information, seeRSyslogorSyslog-ng.
Paste the command you copied in the last step to launch the installation script.The script configures thersyslogorsyslog-ngdaemon to use the required protocol and restarts the daemon. The script opens port 514 to listen to incoming messages in both UDP and TCP protocols. To change this setting, refer to the syslog daemon configuration file according to the daemon type running on the machine:
rsyslog
syslog-ng
Rsyslog:/etc/rsyslog.conf
/etc/rsyslog.conf
Syslog-ng:/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
If you're using Python 3, and it's not set as the default command on the machine, substitutepython3forpythonin the pasted command. SeeLog forwarder prerequisites.

Note
To avoidFull Disk scenarioswhere the agent can't function, we recommend that you set thesyslog-ngorrsyslogconfiguration not to store unneeded logs. A Full Disk scenario disrupts the function of the installed AMA.

Configure the security device or appliance
Get specific instructions to configure your security device or appliance by going to one of the following articles:
CEF via AMA data connector - Configure specific appliances and devices for Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion
Syslog via AMA data connector - Configure specific appliances and devices for Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion
Contact the solution provider for more information or where information is unavailable for the appliance or device.
Test the connector
Verify that logs messages from your linux machine or security devices and appliances are ingested into Microsoft Sentinel.
To validate that the syslog daemon is running on the UDP port and that the AMA is listening, run this command:netstat -lnptvYou should see thersyslogorsyslog-ngdaemon listening on port 514.
