Caution
We recommend theAzure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distrofor new applications or customers to powerAzure Monitor Application Insights. The Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro delivers a similar functionality and experience as the Application Insights SDK. It's possible to migrate from the Application Insights SDK using the migration guides for.NET,Node.js, andPython, but we are still working to add afew more featuresfor backwards compatibility.
