Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure cloud service (classic)

Important
Cloud Services (classic) is now deprecated for all customers as of September 1st, 2024. Any existing running deployments will be stopped and shut down by Microsoft and the data will be permanently lost starting October 2024. New deployments should use the new Azure Resource Manager based deployment modelAzure Cloud Services (extended support).
When you create a Cloud Service, Azure assigns it to a subdomain ofcloudapp.net. For example, if your Cloud Service is namedcontoso, your users are able to access your application on a URL likehttp://contoso.cloudapp.net. Azure also assigns a virtual IP address.
contoso
http://contoso.cloudapp.net
However, you can also expose your application on your own domain name, such ascontoso.com. This article explains how to reserve or configure a custom domain name for Cloud Service web roles.
Do you already understand what CNAME and A records are?Jump past the explanation.
Note
The procedures in this task apply to Azure Cloud Services. For App Services, seeMap an existing custom DNS name to Azure Web Apps. For storage accounts, seeConfigure a custom domain name for your Azure Blob storage endpoint.

Tip
Get going faster--use the NEW Azureguided walkthrough!  It makes associating a custom domain name AND securing communication (TLS) with Azure Cloud Services or Azure Websites a snap.
Understand CNAME and A records
CNAME (or alias records) and A records both allow you to associate a domain name with a specific server (or service in this case); however, they work differently. There are also some specific considerations when using A records with Azure Cloud services that you should consider before deciding which to use.
CNAME or Alias record
A CNAME record maps aspecificdomain, such ascontoso.comorwww.contoso.com, to a canonical domain name. In this case, the canonical domain name is the[myapp].cloudapp.netdomain name of your Azure hosted application. Once created, the CNAME creates an alias for the[myapp].cloudapp.net. The CNAME entry resolves to the IP address of your[myapp].cloudapp.netservice automatically, so if the IP address of the cloud service changes, you don't have to take any action.
Note
Some domain registrars only allow you to map subdomains when using a CNAME record, such as www.contoso.com, and not root names, such as contoso.com. For more information on CNAME records, see the documentation provided by your registrar,the Wikipedia entry on CNAME record, or theIETF Domain Names - Implementation and Specificationdocument.
A record
AnArecord maps a domain, such ascontoso.comorwww.contoso.com,or a wildcard domainsuch as*.contoso.com, to an IP address. With an Azure Cloud Service, the virtual IP of the service. So the main benefit of an A record over a CNAME record is that you can have one entry that uses a wildcard, such as *.contoso.com, which would handle requests for multiple subdomains such asmail.contoso.com,login.contoso.com, orwww.contso.com.
Note
Since an A record is mapped to a static IP address, it cannot automatically resolve changes to the IP address of your Cloud Service. The IP address used by your Cloud Service is allocated the first time you deploy to an empty slot (either production or staging.) If you delete the deployment for the slot, the IP address is released by Azure and any future deployments to the slot may be given a new IP address.
Conveniently, the IP address of a given deployment slot (production or staging) is persisted when swapping between staging and production deployments or performing an in-place upgrade of an existing deployment. For more information on performing these actions, seeHow to manage cloud services.
Add a CNAME record for your custom domain
To create a CNAME record, you must add a new entry in the DNS table for your custom domain by using the tools provided by your registrar. Each registrar has a similar but slightly different method of specifying a CNAME record, but the concepts are the same.
Use one of these methods to find the.cloudapp.netdomain name assigned to your cloud service.Sign into theAzure portal, select your cloud service, look at theOverviewsection and then find theSite URLentry.ORInstall and configureAzure PowerShell, and then use the following command:Get-AzureDeployment -ServiceName yourservicename | Select UrlSave the domain name used in the URL returned by either method, as you need it when creating a CNAME record.

Now find where you can select or enter CNAMEs. You may have to select the record type from a drop-down or go to an advanced settings page. You should look for the wordsCNAME,Alias, orSubdomains.

You must also provide the domain or subdomain alias for the CNAME, such aswwwif you want to create an alias forwww.customdomain.com. If you want to create an alias for the root domain, it may be listed as the '@' symbol in your registrar's DNS tools.

Then, you must provide a canonical host name, which is your application'scloudapp.netdomain in this case.
For example, the following CNAME record forwards all traffic fromwww.contoso.comtocontoso.cloudapp.net, the custom domain name of your deployed application:
Note
A visitor ofwww.contoso.comwill never see the true host
(contoso.cloudapp.net), so the forwarding process is invisible to the
end user.
The preceding example only applies to traffic at thewwwsubdomain. Since you cannot use wildcards with CNAME records, you must create one CNAME for each domain/subdomain. If you want to direct  traffic from subdomains, such as *.contoso.com, to your cloudapp.net address, you can configure aURL RedirectorURL Forwardentry in your DNS settings, or create an A record.
Add an A record for your custom domain
To create an A record, you must first find the virtual IP address of your cloud service. Then add a new entry in the DNS table for your custom domain by using the tools provided by your registrar. Each registrar has a similar but slightly different method of specifying an A record, but the concepts are the same.
Use one of the following methods to get the IP address of your cloud service.Sign into theAzure portal, select your cloud service, look at theOverviewsection and then find thePublic IP addressesentry.ORInstall and configureAzure PowerShell, and then use the following command:get-azurevm -servicename yourservicename | get-azureendpoint -VM {$_.VM} | select VipSave the IP address, as you need it when creating an A record.

If you want to create a wildcard entry for all subdomains, enter*****.

For example, the following A record forwards all traffic fromcontoso.comto137.135.70.239, the IP address of your deployed application:
This example demonstrates creating an A record for the root domain. If you wish to create a wildcard entry to cover all subdomains, you would enter '*****' as the subdomain.
Warning
IP addresses in Azure are dynamic by default. You will probably want to use areserved IP addressto ensure that your IP address does not change.
