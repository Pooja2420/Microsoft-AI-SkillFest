In this article, you learn how to create and use a vector index for performingRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)in the Azure AI Foundry portal.
A vector index isn't required for RAG, but a vector query can match on semantically similar content, which is useful for RAG workloads.
Prerequisites
You must have:
An Azure AI Foundry project
AnAzure AI Search resource
You should have content in a supported format that provides sufficient information for a chat experience. It can be an existing index on Azure AI Search, or create a new index using content files in Azure Blob Storage, your local system, or data in Azure AI Foundry.
Create an index from the Chat playground
