Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 - Azure DevOps Server 2019
This article describes the valid security namespaces, lists the associated permissions, and provides links to more information. Security namespaces store access control lists (ACLs) on tokens, determining the level of access various entities have to perform specific actions on specific resources. These entities include:
Azure DevOps users
Azure DevOps organization owners
Members of Azure DevOps security groups
Azure DevOps service accounts
Azure DevOps service principals
Each family of resources, such as work items or Git repositories, is secured through a unique namespace. Each security namespace contains zero or more ACLs. An ACL includes a token, an inherit flag, and a set of zero or more access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE consists of an identity descriptor, an allowed permissions bitmask, and a denied permissions bitmask. Tokens are arbitrary strings representing resources in Azure DevOps.
Note
Namespaces and tokens are valid for all versions of Azure DevOps. Those listed here are valid for Azure DevOps 2019 and later versions. Namespaces are subject to change over time. To get the latest list of namespaces, exercise one of the command line tools or REST API. Some namespaces have been deprecated as listed in theDeprecated and read-only namespacessection later in this article. For more information, seeSecurity namespaces query
Permission management tools
The recommended method for managing permissions is through the web portal. However, to set permissions that are unavailable through the portal or to manage granular permissions, use command line tools or the REST API:
For Azure DevOps Services, use theaz devops security permissioncommands.
az devops security permission
For Azure DevOps Server, use the TFSSecurity commands.
For Azure DevOps Git repositories, use thetf git permission command-line tool.
For Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repositories, use theTFVC permission command-line tool.
For all Azure DevOps instances, you can also use theSecurity REST API.
Security namespaces and their IDs
Many security namespaces correspond to permissions you set through aSecurityorPermissionsweb portal page. Other namespaces or specific permissions aren't visible through the web portal and grant access by default to members of security groups or Azure DevOps service principals. These namespaces are grouped into the following categories based on how they're managed through the web portal:
Object-level
Project-level
Organization or collection-level
Server-level (on-premises only)
Role-based
Internal only
Hierarchy and tokens
A security namespace can be either hierarchical or flat. In a hierarchical namespace, tokens exist in a hierarchy where effective permissions are inherited from parent tokens to child tokens. In contrast, tokens in a flat namespace have no concept of a parent-child relationship between any two tokens.
Tokens in a hierarchical namespace either have a fixed length for each path part, or variable length.
If the tokens have variable-length path parts, then a separator character is used to distinguish where one path part ends and another begins.
Security tokens are case-insensitive. Example of tokens for different namespaces are provided in the following sections.
Object-level namespaces and permissions
The following table describes the namespaces that manage object-level permissions. Most of these permissions are managed through the web portal page for each object. Permissions are set at the project level and inherited at the object level unless explicitly changed.
