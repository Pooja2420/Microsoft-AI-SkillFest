Configure P2S VPN gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authentication â manually registered app
Article

In this article
This article helps you configure a point-to-site (P2S) VPN gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authentication and manually register the Azure VPN client. This type of configuration is supported only for OpenVPN protocol connections. While the steps and Audience values in this article do result in a working configuration, we recommend that you use theConfigure P2S VPN Gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authenticationarticle instead.
Important
We recommend using the newConfigure P2S VPN Gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authenticationarticle. The new article offers a more efficient setup process using the newMicrosoft-registered Azure VPN Client App IDAudience value. Additionally, the new Audience value now supports the Azure VPN Client for Linux. If your P2S User VPN gateway is already set up with the manually configured Azure VPN Client Audience values, you canmigrateto the new Microsoft-registered App ID.
Prerequisites
The steps in this article require a Microsoft Entra tenant. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra tenant, you can create one using the steps in theCreate a new tenantarticle. Note the following fields when creating your directory:
Organizational name
Initial domain name
If you already have an existing P2S gateway, the steps in this article help you configure the gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authentication. You can also create a new VPN gateway. The link to create a new gateway is included in this article.
Note
Microsoft Entra ID authentication is supported only for OpenVPNÂ® protocol connections and requires the Azure VPN Client.
Create Microsoft Entra tenant users
