The Msv2 and Mdsv2 Medium Memory VM Series features IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8280 (Cascade Lake) processor with an all core base frequency of 2.7 GHz and 4.0 GHz single core turbo frequency. With these VMs, customers achieve increased flexibility with local disk and diskless options. Customers also have access to a set of new isolated VM sizes with more CPU and memory that go up to 192 vCPU with 4 TiB of memory.
Note
Msv2 and Mdsv2 Medium Memory VMs are generation 2 only. For more information on generation 2 virtual machines, seeSupport for generation 2 VMs on Azure. Standard_M192is_v2, Standard_M192ims_v2, Standard_M192ids_v2, and Standard_M192idms_v2 will be retired on March 31, 2027.

Msv2 Medium Memory Diskless
1Msv2 and Mdsv2 medium memory VMs canbursttheir disk performance for up to 30 minutes at a time.
2Attaching Ultra Disk or Premium SSDs V2 toStandard_M192is_v2results in higher IOPs and MBps than standard premium disks:
Max uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD V2 throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/2000
Max burst uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD V2 disk throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/4000
Mdsv2 Medium Memory with Disk

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toReadOnlyorReadWrite.  For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toNone.

Expected network bandwidthis the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth.Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines. To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
