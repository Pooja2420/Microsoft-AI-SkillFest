Resource logs
This section lists the types of resource logs you can collect for this service. The section pulls from the list ofall resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor.
Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Kusto/clusters
Command
Azure Data Explorer command execution summary.
DataOperation
Azure Data Explorer data operation summary.
FailedIngestion
Failed ingestion operations logs provide detailed information about failed ingest operations. Logs include data source details, as well as error code and failure status (transient or permanent), that can be used for tracking the process of data source ingestion. Users can identify usage errors (permanent bad requests) and handle retries of transient failures. Ingestion logs are supported for queued ingestion to the ingestion endpoint using SDKs, data connections, and connectors.
IngestionBatching
Azure Data Explorer ingestion batching operations. These logs have detailed statistics of batches ready for ingestion (duration, batch size and blobs count).
Journal
Azure Data Explorer journal (metadata operations).
Query
Azure Data Explorer query execution summary.
SucceededIngestion
Succeeded ingestion operations logs provide information about successfully completed ingest operations. Logs include data source details that together withFailed ingestion operationslogs can be used for tracking the process of ingestion of each data source. Ingestion logs are supported for queued ingestion to the ingestion endpoint using SDKs, data connections, and connectors.
