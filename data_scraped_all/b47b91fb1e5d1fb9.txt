Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)is the authorization system you use to manage access to Azure resources. To determine what resources users, groups, service principals, or managed identities have access to, you list their role assignments. This article describes how to list role assignments using the Azure portal.
Note
If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who usesAzure Lighthouse, role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here. Similarly, users in the service provider tenant won't see role assignments for users in a customer's tenant, regardless of the role they've been assigned.

You can have up to4000role assignments in each subscription.

If you are getting close to the maximum number and you try to add more role assignments, you'll see a warning in theAdd role assignmentpane. For ways that you can reduce the number of role assignments, seeTroubleshoot Azure RBAC limits.

Download role assignments
You can download role assignments at a scope in CSV or JSON formats. This can be helpful if you need to inspect the list in a spreadsheet or take an inventory when migrating a subscription.
When you download role assignments, you should keep in mind the following criteria:
If you don't have permissions to read the directory, such as the Directory Readers role, the DisplayName, SignInName, and ObjectType columns will be blank.
