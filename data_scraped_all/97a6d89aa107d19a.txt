APPLIES TO: Premium v2
This article guides you through the requirements to inject your Azure API Management Premium v2 (preview) instance in a virtual network.
Note
The Premium v2 tier is currently in limited preview. To sign up, fillthis form.
Note
To inject a classic Developer or Premium tier instance in a virtual network, the requirements and configuration are different.Learn more.
When an API Management Premium v2 instance is injected in a virtual network:
The API Management gateway endpoint is accessible through the virtual network at a private IP address.
API Management can make outbound requests to API backends that are isolated in the network or any peered network, as long as network connectivity is properly configured.
This configuration is recommended for scenarios where you want to isolate network traffic to both the API Management instance and the backend APIs.

If you want to enablepublicinbound access to an API Management instance in the Standard v2 or Premium v2 tier, but limit outbound access to network-isolated backends, seeIntegrate with a virtual network for outbound connections.
Important
Virtual network injection described in this article is available only for API Management instances in the Premium v2 tier (preview). For networking options in the different tiers, seeUse a virtual network with Azure API Management.
Currently, you can inject a Premium v2 instance into a virtual network only when the instance iscreated. You can't inject an existing Premium v2 instance into a virtual network. However, you can update the subnet settings for injection after the instance is created.
Currently, you can't switch between virtual network injection and virtual network integration for a Premium v2 instance.
Prerequisites
An Azure API Management instance in thePremium v2pricing tier.
A virtual network where your client apps and your API Management backend APIs are hosted. See the following sections for requirements and recommendations for the virtual network and subnet used for the API Management instance.
Network location
The virtual network must be in the same region and Azure subscription as the API Management instance.
Dedicated subnet
The subnet used for virtual network injection can only be used by a single API Management instance. It can't be shared with another Azure resource.
Subnet size
Minimum: /27 (32 addresses)
Recommended: /24 (256 addresses) - to accommodate scaling of API Management instance
Network security group
A network security group must be associated with the subnet. No specific rules are required. To set up a network security group, seeCreate a network security group.
Subnet delegation
The subnet needs to be delegated to theMicrosoft.Web/hostingEnvironmentsservice.

Note
You might need to register theMicrosoft.Web/hostingEnvironmentsresource provider in the subscription so that you can delegate the subnet to the service.
Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments
For more information about configuring subnet delegation, seeAdd or remove a subnet delegation.
addressPrefix property
Virtual network injection in the Premium v2 tier requires that theaddressPrefixsubnet property is set to a valid CIDR block.
addressPrefix
If you configure the subnet using the Azure portal, the subnet sets anaddressPrefixes(plural) property consisting of a list of address prefixes. However, API Management requires a single CIDR block as the value of theaddressPrefixproperty.
addressPrefixes
addressPrefix
To create or update a subnet withaddressPrefix, use a tool such as Azure PowerShell, an Azure Resource Manager template, or theREST API. For example, update a subnet using theSet-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfigAzure PowerShell cmdlet:
addressPrefix
# Set values for the variables that are appropriate for your environment.

$resourceGroupName = "MyResourceGroup"
$virtualNetworkName = "MyVirtualNetwork"
$subnetName = "ApimSubnet"
$addressPrefix = "10.0.3.0/24"


$virtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $virtualNetworkName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName

Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork -AddressPrefix $addressPrefix

$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
# Set values for the variables that are appropriate for your environment.

$resourceGroupName = "MyResourceGroup"
$virtualNetworkName = "MyVirtualNetwork"
$subnetName = "ApimSubnet"
$addressPrefix = "10.0.3.0/24"


$virtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $virtualNetworkName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName

Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork -AddressPrefix $addressPrefix

$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
Permissions
You must have at least the following role-based access control permissions on the subnet or at a higher level to configure virtual network injection:
Inject API Management in a virtual network
When youcreatea Premium v2 instance using the Azure portal, you can optionally configure settings for virtual network injection.
In theCreate API Management servicewizard, select theNetworkingtab.
InConnectivity type, selectVirtual network.
InType, selectVirtual Network injection.
InConfigure virtual networks, select the virtual network and the delegated subnet that you want to inject.
Complete the wizard to create the API Management instance.
DNS settings for access to private IP address
When a Premium v2 API Management instance is injected in a virtual network, you have to manage your own DNS to enable inbound access to API Management.
While you have the option to use your own custom DNS server, we recommend:
Configure an AzureDNS private zone.
Link the Azure DNS private zone to the virtual network.
Learn how toset up a private zone in Azure DNS.
Endpoint access on default hostname
When you create an API Management instance in the Premium v2 tier, the following endpoint is assigned a default hostname:
Gateway- example:contoso-apim.azure-api.net
contoso-apim.azure-api.net
Configure DNS record
Create an A record in your DNS server to access the API Management instance from within your virtual network. Map the endpoint record to the private VIP address of your API Management instance.
For testing purposes, you might update the hosts file on a virtual machine in a subnet connected to the virtual network in which API Management is deployed. Assuming the private virtual IP address for your API Management instance is 10.1.0.5, you can map the hosts file as shown in the following example. The hosts mapping file is at%SystemDrive%\drivers\etc\hosts(Windows) or/etc/hosts(Linux, macOS). For example:
%SystemDrive%\drivers\etc\hosts
/etc/hosts
contoso-apim.portal.azure-api.net
