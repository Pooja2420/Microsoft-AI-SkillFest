After youinstall the VMware HCX add-on, configure the on-premises VMware HCX Connector for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
In this article, learn how to:
Pair your on-premises VMware HCX Connector with your Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager
Configure the network profile, compute profile, and service mesh
Check the appliance status and validate that migration is possible
After you complete these steps, you'll have a production-ready environment for creating virtual machines (VMs) and migration.
Prerequisites

Add a site pairing
In your data center, connect or pair the VMware HCX Cloud Manager in Azure VMware Solution with the VMware HCX Connector.
Important
According to theAzure VMware Solution limits, a single HCX manager system can have a maximum of 25 site pairs and 10 service meshes, including inbound and outbound site pairings.
Sign in to your on-premises vCenter Server, and underHome, selectHCX.

Enter the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager URL or IP address that you noted earlierhttps://x.x.x.9and the credentials for a user with the CloudAdmin role in your private cloud. Then selectConnect.NoteTo successfully establish a site pair:Your VMware HCX Connector must be able to route to your HCX Cloud Manager IP over port 443.A service account from your external identity source, such as Active Directory, is recommended for site pairing connections. For more information about setting up separate accounts for connected services, seeAccess and identity architecture.A screen displays the connection (pairing) between your VMware HCX Cloud Manager in Azure VMware Solution and your on-premises VMware HCX Connector.

Create network profiles
VMware HCX Connector deploys a subset of virtual appliances (automated) that require multiple IP segments. Create your network profiles using the IP segments identified during theplanning phase. Create four network profiles:
Management
vMotion
Replication
Uplink
Note
For Azure VMware Solution connected via VPN, set Uplink Network Profile MTU's to 1350 to account for IPsec overhead.
Azure VMware Solution defaults to 1500 MTU, which is sufficient for most ExpressRoute implementations.If your ExpressRoute provider does not support jumbo frames, you may need to lower the MTU in ExpressRoute setups as well.Adjust MTU settings on both HCX Connector (on-premises) and HCX Cloud Manager (Azure VMware Solution) network profiles.

Create a service mesh
Important
Make sure port UDP 4500 is open between your on-premises VMware HCX Connector 'uplink' network profile addresses and the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud 'uplink' network profile addresses. (UDP 500 was required in legacy versions of HCX. Seehttps://ports.vmware.comfor the latest information.)

The HCX interconnect tunnel status should displayUPin green. Now you're ready to migrate and protect Azure VMware Solution VMs using VMware HCX. Azure VMware Solution supports workload migrations with or without a network extension that allow you to migrate workloads in your vSphere environment, create networks on-premises, and deploy VMs onto those networks. For more information, see theVMware HCX Documentation.
