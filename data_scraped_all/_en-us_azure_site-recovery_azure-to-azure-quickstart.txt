TheAzure Site Recoveryservice contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by keeping your business applications online during planned and unplanned outages. Site Recovery manages and orchestrates disaster recovery of on-premises machines and Azure virtual machines (VM), including replication, failover, and recovery.
Azure Site Recovery has an option ofHigh Churn, enabling you to configure disaster recovery for Azure VMs having data churn up to 100 MB/s. This helps you to enable disaster recovery for more IO intensive workloads.Learn more.
This quickstart describes how to set up disaster recovery for an Azure VM by replicating it to a secondary Azure region. In general, default settings are used to enable replication.Learn more.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure subscription and a VM.
If you don't have an Azure account with an active subscription, you cancreate an account for free.
A VM with a minimum 1 GB of RAM is recommended.Learn moreabout how to create a VM.
Sign in to Azure
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Enable replication for the Azure VM
The following steps enable VM replication to a secondary location.
On the Azure portal, fromHome>Virtual machinesmenu, select a VM to replicate.
On the Azure portal, fromHome>Virtual machinesmenu, select a VM to replicate.
InOperations, selectDisaster recovery.
InOperations, selectDisaster recovery.
FromBasics>Target region, select the target region.
FromBasics>Target region, select the target region.
To view the replication settings, selectReview + Start replication. If you need to change any defaults, selectAdvanced settings.NoteAzure Site Recovery has aHigh Churnoption that you can choose to protect VMs with high data change rate. With this, you can use aPremium Block Blobtype of storage account. By default, theNormal Churnoption is selected. For more information, seeAzure VM Disaster Recovery - High Churn Support.

To start the job that enables VM replication, selectStart replication.
To start the job that enables VM replication, selectStart replication.

Verify settings
After the replication job is complete, you can check the replication status, modify replication settings, and test the deployment.
On the Azure portal menu, selectVirtual machinesand select the VM that you replicated.

Clean up resources
To stop replication of the VM in the primary region, you must disable replication:
The source replication settings are cleaned up automatically.
The Site Recovery extension installed on the VM during replication isn't removed.
Site Recovery billing for the VM stops.
To disable replication, perform these steps:
On the Azure portal menu, selectVirtual machinesand select the VM that you replicated.
