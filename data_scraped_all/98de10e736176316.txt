When using self-hosted agents, be sure that Docker is installed on the agent's host, and the Docker engine/daemon is running with elevated privileges.
To build the image, Docker must be installed on the agent's host and the Docker engine/daemon must be running with elevated privileges.  Use the following steps to create your pipeline using the YAML pipeline editor.
Go to your collection and create a project.
In your project, selectPipelines.
SelectCreate Pipeline.
SelectGitHub Enterprise Serveras the location for your source code.
If you haven't already, authorize Azure Pipelines to connect to your GitHub Enterprise Server account.SelectConnect to GitHub Enterprise Server.Enter your account details, and then selectVerify and save.
SelectConnect to GitHub Enterprise Server.
Enter your account details, and then selectVerify and save.
Select your repository.
If you're redirected to GitHub to install the Azure Pipelines app, selectApprove and install.
To configure your pipeline, select theBuild a Docker imagetemplate.
In the YAML pipeline editor, replace the contents of the YAML file with the following code. Replace the pool name with the name of the pool that contains your self-hosted agent with Docker capability.

For more information about building Docker images, see theDocker taskused by this sample application. You can also directly invoke Docker commands using acommand line task.
The container images are built and stored on the agent.  You can push your image to Google Container Registry, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry.  For more information, seePush an image to Docker Hub or Google Container RegistryorPush an image to Azure Container Registry.
Clean up resources
If you don't plan to continue using this application, delete your pipeline and code repository.
FAQ
What agents can I use to build container images?
You can build Linux container images using Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agents or Linux platform-based self-hosted agents.
You can build Linux container images using Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agents or Linux platform-based self-hosted agents.
You can build Windows container images using Microsoft-hosted Windows agents or Windows platform based self-hosted agents. All Microsoft-hosted Windows platform-based agents are shipped with the Moby engine and client needed for Docker builds.
You can build Windows container images using Microsoft-hosted Windows agents or Windows platform based self-hosted agents. All Microsoft-hosted Windows platform-based agents are shipped with the Moby engine and client needed for Docker builds.
You currently can't use Microsoft-hosted macOS agents to build container images because the Moby engine needed for building the images isn't preinstalled on these agents.
You currently can't use Microsoft-hosted macOS agents to build container images because the Moby engine needed for building the images isn't preinstalled on these agents.
For more information, see theWindows and Linux agent options available with Microsoft-hosted agents.
What precached Docker images are available on hosted agents?
To avoid spending long intervals pulling Docker images for every job from the container registry, some commonly used images are precached on Microsoft-hosted agents.
How do I set the BuildKit variable for my Docker builds?
BuildKitintroduces build improvements around performance, storage management, feature functionality, and security. BuildKit currently isn't supported on Windows hosts.
To enable Docker builds using BuildKit, set theDOCKER_BUILDKITvariable.
trigger:
- main
   
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
   

variables:
  imageName: 'pipelines-javascript-docker'
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
    
steps:
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build an image
  inputs:
    repository: $(imageName)
    command: build
    Dockerfile: app/Dockerfile
trigger:
- main
   
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
   

variables:
  imageName: 'pipelines-javascript-docker'
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
    
steps:
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build an image
  inputs:
    repository: $(imageName)
    command: build
    Dockerfile: app/Dockerfile
How can I use a self-hosted agent?
Docker must be installed and the engine/daemon running on the agent's host.   If Docker isn't installed on the agent's host, you can add theDocker installer taskto your pipeline.  You must add theDocker Installer Taskbefore theDocker Task.
How can I create a script-based Docker build instead of using the Docker task?
You can use thebuildcommand or any other Docker command.
build
docker build -f Dockerfile -t foobar.azurecr.io/hello:world .
docker build -f Dockerfile -t foobar.azurecr.io/hello:world .
This command creates an image equivalent to one built with the Docker task. Internally, the Docker task calls the Docker binary on a script and stitches together a few more commands to provide a few more benefits. Learn more aboutDocker task.
Can I reuse layer caching during builds on Azure Pipelines?
If you're using Microsoft-hosted agents, every job is dispatched to a newly provisioned virtual machine, based on the image generated fromazure-pipelines-image-generationrepositorytemplates. These virtual machines are cleaned up after the job completes. This ephemeral lifespan prevents reusing these virtual machines for subsequent jobs and the reuse of cached Docker layers. As a workaround, you can set up a multi-stage build that produces two images and pushes them to an image registry at an early stage. You can then tell Docker to use these images as a cache source with the--cache-fromargument.
--cache-from
If you're using self-hosted agents, you can cache Docker layers without any workarounds because the ephemeral lifespan problem doesn't apply to these agents.
How do I build Linux container images for architectures other than x64?
When you use Microsoft-hosted Linux agents, you create Linux container images for the x64 architecture. To create images for other architectures, such as x86 or ARM processor, you can use a machine emulator such asQEMU.
The following steps show how to create an ARM processor container image by using QEMU:
Author your Dockerfile with a base image that matches the target architecture:FROM arm64v8/alpine:latest
Author your Dockerfile with a base image that matches the target architecture:
FROM arm64v8/alpine:latest
FROM arm64v8/alpine:latest
Run the following script in your job before you build the image:# register QEMU binary - this can be done by running the following image
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
# build your image
Run the following script in your job before you build the image:
# register QEMU binary - this can be done by running the following image
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
# build your image
# register QEMU binary - this can be done by running the following image
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
# build your image
For more information, seeqemu-user-staticon GitHub.
How do I run tests and publish test results for containerized applications?
For different options on testing containerized applications and publishing the resulting test results, seePublish Test Results task.
Next steps
After you build your container image, push the image to Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, or Google Container registry. To learn how to push an image to a container registry, continue to either of the following articles:
