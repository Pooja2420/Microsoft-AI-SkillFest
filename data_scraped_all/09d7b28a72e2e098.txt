Azure Network Watcher provides a suite of tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for Azure IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) resources. Network Watcher enables you to monitor and repair the network health of IaaS products like virtual machines (VMs), virtual networks (VNets), application gateways, load balancers, etc. Network Watcher isn't designed or intended for PaaS monitoring or Web analytics.
Network Watcher consists of three major sets of tools and capabilities:
Monitoring
Network diagnostic tools
Traffic

Note
When you create or update a virtual network in your subscription, Network Watcher is automatically enabled in your virtual network's region. There's no impact on your resources or associated charge for automatically enabling Network Watcher. You must manually enable Network Watcher if you previously chose to opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement. For more information, seeEnable or disable Network Watcher.
Monitoring
Network Watcher offers two monitoring tools that help you view and monitor resources:
Topology
Connection monitor
Topology
Topologyprovides a visualization of the entire network for understanding network configuration. It provides an interactive interface to view resources and their relationships in Azure spanning across multiple subscriptions, resource groups, and locations. For more information, seeView topology.
Connection monitor
Connection monitorprovides end-to-end connection monitoring for Azure and hybrid endpoints. It helps you understand network performance between various endpoints in your network infrastructure. For more information, seeConnection monitor overviewandMonitor network communication between two virtual machines.
Network diagnostic tools
Network Watcher offers seven network diagnostic tools that help troubleshoot and diagnose network issues:
IP flow verify
NSG diagnostics
Next hop
Effective security rules
Connection troubleshoot
Packet capture
VPN troubleshoot
IP flow verify
IP flow verifyallows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine level. It checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address). It also tells you which security rule allowed or denied the traffic. For more information, seeIP flow verify overviewandDiagnose a virtual machine network traffic filter problem.
NSG diagnostics
NSG diagnosticsallows you to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine, virtual machine scale set, or application gateway level. It checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from an IP address, IP prefix, or a service tag. It tells you which security rule allowed or denied the traffic. It also allows you to add a new security rule with a higher priority to allow or deny the traffic. For more information, seeNSG diagnostics overviewandDiagnose network security rules.
Next hop
Next hopallows you to detect routing issues. It checks if traffic is routed correctly to the intended destination. It provides you with information about the Next hop type, IP address, and Route table ID for a specific destination IP address. For more information, seeNext hop overviewandDiagnose a virtual machine network routing problem.
Effective security rules
Effective security rulesallows you to view the effective security rules applied to a network interface. It shows you all security rules applied to the network interface, the subnet the network interface is in, and the aggregate of both. For more information, seeEffective security rules overviewandView details of a security rule.
Connection troubleshoot
Connection troubleshootenables you to test a connection between a virtual machine, a virtual machine scale set, an application gateway, or a Bastion host and a virtual machine, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using theconnection monitorcapability, but tests the connection at a point in time instead of monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does. For more information, seeConnection troubleshoot overviewandTroubleshoot outbound connections with Azure Network Watcher.
Packet capture
Packet captureallows you to remotely create packet capture sessions to track traffic to and from a virtual machine (VM) or a virtual machine scale set. For more information, seePacket capture overviewandManage packet captures.
VPN troubleshoot
VPN troubleshootenables you to troubleshoot virtual network gateways and their connections. For more information, seeVPN troubleshoot overviewandDiagnose a communication problem between networks.
Traffic
Network Watcher offers two traffic tools that help you log and visualize network traffic:
Flow logs
Traffic analytics
Flow logs
Flow logsallows you to log information about your Azure IP traffic and stores the data in Azure storage. You can log IP traffic flowing through a network security group or Azure virtual network. For more information, see:
Network security group flow logsandManage network security group flow logs.
Virtual network flow logsandManage virtual network flow logs.
Important
On September 30, 2027, network security group (NSG) flow logs will be retired. As part of this retirement, you'll no longer be able to create new NSG flow logs starting June 30, 2025. We recommendmigratingtovirtual network flow logs, which overcome the limitations of NSG flow logs. After the retirement date, traffic analytics enabled with NSG flow logs will no longer be supported, and existing NSG flow logs resources in your subscriptions will be deleted. However, NSG flow logs records won't be deleted and will continue to follow their respective retention policies. For more information, see theofficial announcement.
Traffic analytics
Traffic analyticsprovides rich visualizations of flow logs data. For more information about traffic analytics, seetraffic analyticsandManage traffic analytics using Azure Policy.

Usage + quotas
TheUsage + quotascapability of Network Watcher provides a summary of your deployed network resources within a subscription and region, including current usage and corresponding limits for each resource. For more information, seeNetworking limitsto learn about the limits for each Azure network resource per region per subscription. This information is helpful when planning future resource deployments as you can't create more resources if you reach their limits within the subscription or region.
