Using Azure Firewall Manager, you can create secured virtual hubs to secure your cloud network traffic destined to private IP addresses, Azure PaaS, and the Internet. Traffic routing to the firewall is automated, so there's no need to create user-defined routes (UDRs).
Firewall Manager also supports a hub virtual network architecture. For a comparison of the secured virtual hub and hub virtual network architecture types, seeWhat are the Azure Firewall Manager architecture options?
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Create the spoke virtual network
Create a secured virtual hub
Connect the hub and spoke virtual networks
Route traffic to your hub
Deploy the servers
Create a firewall policy and secure your hub
Test the firewall
Important
The procedure in this tutorial uses Azure Firewall Manager to create a new Azure Virtual WAN secured hub.
You can use Firewall Manager to upgrade an existing hub, but you can't configure AzureAvailability Zonesfor Azure Firewall.
It's also possible to convert an existing hub to a secured hub using the Azure portal, as described inConfigure Azure Firewall in a Virtual WAN hub. But like Azure Firewall Manager, you can't configureAvailability Zones.
To upgrade an existing hub and specify Availability Zones for Azure Firewall (recommended), you must follow the upgrade procedure inTutorial: Secure your virtual hub using Azure PowerShell.

Prerequisites
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create afree accountbefore you begin.
Create a hub and spoke architecture
First, create spoke virtual networks where you can place your servers.
Create two spoke virtual networks and subnets
The two virtual networks each have a workload server in them and are protected by the firewall.
From the Azure portal home page, selectCreate a resource.

Select the desired combination ofAvailability Zones.ImportantA Virtual WAN is a collection of hubs and services made available inside the hub. You can deploy as many Virtual WANs as you need. In a Virtual WAN hub, there are multiple services like VPN, ExpressRoute, and so on. Each of these services is automatically deployed across Availability Zones except Azure Firewall, if the region supports Availability Zones. To align with Azure Virtual WAN resiliency, you should select all available Availability Zones.

Test the firewall
To test the firewall rules, connect a remote desktop using the firewall public IP address, which is NATed toSrv-Workload-01. From there, use a browser to test the application rule and connect a remote desktop toSrv-Workload-02to test the network rule.
Test the application rule
Now, test the firewall rules to confirm that it works as expected.
Connect a remote desktop to firewall public IP address, and sign in.
Connect a remote desktop to firewall public IP address, and sign in.
Open Internet Explorer and browse tohttps://www.microsoft.com.

So now you verified that the firewall application rule is working:
You can browse to the one allowed FQDN, but not to any others.
Test the network rule
Now test the network rule.
From Srv-Workload-01, open a remote desktop to the Srv-Workload-02 private IP address.A remote desktop should connect to Srv-Workload-02.
From Srv-Workload-01, open a remote desktop to the Srv-Workload-02 private IP address.
A remote desktop should connect to Srv-Workload-02.
So now you verified that the firewall network rule is working:
You can connect a remote desktop to a server located in another virtual network.
Clean up resources
When youâre done testing your firewall resources, delete thefw-manager-rgresource group to delete all firewall-related resources.
