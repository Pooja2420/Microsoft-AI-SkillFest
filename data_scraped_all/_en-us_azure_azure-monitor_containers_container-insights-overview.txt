Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheusand Container Insights work together for complete monitoring of your Kubernetes environment. This article describes both features and the data they collect.
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheusis a fully managed service based on thePrometheusproject from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It allows you to collect and analyze metrics from yourAzure Kubernetes clustersorAzure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clustersat scale and analyze them using prebuilt dashboards inGrafana.
Container Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects and analyzes container logs fromAzure Kubernetes clustersorAzure Arc-enabled Kubernetesclusters and their components.  You can analyze the collected data for the different components in your cluster with a collection ofviewsand prebuiltworkbooks.
Important
Container Insights collects metric data from your cluster in addition to logs. This functionality is replaced byAzure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. You can analyze that data using built-in dashboards inManaged Grafanaand alert on them usingprebuilt Prometheus alert rules.
You can continue to have Container Insights collect metric data so you can use the Container Insights monitoring experience. Or you can save cost by disabling this collection and using Grafana for metric analysis. SeeConfigure data collection in Container Insights using data collection rulefor configuration options.
Data collected
Container Insights sends data to aLog Analytics workspacewhere you can analyze it using different features of Azure Monitor. Managed Prometheus sends data to anAzure Monitor workspace, allowing Managed Grafana to access it. SeeMonitoring datafor further details on this data.

Supported configurations
Container Insights supports the following environments:

Note
Container Insights supports ARM64 nodes on AKS. SeeCluster requirementsfor the details of Azure Arc-enabled clusters that support ARM64 nodes.
Container Insights support for Windows Server 2022 operating system is in public preview.
Security
Container Insights supports FIPS enabled Linux and Windows node pools starting with Agent version 3.1.17 (Linux)  & Win-3.1.17 (Windows).
Starting with Agent version 3.1.17 (Linux) and Win-3.1.17 (Windows), Container Insights agents images (both Linux and Windows) are signed and  for Windows agent,  binaries inside the container are signed as well
Access Container Insights
Access Container Insights in the Azure portal fromContainersin theMonitormenu or directly from the selected AKS cluster by selectingInsights. The Azure Monitor menu gives you the global perspective of all the containers that are deployed and monitored. This information allows you to search and filter across your subscriptions and resource groups. You can then drill into Container Insights from the selected container. Access Container Insights for a particular cluster from its page in the Azure portal.

Agent
Container Insights and Managed Prometheus rely on a containerizedAzure Monitor agentfor Linux. This specialized agent collects performance and event data from all nodes in the cluster. The agent is deployed and registered with the specified workspaces during deployment. When you enable Container Insights on a cluster, aData collection rule (DCR)is created. This DCR, namedMSCI-<cluster-region>-<cluster-name>, contains the definition of data that the Azure Monitor agent should collect.
MSCI-<cluster-region>-<cluster-name>
Since March 1, 2023 Container Insights uses a Semver compliant agent version. The agent version ismcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/ciprod:3.1.4or later. When a new version of the agent is released, it's automatically upgraded on your managed Kubernetes clusters that are hosted on AKS. To track which versions are released, seeAgent release announcements.
Log Analytics agent
When Container Insights doesn't use managed identity authentication, it relies on a containerizedLog Analytics agent for Linux. The agent version ismicrosoft/oms:ciprod04202018or later. When a new version of the agent is released, it's automatically upgraded on your managed Kubernetes clusters that are hosted on AKS. To track which versions are released, seeAgent release announcements.
With the general availability of Windows Server support for AKS, an AKS cluster with Windows Server nodes has a preview agent installed as a daemon set pod on each individual Windows Server node to collect logs and forward them to Log Analytics. For performance metrics, a Linux node is automatically deployed in the cluster as part of the standard deployment collects and forwards the data to Azure Monitor for all Windows nodes in the cluster.
Frequently asked questions
This section provides answers to common questions.
Is there support for collecting Kubernetes audit logs for ARO clusters?No. Container Insights don't support collection of Kubernetes audit logs.
Does Container Insights support pod sandboxing?Yes, Container Insights supports pod sandboxing through support for Kata Containers. SeePod Sandboxing (preview) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Is it possible for a single AKS cluster to use multiple Log Analytics workspaces in Container Insights?Yes. Container Insights supports segregating logs accross multiple Log Analytics Workspaces. SeeMultitenant managed logging in Container insights (Preview).
