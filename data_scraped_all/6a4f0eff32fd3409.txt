Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cloud-based Azure AI service that enables you to build intelligent document processing solutions. Document Intelligence APIs analyze images, PDFs, and other document files to extract and detect various content, layout, style, and semantic elements.
Custom classification models are deep-learning-model types that combine layout and language features to accurately detect and identify documents you process within your application. Custom classification models perform classification of an input file one page at a time to identify the documents within and can also identify multiple documents or multiple instances of a single document within an input file.
Model capabilities
Note
Custom classification v4.02024-11-30(GA) models support incremental training. You can add new samples to existing classes or add new classes by referencing an existing classifier.
2024-11-30
Custom classification v3.12023-07-31(GA) model doesn't support model copy. To use the model copy feature, train the model using the latest v4.0 (GA) model.
2023-07-31
Custom classification models can analyze a single- or multi-file documents to identify if any of the trained document types are contained within an input file. Here are the currently supported scenarios:
A single file containing one document type, such as a loan application form.
A single file containing one document type, such as a loan application form.
A single file containing multiple document types. For instance, a loan application package that contains a loan application form, payslip, and bank statement.

A single file containing multiple instances of the same document. For instance, a collection of scanned invoices.

The model classifies each page of the input document, unless specified, to one of the classes in the labeled dataset. You can specify the page numbers to analyze in the input document as well. To set the threshold for your application, use the confidence score from the response.
Incremental training
With custom models, you need to maintain access to the training dataset to update your classifier with new samples for an existing class, or add new classes. Classifier models now support incremental training where you can reference an existing classifier and append new samples for an existing class or add new classes with samples. Incremental training enables scenarios where data retention is a challenge and the classifier needs to be updated to align with changing business needs. Incremental training is supported with models trained with API versionv4.0 2024-11-30 (GA).
v4.0 2024-11-30 (GA)
Important
Incremental training is only supported with models trained with the same API version. If you're trying to extend a model, use the API version the original model was trained with to extend the model. Incremental training is only supported with API versionv4.0 2024-11-30 (GA)or later.
Incremental training requires that you provide the original model ID as thebaseClassifierId. Seeincremental trainingto learn more about how to use incremental training.
baseClassifierId
Office document type support
You can now train classifiers to recognize document types in various formats including PDF, images, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. When assembling your training dataset, you can add documents of any of the supported types. The classifier doesn't require you to explicitly label specific types. As a best practice, ensure your training dataset has at least one sample of each format to improve the overall accuracy of the model.
Compare custom classification and composed models
A custom classification model can replacea composed modelin some scenarios but there are a few differences to be aware of:
Language support
Classification models currently only support English language documents.
Classification models can now be trained on documents of different languages. Seesupported languagesfor a complete list.

Document splitting
When you have more than one document in a file, the classifier can identify the different document types contained within the input file. The classifier response contains the page ranges for each of the identified document types contained within a file. This response can include multiple instances of the same document type.
Theanalyzeoperation now includes asplitModeproperty that gives you granular control over the splitting behavior.
analyze
splitMode
To treat the entire input file as a single document for classification set the splitMode tonone. When you do so, the service returns just one class for the entire input file.
none
To classify each page of the input file, set the splitMode toperPage. The service attempts to classify each page as an individual document.
perPage
Set the splitMode toautoand the service identifies the documents and associated page ranges.
auto
Best practices
Custom classification models require a minimum of five samples per class to train. If the classes are similar, adding extra training samples improves model accuracy.
The classifier attempts to assign each document to one of the classes, if you expect the model to see document types not in the classes that are part of the training dataset, you should plan to set a threshold on the classification score or add a few representative samples of the document types to an"other"class. Adding an"other"class ensures that unneeded documents don't affect your classifier quality.

Training a model
Custom classification models are supported by thev4.0 2024-11-30 (GA)API.Document Intelligence Studioprovides a no-code user interface to interactively train a custom classifier. Follow thehow to guideto get started.
When using the REST API, if you organize your documents by folders, you can use theazureBlobSourceproperty of the request to train a classification model.

Alternatively, if you have a flat list of files or only plan to use a few select files within each folder to train the model, you can use theazureBlobFileListSourceproperty to train the model. This step requires afile listinJSON Linesformat. For each class, add a new file with a list of files to be submitted for training.

Overwriting a model
Note
The v4.02024-11-30(GA) custom classification model supports overwriting a model in-place.
2024-11-30
You can now update the custom classification in-place. Directly overwriting the model would lose you the ability to compare model quality before deciding to replace the existing model. Model overwriting is allowed when theallowOverwriteproperty is explicitly specified in the request body. It's impossible to recover the overwritten, original model once this action is performed.
allowOverwrite
{
  "classifierId": "existingClassifierName",
  "allowOverwrite": true,  // Default=false
  ...
}
{
  "classifierId": "existingClassifierName",
  "allowOverwrite": true,  // Default=false
  ...
}
Copy a model
Note
The custom classification v4.02024-11-30(GA) model supports copying a model to and from any of the following regions:
2024-11-30
East US
West US2
West Europe
Use theREST APIorDocument Intelligence Studioto copy a model to another region.
