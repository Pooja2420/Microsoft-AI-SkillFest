Azure Private DNS zone resiliency

DNS private zones are resilient to regional outages because zone data is globally available. Resource records in a private zone are automatically replicated across regions.
Resiliency example
The following figure illustrates the availability of private zone data across multiple regions.

In this example:
The private zone azure.contoso.com is linked to VNets in three different regions. Autoregistration is enabled in two regions.
A temporary outage occurs in region A.
Regions B and C are still able to successfully query DNS names in the private zone, including names that are autoregistered from region A (ex: VM1).
Region B can add, edit, or delete records from the private DNS zone as needed.
Service interruption in region A doesn't affect name resolution in the other regions.
The example shown here doesn't illustrate a disaster recovery scenario, however the global nature of private zones also makes it possible to recreate VM1 in another VNet and assume its workload.
Note
Azure Private DNS is a zone-redundant service. For more information, seeAzure services with availability zone support.
