Azure infrastructure publishes Service health notifications into theAzure activity log. The notifications contain information about the resources under your subscription.Given that there could be large volume of information stored in the activity log, there's a separate user interface to make it easier to view and set up alerts on service health notifications.
Service health notifications can be informational or actionable, depending on the class.
For more information on the various classes of service health notifications, seeService health notifications properties.
