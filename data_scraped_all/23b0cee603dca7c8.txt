Searches a text pattern in multiple tables and columns.
Note
If you know the specific tables and columns you want to search, it's more performant to use theunionandwhereoperators. Thesearchoperator can be slow when searching across a large number of tables and columns.

Note
If both tabular data source (T) andTableSourcesare omitted, the search is carried over all unrestricted tables and views of the database in scope.
Search predicate syntax
TheSearchPredicateallows you to search for specific terms in all columns of a table. The operator that is applied to a search term depends on the presence and placement of a wildcard asterisk (*) in the term, as shown in the following table.
*
billg
has
*billg
hassuffix
billg*
hasprefix
*billg*
contains
bi*lg
matches regex
You can also restrict the search to a specific column, look for an exact match instead of a term match, or search by regular expression. The syntax for each of these cases is shown in the following table.
:
==
matches regex
Use boolean expressions to combine conditions and create more complex searches. For example,"error" and x==123would result in a search for records that have the termerrorin any columns and the value123in thexcolumn.
"error" and x==123
error
123
x
Search predicate syntax examples
where
search "err"
where * has "err"
search in (T1,T2,A*) "err"
union T1,T2,A* | where * has "err"

search col:"err"
where col has "err"
search col=="err"
where col=="err"
search "err*"
where * hasprefix "err"
search "*err"
where * hassuffix "err"
search "*err*"
where * contains "err"
search "Lab*PC"
where * matches regex @"\bLab.*PC\b"
search *
where 0==0
search col matches regex "..."
where col matches regex "..."
search kind=case_sensitive
search "abc" and ("def" or "hij")
where * has "abc" and (* has "def" or * has hij")
search "err" or (A>a and A<b)
where * has "err" or (A>a and A<b)
Remarks
Unlike thefind operator, thesearchoperator doesn't support the following syntax:
search
withsource=: The output always includes a column called$tableof typestringwhose value
is the table name from which each record was retrieved (or some system-generated name if the source
isn't a table but a composite expression).
withsource=
$table
string
project=,project-smart: The output schema is equivalent toproject-smartoutput schema.
project=
project-smart
project-smart
Examples
The example in this section shows how to use the syntax to help you get started.
The examples in this article use publicly available tables in thehelp cluster, such as theStormEventstable in theSamplesdatabase.

Global term search
Search for the term Green in all the tables of theContosoSalesdatabase.
The output finds records with the termGreenas a last name or a color in theCustomers,Products, andSalesTabletables.
Customers
Products
SalesTable
Run the query
search "Green"
search "Green"
Output
Conditional global term search
Search for records that contain the termGreenand one of either termsDeluxeorProsewarein theContosoSalesdatabase.
Run the query
search "Green" and ("Deluxe" or "Proseware")
search "Green" and ("Deluxe" or "Proseware")
Output
Search a specific table
Search for the termGreenonly in theCustomerstable.
Customers
Run the query
search in (Products) "Green"
search in (Products) "Green"
Output
Case-sensitive search
Search for records that match the case-sensitive term in theContosoSalesdatabase.
Run the query
search kind=case_sensitive "blue"
search kind=case_sensitive "blue"
Output
Search specific columns
Search for the termsAaronandHughes, in the "FirstName" and "LastName" columns respectively, in theContosoSalesdatabase.
Run the query
search FirstName:"Aaron" or LastName:"Hughes"
search FirstName:"Aaron" or LastName:"Hughes"
Output
Limit search by timestamp
Search for the termHughesin theContosoSalesdatabase, if the term appears in a record with a date greater than the given date in 'datetime'.
Run the query
search "Hughes" and DateKey > datetime('2009-01-01')
search "Hughes" and DateKey > datetime('2009-01-01')
Output
Performance Tips
search
search
search "billg" and ("steveb" or "satyan")
search "billg" | search "steveb" or "satyan"

search
search "billg" and "steveb"
search * | where * has "billg" and * has "steveb"
