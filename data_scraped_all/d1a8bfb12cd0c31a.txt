ALZ ‚ù§Ô∏è AVM - Azure Verified Modules for Platform Landing Zones (ALZ)
Based on continuous feedback from the community, we have adopted a more modular approach to deploying Azure Landing Zones with Terraform.
This new approach is based onAzure Verified Modules(AVM) and is designed to be more flexible.
Branding
With the move to using Azure Verified Modules, we have new branding!
We are using the following wording to describe the new offerings:
Azure Verified Modules for Platform Landing Zones (ALZ)
Why have we made this change?
We received feedback from our community that the following improvements were needed:
Customization
You asked us to be able to fully customize the configuration of each component.
Examples included defining a custom management group hierarchy, or setting specific settings (and names!) on resources.
This requirement was front and center in our minds when designing the new approach.
You can now fully customize the configuration of each component (including the resource names üòá).
Modularity
You didn‚Äôt like that the module contained a combination of components that you may not need, and that you had to deploy the entire module even if you only wanted to use a subset of the components.
You also asked that we make it easier for organizations to have different teams manage different components of the Azure Landing Zone.
You can now choose your own adventure and pick and choose only the components you need.
What is the new approach?
The new approach is based onAzure Verified Modulesand is designed to be more flexible.
Here is the list of modules that pertain to Azure Landing Zones and covers the scope of the original ALZ Terraform module:
ALZ core
ALZ management
Hub networking
Virtual network gateway
Virtual WAN
Private link DNS zones
Using these modules together, you can create a fully customized Azure Landing Zone.
How do I deploy?
For most customers, we recommend you use theAccelerator.
This uses all the modules above, but in a pre-defined configuration and opinionated approach.
There are still customization options available, but theAcceleratoris designed to get you up and running quickly - as a bonus it also includes CI/CD pipelines!
I‚Äôm an advanced user, how to I get started?
We recognize that this is a significant change, and we want to make it as easy as possible for you to get started.
We have created this documentation site to centralize the integration documentation for the new modular approach.
In here you will find guidance on how to use theALZ core pattern modulewith those listed above to build your very own Azure Landing Zone.
To proceed, you should be comfortable creating Terraform configurations and using Terraform modules.
If you are not, we recommend that you take a look at theAcceleratoras it offers a simplified experience.
Move on to thegetting startedsection to get started with the new approach.
