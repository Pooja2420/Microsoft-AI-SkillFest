In Azure Monitor,metricsare a series of measured values and counts that are collected and stored over time. Metrics can be standard (also calledplatform) or custom. The Azure platform provides standard metrics. These metrics reflect the health and usage statistics of your Azure resources.
In addition to standard metrics, your application emits extracustomperformance indicators or business-related metrics. Custom metrics can be emitted by any application or Azure resource and collected by usingAzure Monitor Insights, agents running on virtual machines, orOpenTelemetry.
Azure Monitor metrics explorer is a component of the Azure portal that helps you plot charts, visually correlate trends, and investigate spikes and dips in metrics values. You can use metrics explorer to investigate the health and utilization of your resources.
Watch the following video for an overview of creating and working with metrics charts in Azure Monitor metrics explorer.
Create a metric chart using PromQL
You can now create charts using Prometheus query language (PromQL) for metrics stored in an Azure Monitor workspace. For more information, seeMetrics explorer with PromQL (Preview).
Create a metric chart
You can open metrics explorer from theAzure Monitor overviewpage, or from theMonitoringsection of any resource. In the Azure portal, selectMetrics.

If you open metrics explorer from Azure Monitor, theSelect a scopepage opens. Set theSubscription,Resource, and regionLocationfields to the resource to explore. If you open metrics explorer for a specific resource, the scope is prepopulated with information about that resource.
Here's a summary of configuration tasks for creating a chart to analyze metrics:

Configure the time range
Thetime pickerlets you configure the time range for your metric chart to view data that's relevant to your monitoring scenario. By default, the chart shows the most recent 24 hours of metrics data.
Note
Most metrics in Azure are stored for 93 days. You can query no more than 30 days of data on any single chart. You canpanthe chart to view the full retention. The 30-day limitation doesn't apply tolog-based metrics.
Use the time picker to change theTime rangefor your data, such as the last 12 hours or the last 30 days.

In addition to changing the time range with the time picker, you can pan and zoom by using the controls in the chart area.
Interactive chart features
Pan across metrics data
To pan, select the left and right arrows at the edge of the chart. The arrow control moves the selected time range back and forward by one half of the chart's time span. If you're viewing the past 24 hours, selecting the left arrow causes the time range to shift to span a day and a half to 12 hours ago.

Zoom into metrics data
You can configure thetime granularityof the chart data to support zoom in and zoom out for the time range. Use thetime brushto investigate an interesting area of the chart like a spike or a dip in the data. Select an area on the chart and the chart zooms in to show more detail for the selected area based on your granularity settings. If the time grain is set toAutomatic, zooming selects a smaller time grain. The new time range applies to all charts in metrics explorer.

View multiple metric lines and charts
You can create charts that plot multiple metric lines or show multiple metric charts at the same time. This functionality allows you to:
Correlate related metrics on the same graph to see how one value relates to another.
Display metrics that use different units of measure in close proximity.
Visually aggregate and compare metrics from multiple resources.
Suppose you have five storage accounts and you want to know how much space they consume together. You can create a stacked area chart that shows the individual values and the sum of all the values at points in time.
After you create a chart, selectAdd metricto add another metric to the same chart.

Add multiple charts
Typically, your charts shouldn't mix metrics that use different units of measure. For example, avoid mixing one metric that uses milliseconds with another that uses kilobytes. Also avoid mixing metrics whose scales differ significantly. In these cases, consider using multiple charts instead.
To create another chart that uses a different metric, selectNew chart.
To create another chart that uses a different metric, selectNew chart.
To reorder or delete multiple charts, selectMore options(...), and then select theMove up,Move down, orDeleteaction.
To reorder or delete multiple charts, selectMore options(...), and then select theMove up,Move down, orDeleteaction.

Use different line colors
Chart lines are automatically assigned a color from a default palette. To change the color of a chart line, select the colored bar in the legend that corresponds to the line on the chart. Use thecolor pickerto select the line color.

Customized colors are preserved when you pin the chart to a dashboard. The following section shows how to pin a chart.
Configure aggregation
When you add a metric to a chart, metrics explorer applies a default aggregation. The default makes sense in basic scenarios, but you can use a different aggregation to gain more insights about the metric.
Before you use different aggregations on a chart, you should understand how metrics explorer handles them. Metrics are a series of measurements (or "metric values") that are captured over a time period. When you plot a chart, the values of the selected metric are separately aggregated over thetime granularity.
You select the size of the time grain by using the time picker in metrics explorer. If you don't explicitly select the time grain, metrics explorer uses the currently selected time range by default. After metrics explorer determines the time grain, the metric values that it captures during each time grain are aggregated on the chart, one data point per time grain.
Suppose a chart shows theServer response timemetric. It uses the average aggregation over the time span of the last 24 hours.

In this scenario, if you set the time granularity to 30 minutes, metrics explorer draws the chart from 48 aggregated data points. That is, it uses two data points per hour for 24 hours. The line chart connects 48 dots in the chart plot area. Each data point represents the average of all captured response times for server requests that occurred during each of the relevant 30-minute time periods. If you switch the time granularity to 15 minutes, you get 96 aggregated data points. That is, you get four data points per hour for 24 hours.
Metrics explorer has five aggregation types:
Sum: The sum of all values captured during the aggregation interval. The sum aggregation is sometimes called thetotalaggregation.
Sum: The sum of all values captured during the aggregation interval. The sum aggregation is sometimes called thetotalaggregation.
Count: The number of measurements captured during the aggregation interval.When the metric is always captured with the value of 1, the count aggregation is equal to the sum aggregation. This scenario is common when the metric tracks the count of distinct events and each measurement represents one event. The code emits a metric record every time a new request arrives.
Count: The number of measurements captured during the aggregation interval.

Average: The average of the metric values captured during the aggregation interval.

Min: The smallest value captured during the aggregation interval.

Max: The largest value captured during the aggregation interval.
Max: The largest value captured during the aggregation interval.

Metrics explorer hides the aggregations that are irrelevant and can't be used.
For more information about how metric aggregation works, seeAzure Monitor metrics aggregation and display explained.
Use dimension filters and splitting
Filtering and splitting are powerful diagnostic tools for metrics that have dimensions. You can implement these options to analyze which segments of the metric contribute to the overall metric value and identify possible outliers in the metric data. These features show how various metric segments or dimensions affect the overall value of the metric.
Filteringlets you choose which dimension values are included in the chart. You might want to show successful requests when you chart theserver response timemetric. You apply the filter on thesuccess of requestdimension.
Splittingcontrols whether the chart displays separate lines for each value of a dimension or aggregates the values into a single line. Splitting allows you to visualize how different segments of the metric compare with each other. You can see one line for an average CPU usage across all server instances, or you can see separate lines for each server.
Tip
To hide segments that are irrelevant for your scenario and to make your charts easier to read, use both filtering and splitting on the same dimension.
Add filters
You can apply filters to charts whose metrics have dimensions. Consider aTransaction countmetric that has aResponse typedimension. This dimension indicates whether the response from transactions succeeded or failed. If you filter on this dimension, metrics explorer displays a chart line for only successful or only failed transactions.
Above the chart, selectAdd filterto open thefilter picker.

Split metrics for multiple resources
When you plot a metric for multiple resources, you can chooseApply splittingto split by resource ID or resource group. The split allows you to compare a single metric across multiple resources or resource groups. The following chart shows the percentage CPU across nine virtual machines. When you split by resource ID, you see how percentage CPU differs by virtual machine.

For more examples that use filtering and splitting, seeMetric chart examples.
Lock the y-axis range
Locking the range of the value (y) axis becomes important in charts that show small fluctuations of large values. Consider how a drop in the volume of successful requests from 99.99 percent to 99.5 percent might represent a significant reduction in the quality of service. Noticing a small fluctuation in a numeric value would be difficult or even impossible if you're using the default chart settings. In this case, you could lock the lowest boundary of the chart to 99 percent to make a small drop more apparent.
Another example is a fluctuation in the available memory. In this scenario, the value technically never reaches 0. Fixing the range to a higher value might make drops in available memory easier to spot.
To control the y-axis range, browse to the advanced chart settings by selectingMore options(...) >Chart settings.

Modify the values in theY-axis rangesection, or selectAutoto revert to the default values.
Modify the values in theY-axis rangesection, or selectAutoto revert to the default values.

If you lock the boundaries of the y-axis for a chart that tracks count, sum, minimum, or maximum aggregations over a period of time, specify a fixed time granularity. Don't rely on the automatic defaults.
You choose a fixed time granularity because chart values change when the time granularity is automatically modified after a user resizes a browser window or changes screen resolution. The resulting change in time granularity affects the appearance of the chart, invalidating the selection of the y-axis range.
Set up alert rules
You can use your visualization criteria to create a metric-based alert rule. The new alert rule includes your chart's target resource, metric, splitting, and filter dimensions. You can modify these settings by using theCreate an alert rulepane.

Correlate metrics to logs
In metrics explorer, theDrill into Logsfeature helps you diagnose the root cause of anomalies in your metric chart. Drilling into logs allows you to correlate spikes in your metric chart to the following types of logs and queries:
Activity log: Provides insight into the operations on each Azure resource in the subscription from the outside (the management plane) and updates on Azure Service Health events. Use the activity log to determine theâ¯what,â¯who, andâ¯whenâ¯for any write operations (PUT,POST, orDELETE) taken on the resources in your subscription. There's a single activity log for each Azure subscription.
PUT
POST
DELETE
Diagnostic log: Provides insight into operations that you performed within an Azure resource (theâ¯data plane). Examples include getting a secret from a key vault or making a request to a database. The content of resource logs varies by the Azure service and resource type. You must enable logs for the resource.
Recommended logProvides scenario-based queries that you can use to investigate anomalies in metrics explorer.
