In this article, learn how to establish a VPN (IPsec IKEv1 and IKEv2) site-to-site tunnel terminating in the Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN hub. The hub contains the Azure VMware Solution ExpressRoute gateway and the site-to-site VPN gateway. It connects an on-premises VPN device with an Azure VMware Solution endpoint.

Prerequisites
You must have a public-facing IP address terminating on an on-premises VPN device.

Create a virtual hub
A virtual hub is a virtual network that is created and used by Azure Virtual WAN. It's the core of your Virtual WAN network in a region.  It can contain gateways for site-to-site and ExpressRoute.
Tip
You can alsocreate a gateway in an existing hub.
Go to the virtual WAN that you created. On the virtual WAN page left pane, under theConnectivity, selectHubs.

On theSite to sitetab, complete the following fields:SelectYesto create a Site-to-site VPN.AS Number: The AS Number field can't be edited.Gateway scale units: Select theGateway scale unitsvalue from the dropdown. The scale unit lets you pick the aggregate throughput of the VPN gateway being created in the virtual hub to connect sites to.If you pick 1 scale unit = 500 Mbps, it implies that two instances for redundancy will be created, each having a maximum throughput of 500 Mbps. For example, if you had five branches, each doing 10 Mbps at the branch, you'll need an aggregate of 50 Mbps at the head end. Planning for aggregate capacity of the Azure VPN gateway should be done after assessing the capacity needed to support the number of branches to the hub.Routing preference: Azure routing preference lets you choose how your traffic routes between Azure and the internet. You can choose to route traffic either via the Microsoft network, or via the ISP network (public internet). These options are also referred to as cold potato routing and hot potato routing, respectively.The public IP address in Virtual WAN is assigned by the service, based on the routing option selected. For more information about routing preference via Microsoft network or ISP, see theRouting preferencearticle.

SelectLinksto add information about the physical links at the branch. If you have a Virtual WAN partner CPE device, check with them to see if this information gets exchanged with Azure as a part of the branch information upload set up from their systems.Specifying link and provider names allow you to distinguish between any number of gateways that can eventually be created as part of the hub.BGPand autonomous system number (ASN) must be unique inside your organization. BGP ensures that both Azure VMware Solution and the on-premises servers advertise their routes across the tunnel. If disabled, the subnets that need to be advertised must be manually maintained. If subnets are missed, HCX fails to form the service mesh.ImportantBy default, Azure assigns a private IP address from the GatewaySubnet prefix range automatically as the Azure BGP IP address on the Azure VPN gateway. The custom Azure APIPA BGP address is needed when your on premises VPN devices use an APIPA address (169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254) as the BGP IP. Azure VPN Gateway will choose the custom APIPA address if the corresponding local network gateway resource (on-premises network) has an APIPA address as the BGP peer IP. If the local network gateway uses a regular IP address (not APIPA), Azure VPN Gateway will revert to the private IP address from the GatewaySubnet range.

(Optional) Create policy-based VPN site-to-site tunnels
Important
This is an optional step and applies only to policy-based VPNs.
Policy-based VPN setupsrequire on-premises and Azure VMware Solution networks to be specified, including the hub ranges.  These ranges specify the encryption domain of the policy-based VPN tunnel on-premises endpoint.  The Azure VMware Solution side only requires the policy-based traffic selector indicator to be enabled.

If you're deploying a firewall in the hub and it's the next hop, set thePropagate Default Routeoption toEnable.When enabled, the Virtual WAN hub propagates to a connection only if the hub already learned the default route when deploying a firewall in the hub or if another connected site forced tunneling enabled. The default route doesn't originate in the Virtual WAN hub.
