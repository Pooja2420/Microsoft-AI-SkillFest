Azure OpenAI Service supports Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), an authorization system for managing individual access to Azure resources. Using Azure RBAC, you assign different team members different levels of permissions based on their needs for a given project. For more information, see theAzure RBAC documentation.
Add role assignment to an Azure OpenAI resource
Azure RBAC can be assigned to an Azure OpenAI resource. To grant access to an Azure resource, you add a role assignment.
In theAzure portal, search forAzure OpenAI.
In theAzure portal, search forAzure OpenAI.
SelectAzure OpenAI, and navigate to your specific resource.NoteYou can also set up Azure RBAC for whole resource groups, subscriptions, or management groups. Do this by selecting the desired scope level and then navigating to the desired item. For example, selectingResource groupsand then navigating to a specific resource group.

Azure OpenAI roles
Cognitive Services OpenAI User
Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor
Cognitive Services Contributor
Cognitive Services Usages Reader
Note
Subscription levelOwnerandContributorroles are inherited and take priority over the custom Azure OpenAI roles applied at the Resource Group level.
This section covers common tasks that different accounts and combinations of accounts are able to perform for Azure OpenAI resources. To view the full list of availableActionsandDataActions, an individual role is granted from your Azure OpenAI resource goAccess control (IAM)>Roles> Under theDetailscolumn for the role you're interested in selectView. By default theActionsradial button is selected. You need to examine bothActionsandDataActionsto understand the full scope of capabilities assigned to a role.
Cognitive Services OpenAI User
If a user were granted role-based access to only this role for an Azure OpenAI resource, they would be able to perform the following common tasks:
â View the resource inAzure portalâ View the resource endpoint underKeys and Endpointâ Ability to view the resource and associated model deployments inAzure AI Foundry portal.â Ability to view what models are available for deployment inAzure AI Foundry portal.â Use the Chat, Completions, and DALL-E (preview) playground experiences to generate text and images with any models that have already been deployed to this Azure OpenAI resource.â Make inference API calls with Microsoft Entra ID.
A user with only this role assigned would be unable to:
â Create new Azure OpenAI resourcesâ View/Copy/Regenerate keys underKeys and Endpointâ Create new model deployments or edit existing model deploymentsâ Create/deploy custom fine-tuned modelsâ Upload datasets for fine-tuningâ View, query, filter Stored completions dataâ Access quotaâ Create customized content filtersâ Add a data source for the use your data feature
Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor
This role has all the permissions of Cognitive Services OpenAI User and is also able to perform additional tasks like:
â Create custom fine-tuned modelsâ Upload datasets for fine-tuningâ View, query, filter Stored completions dataâ Create new model deployments or edit existing model deployments[Added Fall 2023]â Add data sources to Azure OpenAI On Your Data.You must also have theCognitive Services Contributorrole as well.
A user with only this role assigned would be unable to:
â Create new Azure OpenAI resourcesâ View/Copy/Regenerate keys underKeys and Endpointâ Access quotaâ Create customized content filtersâ Add a data source for Azure OpenAI On Your Data
Cognitive Services Contributor
This role is typically granted access at the resource group level for a user in conjunction with additional roles. By itself this role would allow a user to perform the following tasks.
â Create new Azure OpenAI resources within the assigned resource group.â View resources in the assigned resource group in theAzure portal.â View the resource endpoint underKeys and Endpointâ View/Copy/Regenerate keys underKeys and Endpointâ Ability to view what models are available for deployment inAzure AI Foundry portalâ Use the Chat, Completions, and DALL-E (preview) playground experiences to generate text and images with any models that have already been deployed to this Azure OpenAI resourceâ Create customized content filtersâ Add data sources to Azure OpenAI On Your Data.You must also have theCognitive Services OpenAI Contributorrole as well.
â Create new model deployments or edit existing model deployments (via API)â Create custom fine-tuned models[Added Fall 2023]â Upload datasets for fine-tuning[Added Fall 2023]â Create new model deployments or edit existing model deployments (via Azure AI Foundry)[Added Fall 2023]â View, query, filter Stored completions data
A user with only this role assigned would be unable to:
â Access quotaâ Make inference API calls with Microsoft Entra ID.
Cognitive Services Usages Reader
Viewing quota requires theCognitive Services Usages Readerrole. This role provides the minimal access necessary to view quota usage across an Azure subscription.
This role can be found in the Azure portal underSubscriptions> *Access control (IAM)>Add role assignment> search forCognitive Services Usages Reader. The role must be applied at the subscription level, it does not exist at the resource level.
If you don't wish to use this role, the subscriptionReaderrole provides equivalent access, but it also grants read access beyond the scope of what is needed for viewing quota. Model deployment via theAzure AI Foundry portalis also partially dependent on the presence of this role.
This role provides little value by itself and is instead typically assigned in combination with one or more of the previously described roles.
All the capabilities of Cognitive Services OpenAI User plus the ability to:
â View quota allocations inAzure AI Foundry portal
All the capabilities of Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor plus the ability to:
â View quota allocations inAzure AI Foundry portal
All the capabilities of Cognitive Services Contributor plus the ability to:
â View & edit quota allocations inAzure AI Foundry portalâ Create new model deployments or edit existing model deployments (via Azure AI Foundry)
Summary
Common Issues
Unable to view Azure Cognitive Search option in Azure AI Foundry portal
Issue:
When selecting an existing Azure Cognitive Search resource the search indices don't load, and the loading wheel spins continuously. InAzure AI Foundry portal, go toPlayground Chat>Add your data (preview)under Assistant setup. SelectingAdd a data sourceopens a modal that allows you to add a data source through either Azure Cognitive Search or Blob Storage. Selecting the Azure Cognitive Search option and an existing Azure Cognitive Search resource should load the available Azure Cognitive Search indices to select from.
Root cause
To make a generic API call for listing Azure Cognitive Search services, the following call is made:
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices?api-version=2021-04-01-Preview
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices?api-version=2021-04-01-Preview
Replace {subscriptionId} with your actual subscription ID.
For this API call, you need asubscription-level scoperole. You can use theReaderrole for read-only access or theContributorrole for read-write access. If you only need access to Azure Cognitive Search services, you can use theAzure Cognitive Search Service ContributororAzure Cognitive Search Service Readerroles.
Solution options
Contact your subscription administrator or owner: Reach out to the person managing your Azure subscription and request the appropriate access. Explain your requirements and the specific role you need (for example, Reader, Contributor, Azure Cognitive Search Service Contributor, or Azure Cognitive Search Service Reader).

Explain your requirements and the specific role you need (for example, Reader, Contributor, Azure Cognitive Search Service Contributor, or Azure Cognitive Search Service Reader).
Request subscription-level or resource group-level access: If you need access to specific resources, ask the subscription owner to grant you access at the appropriate level (subscription or resource group). This enables you to perform the required tasks without having access to unrelated resources.

Use API keys for Azure Cognitive Search: If you only need to interact with the Azure Cognitive Search service, you can request the admin keys or query keys from the subscription owner. These keys allow you to make API calls directly to the search service without needing an Azure RBAC role. Keep in mind that using API keys willbypassthe Azure RBAC access control, so use them cautiously and follow security best practices.

Unable to upload files in Azure AI Foundry portal for on your data
Symptom:Unable to access storage for theon your datafeature using Azure AI Foundry.
Root cause:
Insufficient subscription-level access for the user attempting to access the blob storage inAzure AI Foundry portal. The user maynothave the necessary permissions to call the Azure Management API endpoint:https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}/listAccountSas?api-version=2022-09-01
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}/listAccountSas?api-version=2022-09-01
Public access to the blob storage is disabled by the owner of the Azure subscription for security reasons.
Permissions needed for the API call:**Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listAccountSas/action:**This permission allows the user to list the Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens for the specified storage account.
**Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listAccountSas/action:**
Possible reasons why the user maynothave permissions:
The user is assigned a limited role in the Azure subscription, which does not include the necessary permissions for the API call.
The user's role has been restricted by the subscription owner or administrator due to security concerns or organizational policies.
The user's role has been recently changed, and the new role does not grant the required permissions.
Solution options
Verify and update access rights: Ensure the user has the appropriate subscription-level access, including the necessary permissions for the API call (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listAccountSas/action). If required, request the subscription owner or administrator to grant the necessary access rights.
Request assistance from the owner or admin: If the solution above is not feasible, consider asking the subscription owner or administrator to upload the data files on your behalf. This approach can help import the data into Azure AI Foundry withoutuserrequiring subscription-level access or public access to the blob storage.
