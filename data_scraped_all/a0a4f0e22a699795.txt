The NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension for Windows installs NVIDIA GPU drivers on Windows N-series virtual machines (VMs). Depending on the VM family, the extension installs CUDA or GRID drivers. When you install NVIDIA drivers by using this extension, you accept and agree to the terms of theNVIDIA End-User License Agreement. During the installation process, the VM might reboot to complete the driver setup.
The instructions for manual installation of the drivers, and the list of current supported versions are available for review. For more information, seeInstall NVIDIA GPU drivers on N-series VMs running Windows.
The NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension can also be deployed on Linux N-series VMs. For more information, seeNVIDIA GPU Driver Extension for Linux.
Note
The GPU driver extensions do not automatically update the driver after the extension is installed. If you need to move to a newer driver version then either manually download and install the driver or remove and add the extension again.
Prerequisites
Confirm your virtual machine satisfies the prerequisites for using the NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension.
Operating system support
The NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension supports the following Windows versions:
Internet connection required
The NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension requires that the target VM is connected to the internet and has access.
Review the extension schema
The following JSON snippet shows the schema for the extension:
{
  "name": "<myExtensionName>",
  "type": "extensions",
  "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
  "location": "<location>",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', <myVM>)]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.HpcCompute",
    "type": "NvidiaGpuDriverWindows",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.4",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {
    }
  }
}
{
  "name": "<myExtensionName>",
  "type": "extensions",
  "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
  "location": "<location>",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', <myVM>)]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.HpcCompute",
    "type": "NvidiaGpuDriverWindows",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.4",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {
    }
  }
}
Properties
The JSON schema includes values for the following parameters.
apiVersion
publisher
type
typeHandlerVersion
Deploy the extension
Azure VM extensions can be managed by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, and the Azure portal.
Note
Some of the following examples use<placeholder>parameter values in the commands. Before you run each command, make sure to replace any placeholder values with specific values for your configuration.

Azure portal
To install the NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension in the Azure portal, follow these steps:
In theAzure portal, go to the virtual machine on which you want to install the extension.

ARM template
ARM templates are ideal when you deploy one or more virtual machines that require post-deployment configuration.
The JSON configuration for a virtual machine extension can be nested inside the virtual machine resource or placed at the root or top level of a JSON ARM template. The placement of the JSON configuration affects the value of the resourcenameandtype. For more information, seeSet name and type for child resources.
name
type
The following example assumes the extension is nested inside the virtual machine resource. When the extension resource is nested, the JSON is placed in the"resources": []object of the virtual machine.
"resources": []
{
  "name": "<myExtensionName>",
  "type": "extensions",
  "location": "[<resourceGroup().location>]",
  "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', <myVM>)]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.HpcCompute",
    "type": "NvidiaGpuDriverWindows",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.4",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {
    }
  }
}
{
  "name": "<myExtensionName>",
  "type": "extensions",
  "location": "[<resourceGroup().location>]",
  "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",

    }
  }
}
PowerShell
Use the following PowerShell command to deploy the NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension to a virtual machine.
Set-AzVMExtension
    -ResourceGroupName "<myResourceGroup>" `
    -VMName "<myVM>" `
    -Location "<location>" `
    -Publisher "Microsoft.HpcCompute" `
    -ExtensionName "NvidiaGpuDriverWindows" `
    -ExtensionType "NvidiaGpuDriverWindows" `
    -TypeHandlerVersion 1.4 `
    -SettingString '{ `
	}'
Set-AzVMExtension

Troubleshoot issues
Here are some suggestions for how to troubleshoot deployment issues.
Check extension status
Check the status of your extension deployment in the Azure portal, or by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
To see the deployment state of extensions for a given VM, run the following commands:
Get-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <myResourceGroup> -VMName <myVM> -Name <myExtensionName>
Get-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <myResourceGroup> -VMName <myVM> -Name <myExtensionName>
az vm extension list --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --vm-name <myVM> -o table
az vm extension list --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --vm-name <myVM> -o table
Review output logs
View output logs for the NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension deployment underC:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.HpcCompute.NvidiaGpuDriverWindows\.

Known issues
GRID Driver version17.xis incompatible on NVv3 (NVIDIA Tesla M60). GRID drivers up to version16.5are supported.NvidiaGpuDriverWindowsinstalls the latest drivers which are incompatible on NVv3 SKU. Instead, use the following runtime settings to force the extension to install an older version of the driver. For more information on driver versions, seeNVIDIA GPU resources.
