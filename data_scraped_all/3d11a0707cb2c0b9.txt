If you have existing Linux virtual machines (VMs) that use unmanaged disks, you can migrate the VMs to useAzure Managed Disks. This process converts both the OS disk and any attached data disks.
This article shows you how to migrate VMs by using the Azure CLI. If you need to install or upgrade it, seeInstall Azure CLI.
Before you begin
Reviewthe FAQ about migration to Managed Disks.
The migration will restart the VM, so schedule the migration of your VMs during a pre-existing maintenance window.

The migration isn't reversible.

Be sure to test the migration. Migrate a test virtual machine before you perform the migration in production.

During the migration, you deallocate the VM. The VM receives a new IP address when it's started after the migration. If needed, you canassign a static IP addressto the VM.

Review the minimum version of the Azure VM agent required to support the migration process. For information on how to check and update your agent version, seeMinimum version support for VM agents in Azure

The original VHDs and the storage account used by the VM before migration are not deleted. They continue to incur charges. To avoid being billed for these artifacts, delete the original VHD blobs after you verify that the migration is complete. If you need to find these unattached disks in order to delete them, see our articleFind and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks.
Migrate single-instance VMs
This section covers how to migrate single-instance Azure VMs from unmanaged disks to managed disks. (If your VMs are in an availability set, see the next section.) You can use this process to migrate the VMs from premium (SSD) unmanaged disks to premium managed disks, or from standard (HDD) unmanaged disks to standard managed disks.
Deallocate the VM by usingaz vm deallocate. The following example deallocates the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Deallocate the VM by usingaz vm deallocate. The following example deallocates the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
myVM
myResourceGroup
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Migrate the VM to managed disks by usingaz vm convert. The following process converts the VM namedmyVM, including the OS disk and any data disks:az vm convert --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Migrate the VM to managed disks by usingaz vm convert. The following process converts the VM namedmyVM, including the OS disk and any data disks:
myVM
az vm convert --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
az vm convert --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Start the VM after the migration to managed disks by usingaz vm start. The following example starts the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup.az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Start the VM after the migration to managed disks by usingaz vm start. The following example starts the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup.
myVM
myResourceGroup
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Migrate VMs in an availability set
If the VMs that you want to migrate to managed disks are in an availability set, you first need to migrate the availability set to a managed availability set.
All VMs in the availability set must be deallocated before you migrate the availability set. Plan to migrate all VMs to managed disks after the availability set itself has been converted to a managed availability set. Then, start all the VMs and continue operating as normal.
List all VMs in an availability set by usingaz vm availability-set list. The following example lists all VMs in the availability set namedmyAvailabilitySetin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:az vm availability-set show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAvailabilitySet \
    --query [virtualMachines[*].id] \
    --output table
List all VMs in an availability set by usingaz vm availability-set list. The following example lists all VMs in the availability set namedmyAvailabilitySetin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
myAvailabilitySet
myResourceGroup
az vm availability-set show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAvailabilitySet \
    --query [virtualMachines[*].id] \
    --output table
az vm availability-set show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAvailabilitySet \
    --query [virtualMachines[*].id] \
    --output table
Deallocate all the VMs by usingaz vm deallocate. The following example deallocates the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM

myResourceGroup
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM

Migrate the availability set by usingaz vm availability-set convert. The following example converts the availability set namedmyAvailabilitySetin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:az vm availability-set convert \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAvailabilitySet
Migrate the availability set by usingaz vm availability-set convert. The following example converts the availability set namedmyAvailabilitySetin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:
myAvailabilitySet
myResourceGroup
az vm availability-set convert \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAvailabilitySet
az vm availability-set convert \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAvailabilitySet

Start all the VMs after the migration to managed disks by usingaz vm start. The following example starts the VM namedmyVMin the resource group namedmyResourceGroup:

az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
Migrate using the Azure portal
You can also migrate unmanaged disks to managed disks using the Azure portal.
Sign in to theAzure portal.
Select the VM from the list of VMs in the portal.
In the blade for the VM, selectDisksfrom the menu.
At the top of theDisksblade, selectMigrate to managed disks.
If your VM is in an availability set, there will be a warning on theMigrate to managed disksblade that you need to migrate the availability set first. The warning should have a link you can click to migrate the availability set. Once the availability set is converted or if your VM is not in an availability set, clickMigrateto start the process of migrating your disks to managed disks.
The VM will be stopped and restarted after migration is complete.
