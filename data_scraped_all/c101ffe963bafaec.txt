This article is to help you understand the support lifecycle for the Azure OpenAI API previews. New preview APIs target a monthly release cadence. Whenever possible we recommend using either the latest GA, or preview API releases.
Note
New API response objects may be added to the API response without version changes. We recommend you only parse the response objects you require.

Latest GA API release
Azure OpenAI API version2024-10-21is currently the latest GA API release. This API version is the replacement for the previous2024-06-01GA API release.
2024-06-01
Updating API versions
We recommend first testing the upgrade to new API versions to confirm there's no impact to your application from the API update before making the change globally across your environment.
If you're using the OpenAI Python or JavaScript client libraries, or the REST API, you'll need to update your code directly to the latest preview API version.
If you're using one of the Azure OpenAI SDKs for C#, Go, or Java, you'll instead need to update to the latest version of the SDK. Each SDK release is hardcoded to work with specific versions of the Azure OpenAI API.
