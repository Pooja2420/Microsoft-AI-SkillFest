Remove a move collection or a resource group on portal
You can remove a move collection/resource group in the portal. Removing a move collection/resource group deletes all the resources in the collection.
To remove a move collection/resource group, follow these steps:
Followthese instructionsto remove resources from the collection. If you're removing a resource group, make sure it doesn't contain any resources.
Delete the move collection or resource group.
Remove a resource using PowerShell
Using PowerShell cmdlets you can remove a single resource from a MoveCollection, or remove multiple resources.
Remove a single resource
Remove a resource (in our example the virtual networkpsdemorm-vnet) as follows:
# Remove a resource using the resource ID
Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveResource -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS" -Name "psdemorm-vnet"
# Remove a resource using the resource ID
Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveResource -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS" -Name "psdemorm-vnet"
Output after running cmdlet

Remove multiple resources
Remove multiple resources as follows:
Validate dependencies:$resp = Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('psdemorm-vnet') -ValidateOnlyOutput after running cmdlet
Validate dependencies:
$resp = Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('psdemorm-vnet') -ValidateOnly
$resp = Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('psdemorm-vnet') -ValidateOnly
Output after running cmdlet

Retrieve the dependent resources that need to be removed (along with our example virtual network psdemorm-vnet):$resp.AdditionalInfo[0].InfoMoveResourceOutput after running cmdlet
Retrieve the dependent resources that need to be removed (along with our example virtual network psdemorm-vnet):
$resp.AdditionalInfo[0].InfoMoveResource
$resp.AdditionalInfo[0].InfoMoveResource
Output after running cmdlet

Remove all resources, along with the virtual network:Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('PSDemoVM','psdemovm111', 'PSDemoRM-vnet','PSDemoVM-nsg')Output after running cmdlet
Remove all resources, along with the virtual network:
Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('PSDemoVM','psdemovm111', 'PSDemoRM-vnet','PSDemoVM-nsg')
Invoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"  -MoveResource $('PSDemoVM','psdemovm111', 'PSDemoRM-vnet','PSDemoVM-nsg')
Output after running cmdlet

Remove a collection using PowerShell
Remove an entire move collection from the subscription, as follows:

Then remove a collection as follows:Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveCollection -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"Output after running cmdlet
Then remove a collection as follows:
Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveCollection -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"
Remove-AzResourceMoverMoveCollection -ResourceGroupName "RG-MoveCollection-demoRMS" -MoveCollectionName "PS-centralus-westcentralus-demoRMS"
Output after running cmdlet

Note
For removing resources in bulk where the dependency tree is not identified, useInvoke-AzResourceMoverBulkRemove (Az.ResourceMover).
VM resource state after removing
What happens when you remove a VM resource from a move collection depends on the resource state, as summarized in the table.
