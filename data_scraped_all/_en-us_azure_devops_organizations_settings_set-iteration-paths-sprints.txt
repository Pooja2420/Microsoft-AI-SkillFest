Iteration Paths, also known assprints, assign work items to specific time-box intervals. Define iteration paths at the project level and have each team select the paths they use. Iteration paths are shared among all selected teams. You can create a flat or hierarchical structure of iteration paths to support releases, subreleases, and sprints. If your team doesn't use sprints for planning and tracking work, retain the default team assignments and utilize product and portfolio backlogs and boards, though sprint planning tools wonât be applicable.
Define iteration paths and assign them to teams when you want to use the following tools:
Assign work items to sprints using the Planning pane
Query and chart work items based on Iteration Path
Forecast your product backlog
Sprints> all tools
Delivery Plans, a calendar view of team deliverables
Velocity chartandSprint burndown chart

Tip
If a team hasn't subscribed or selected an iteration path, that iteration path won't appear in a team view or tool.
For information about naming restrictions and limits placed on addition of Iteration Paths, seeAbout areas and iterations, Naming restrictions.
Tip
To quickly update iteration dates, seeChange sprint dates. However, if you need to define the iteration paths and tree structure, then follow the guidance provided in this article.
Prerequisites
For more information about acquiring permissions, seeChange project-level permissionsorSet permissions and access for work tracking.
Get started
New projects start with a single root area path matching the project name. Add other area paths under this root and use predefined iteration paths for tracking work by setting dates.
If you're new to managing projects and teams, follow these steps to configure your project and teams:
Configure Azure Boards: ReviewConfigure and customize Azure Boards.
Define area paths and teams: FollowDefine area paths and assign to a team, ensuring at least one area path per team.
Set iteration length: Decide on iteration lengths, preferably consistent across teams. SeeAbout areas and iterations.
Choose sprint structure: Choose between a flat or hierarchical sprint and release structure.
Define iteration paths.
Create teams: Create necessary teams based on step 2. SeeAdd a team, move from one default team to several teams.
Assign area paths to teams: In team configuration, assign default and other area paths to each team. FollowSet team default iteration paths.
Assign iteration paths to work items: Usebulk modifyto assign work items to iteration paths for visibility on backlogs and boards. Also, seeAssign backlog items to a sprint.
As needed, you can do the following tasks at any time:
Add more child iteration nodes
Rename an iteration path (except the root path)
Move a child iteration path under another node
Delete a child iteration path
Change the default and selected iteration paths assigned to a team
Team backlog iteration versus default iteration
Each team has access to various Agile tools, as detailed inAbout teams and Agile tools. These tools reference the team's default area paths and selected iteration paths or sprints. Typically, teams use one area path and multiple iteration paths for work tracking, but you can use multiple area paths on backlogs and boards to support different scenarios.
Teams can set a default iteration separate from the backlog iteration. The backlog iteration determines which items appear on the team's backlogs and boards, while the default iteration assigns values to newly created work items.
All work items created within the team context are automatically assigned the team's default area path and default iteration path.
List project iterations
To list project iterations, do the following steps:

DeletingArea Pathsor reconfiguringIteration Pathscauses irreversible data loss.

Velocity charts for teams with changedArea Paths
Historical trend charts that reference theArea PathandIteration Pathas they were defined at the time for each work item.
Once deleted, you can't retrieve historical data for these paths.
You can only delete area and iteration paths that are no longer used by any work items.

Export/import iteration paths
You can't export or import the structure of tree paths for one project to use with another project.
Using the Azure CLI, you can use theaz boards iterationcommand to list the iterations defined for one project and then add them to another project. Once you add the iterations to another project, you can then use theaz boards iteration teamcommand to add them to a team and set the default and backlog iteration path for the team.

You can use theClassification Nodes (REST API)andTeams (REST API)to perform similar actions.
You can use theClassification Nodes (REST API)to list the iterations defined in one project. Once you add the iterations to another project, use theTeams (REST API)to add them to a team and set the default and backlog iteration path for the team.
Archive iteration paths
After a while, you might want to archive iteration paths that were used for sprints that are a year or more out of date. You can do so by moving the iteration path under a node that you label "Archive". All work items are updated with the moved iteration path. Also, teams can de-select those sprints that have past. All data is maintained in the data store with the new iteration path assignments.
Before you archive the iterations, consider if you captured all the reports that you want.
Chart progress by iteration
You can quickly generatequeriesto view the progress for those areas. For example, you canvisualize progress of work items that are assigned to sprints, as shown in the following stacked bar chart.
