The restore operation makes a specific time range of data in a table available in the hot cache for high-performance queries. This article describes how to restore data, query that data, and then dismiss the data when you're done.
Note
Tables with theAuxiliary table plando not support data restore. Use asearch jobto retrieve data that's in long-term retention from an Auxiliary table.
Warning
Creating a data restore starts billing for each data restore until yourrestore is dismissed. Learn more about thecosts for using data restore.
Permissions
To restore data from long-term retention, you needMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/writeandMicrosoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/restoreLogs/writepermissions to the Log Analytics workspace, for example, as provided by theLog Analytics Contributor built-in role.
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/restoreLogs/write
When to restore logs
Use the restore operation to query data inlong-term retention. You can also use the restore operation to run powerful queries within a specific time range on any Analytics table when the log queries you run on the source table can't complete within the log query timeout of 10 minutes.
Note
Restore is one method for accessing data in long-term retention. Use restore to run queries against a set of data within a particular time range. UseSearch jobsto access data based on specific criteria.
What does restore do?
When you restore data, you specify the source table that contains the data you want to query and the name of the new destination table to be created.
The restore operation creates the restore table and allocates extra compute resources for querying the restored data using high-performance queries that support full KQL.
The destination table provides a view of the underlying source data, but doesn't affect it in any way. The table has no retention setting, and you must explicitlydismiss the restored datawhen you no longer need it.

Warning
When restoring data, be sure todismiss the restoreas soon as you are done using the restore. You will continue to be billed for a data restore until it is dismissed (learn more).
API
CLI
To restore data from a table, call theTables - Create or UpdateAPI. The name of the destination table must end with_RST.
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/{user defined name}_RST?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/{user defined name}_RST?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
Request body
The body of the request must include the following values:
Restore table status
TheprovisioningStateproperty indicates the current state of the restore table operation. The API returns this property when you start the restore, and you can retrieve this property later using a GET operation on the table. TheprovisioningStateproperty has one of the following values:
Sample request
This sample restores data from the month of January 2020 from theUsagetable to a table calledUsage_RST.

To restore data from a table, run theaz monitor log-analytics workspace table restore createcommand.
For example:
az monitor log-analytics workspace table restore create --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG  --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name Heartbeat_RST --restore-source-table Heartbeat --start-restore-time "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" --end-restore-time "2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z" --no-wait
az monitor log-analytics workspace table restore create --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG  --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name Heartbeat_RST --restore-source-table Heartbeat --start-restore-time "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" --end-restore-time "2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z" --no-wait
Query restored data
Restored logs retain their original timestamps. When you run a query on restored logs, set the query time range based on when the data was originally generated.
Set the query time range by either:
SelectingCustomin theTime rangedropdown at the top of the query editor and settingFromandTovalues.or
SelectingCustomin theTime rangedropdown at the top of the query editor and settingFromandTovalues.or
Specifying the time range in the query. For example:let startTime =datetime(01/01/2022 8:00:00 PM);
let endTime =datetime(01/05/2022 8:00:00 PM);
TableName_RST
| where TimeGenerated between(startTime .. endTime)
Specifying the time range in the query. For example:
let startTime =datetime(01/01/2022 8:00:00 PM);
let endTime =datetime(01/05/2022 8:00:00 PM);
TableName_RST
| where TimeGenerated between(startTime .. endTime)
let startTime =datetime(01/01/2022 8:00:00 PM);
let endTime =datetime(01/05/2022 8:00:00 PM);
TableName_RST
| where TimeGenerated between(startTime .. endTime)
Dismiss restored data
To save costs, we recommend youdelete the restored tableto dismiss restored data when you no longer need it.
Deleting the restored table doesn't delete the data in the source table.
Note
Restored data is available as long as the underlying source data is available. When you delete the source table from the workspace or when the source table's retention period ends, the data is dismissed from the restored table. However, the empty table will remain if you do not delete it explicitly.
Limitations
Restore is subject to the following limitations.
You can:
Restore data from a period of at least two days.
Restore data from a period of at least two days.
Restore up to 60 TB.

Run up to two restore processes in a workspace concurrently.

Run only one active restore on a specific table at a given time. Executing a second restore on a table that already has an active restore fails.

Pricing model
The charge for restored logs is based on the volume of data you restore, and the duration for which the restore is active. Thus, the units of price areper GB per day. Data restores are billed on each UTC-day that the restore is active.
Charges are subject to a minimum restored data volume of 2 TB per restore since restore allocates extra compute resources for querying the restored data. If you restore less data, you will be charged for the 2 TB minimum each day until therestore is dismissed.

On the first and last days that the restore is active, you're only billed for the part of the day the restore was active.

Here are some examples to illustrate data restore cost calculations:
If your table holds 500 GB a day and you restore 10 days data from that table, your total restore size is 5 TB. You are charged for this 5 TB of restored data each day until youdismiss the restored data. Your daily cost is 5,000 GB multiplied by your data restore price (seeAzure Monitor pricing.)
If your table holds 500 GB a day and you restore 10 days data from that table, your total restore size is 5 TB. You are charged for this 5 TB of restored data each day until youdismiss the restored data. Your daily cost is 5,000 GB multiplied by your data restore price (seeAzure Monitor pricing.)
If instead, only 700 GB of data is restored, each day that the restore is active is billed for the 2 TB minimum restore level. Your daily cost is 2,000 GB multiplied by your data restore price.
If instead, only 700 GB of data is restored, each day that the restore is active is billed for the 2 TB minimum restore level. Your daily cost is 2,000 GB multiplied by your data restore price.
If a 5 TB data restore is only kept active for 1 hour, it is billed for 12-hour minimum. The cost for this data restore is 5,000 GB multiplied by your data restore price multiplied by 0.5 days (the 12-hour minimum).
If a 5 TB data restore is only kept active for 1 hour, it is billed for 12-hour minimum. The cost for this data restore is 5,000 GB multiplied by your data restore price multiplied by 0.5 days (the 12-hour minimum).
If a 700 GB data restore is only kept active for 1 hour, it is billed for 12-hour minimum. The cost for this data restore is 2,000 GB (the minimum billed restore size) multiplied by your data restore price multiplied by 0.5 days (the 12-hour minimum).
If a 700 GB data restore is only kept active for 1 hour, it is billed for 12-hour minimum. The cost for this data restore is 2,000 GB (the minimum billed restore size) multiplied by your data restore price multiplied by 0.5 days (the 12-hour minimum).
Note
There is no charge for querying restored logs since they are Analytics logs.
