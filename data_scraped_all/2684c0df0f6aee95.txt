The NDv2-series virtual machine is a new addition to the GPU family designed for the needs of the most demanding GPU-accelerated AI, machine learning, simulation, and HPC workloads.
NDv2 is powered by 8 NVIDIA Tesla V100 NVLINK-connected GPUs, each with 32 GB of GPU memory. Each NDv2 VM also has 40 non-HyperThreaded Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 (Skylake) cores and 672 GiB of system memory.
NDv2 instances provide excellent performance for HPC and AI workloads utilizing CUDA GPU-optimized computation kernels, and the many AI, ML, and analytics tools that support GPU acceleration 'out-of-box,' such as TensorFlow, Pytorch, Caffe, RAPIDS, and other frameworks.
Critically, the NDv2 is built for both computationally intense scale-up (harnessing 8 GPUs per VM) and scale-out (harnessing multiple VMs working together) workloads. The NDv2 series now supports 100-Gigabit InfiniBand EDR backend networking, similar to that available on the HB series of HPC VM, to allow high-performance clustering for parallel scenarios including distributed training for AI and ML. This backend network supports all major InfiniBand protocols, including those employed by NVIDIAâs NCCL2 libraries, allowing for seamless clustering of GPUs.

1Temp disk speed often differs between RR (Random Read) and RW (Random Write) operations. RR operations are typically faster than RW operations. The RW speed is usually slower than the RR speed on series where only the RR speed value is listed.
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to ReadOnly or ReadWrite. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to None.

Network interface info for each size
Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure
Virtual machine network bandwidth
Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth
Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines.
To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
