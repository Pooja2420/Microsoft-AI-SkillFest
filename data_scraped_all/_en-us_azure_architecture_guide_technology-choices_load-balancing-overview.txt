Load-balancing options
The termload balancingrefers to the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single resource. It can also improve availability by sharing a workload across redundant computing resources.
Azure provides various load-balancing services that you can use to distribute your workloads across multiple computing resources. These resources include Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door, Azure Load Balancer, and Azure Traffic Manager.
This article describes some considerations to determine an appropriate load-balancing solution for your workload's needs.
Service categorizations
Azure load-balancing services can be categorized along two dimensions: global versus regional and HTTP(S) versus non-HTTP(S).
Global vs. regional
Global: These load-balancing services distribute traffic across regional back-ends, clouds, or hybrid on-premises services. These services support managing a single control plane responsible for globally routing end-user traffic to an available back-end. They often react to changes in service reliability or performance to maximize availability and performance. You can think of them as systems that load balance between application stamps, endpoints, or scale-units hosted across different regions/geographies.
Regional: These load-balancing services distribute traffic within virtual networks across virtual machines (VMs) or zonal and zone-redundant service endpoints within a region. You can think of them as systems that load balance between VMs, containers, or clusters within a region in a virtual network.
HTTP(S) vs. non-HTTP(S)
HTTP(S): These load-balancing services areLayer 7load balancers that only accept HTTP(S) traffic. They're intended for web applications or other HTTP(S) endpoints. They might have features such as SSL offload, web application firewall, path-based load balancing, and session affinity.
Non-HTTP(S): These load-balancing services are eitherLayer 4TCP or UDP services, or DNS-based load balancing.
The following table summarizes the Azure load-balancing services.
Note
Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer have the capabilities to distribute any traffic, including HTTP(S). However, these services do not have Layer 7 capabilities. Unlike Azure Load Balancer, Azure Traffic Manager doesn't handle the traffic directly; Traffic Manager manipulates DNS to direct clients to the appropriate endpoints.
Azure load-balancing services
Here are the main load-balancing services currently available in Azure:
Azure Front Dooris an application delivery network that provides global load balancing and site acceleration service for web applications. It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application like SSL offload, path-based routing, fast failover, and caching to improve performance and high availability of your applications.

Traffic Manageris a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load balances only at the domain level. For that reason, it can't fail over as quickly as Azure Front Door, because of common challenges around DNS caching and systems not honoring DNS TTLs.

Application Gatewayprovides application delivery controller as a service, offering various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities and web application firewall functionality. Use it to transition from public network space into your web servers hosted in private network space within a region.

Load Balanceris a high-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It's built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. Load Balancer is zone redundant, ensuring high availability across availability zones. It supports both a regional deployment topology and across-region topology.

Note
Clustering technology, such as Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Service contains load balancing constructs that operate mostly within the scope of their own cluster boundry, routing traffic to available application instances based on readiness and health probes. Those load balancing options are not covered in this article.
Decision tree for load balancing in Azure
Consider these factors such as these when you select a load balancing solution:
Traffic type: Is it a web HTTP(S) application? Is it public facing or a private application?
Global vs. regional: Do you need to load balance VMs or containers within a single virtual network, or load balance scale unit/deployments across regions, or both?
Availability: What's theservice-level agreement?
Cost: For more information, seeAzure pricing. In addition to the cost of the service itself, consider the operations cost for managing a solution built on that service.
Features and limits: What capabilities are supported on each service and what are theService limitsof each service?
Tip
The Azure portal offers a questionnaire-based guide similar to the following flowchart. In the Azure portal, search for 'Load balancing - help me choose'. By answering the questions, you can narrow down your load balancing options.
The following flowchart helps you to choose a load-balancing solution for your application. The flowchart guides you through a set of key decision criteria to reach a recommendation.
Treat this flowchart as a starting point. Every application has unique requirements, so use the recommendation as a starting point. Then perform a more detailed evaluation.
When your workload involves several services that require load balancing, it's important to assess each service individually. In many cases, an effective setup uses more than one type of load-balancing solution. You might incorporate these solutions at different places in your workload's architecture, each serving a unique function or role.

Internet facing application:Applications that are publicly accessible from the internet. As a best practice, application owners apply restrictive access policies or protect the application by setting up offerings like web application firewall and DDoS protection.

Global / Deployed in multiple regions:If this load balancer should have a single, highly available control plane that is responsible for routing traffic to public endpoints on your globally distributed application. This can be to support either active-active or active-passive topologies across regions.NoteIt is possible to use a regional service, such as Application Gateway, to load balance across backends spanning multiple regions and control routing through a single control plane. That architecture is made possible usingcross-region Private Link, global virtual network peering, or even public IPs of services in other regions.This scenario isn't the primary point of this decision, however.Using a regional resource as a router for globally distributed backends introduces a regional single point of failure and incurs additional latency as traffic is forced through one region before going to another and then back again.

Performance acceleration: Refers to features that accelerate web access. Performance acceleration can be achieved by using content delivery networks (CDNs) or optimized point of presence ingress for accelerated client onboarding into the destination network. Azure Front Door supports bothCDNsandAnycast traffic acceleration. The benefits of both features can be gained with or without Application Gateway in the architecture.

Additional considerations
Each load balancing service also has capability support or implementation details that need also be considered. Here are some examples that might be relevant for your load balancing scenario.
WebSockets support
Server-sent events (SSE) support
HTTP/2 support (both receiving and continuing to backend nodes)
Sticky session support
Backend node health monitoring mechanism
Client experience or delay between unhealthy node detection and removal from routing logic.
