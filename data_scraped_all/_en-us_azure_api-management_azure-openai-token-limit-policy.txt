Theazure-openai-token-limitpolicy prevents Azure OpenAI Service API usage spikes on a per key basis by limiting consumption of language model tokens to a specified rate (number per minute), a quota over a specified period, or both. When a specified token rate limit is exceeded, the caller receives a429 Too Many Requestsresponse status code. When a specified quota is exceeded, the caller receives a403 Forbiddenresponse status code.
azure-openai-token-limit
429 Too Many Requests
403 Forbidden
By relying on token usage metrics returned from the OpenAI endpoint, the policy can accurately monitor and enforce limits in real time. The policy also enables precalculation of prompt tokens by API Management, minimizing unnecessary requests to the OpenAI backend if the limit is already exceeded.
Note
Set the policy's elements and child elements in the order provided in the policy statement. Learn more abouthow to set or edit API Management policies.
Supported Azure OpenAI Service models
The policy is used with APIsadded to API Management from the Azure OpenAI Serviceof the following types:
1Thegpt-4omodel is multimodal (accepts text or image inputs and generates text).
gpt-4o
Note
Traditional completion APIs are only available with legacy model versions and support is limited.

Usage notes
This policy can be used multiple times per policy definition.
This policy can optionally be configured when adding an API from the Azure OpenAI Service using the portal.
Where available whenestimate-prompt-tokensis set tofalse, values in the usage section of the response from the Azure OpenAI Service API are used to determine token usage.
estimate-prompt-tokens
false
Certain Azure OpenAI endpoints support streaming of responses. Whenstreamis set totruein the API request to enable streaming, prompt tokens are always estimated, regardless of the value of theestimate-prompt-tokensattribute. Completion tokens are also estimated when responses are streamed.
stream
true
estimate-prompt-tokens
For models that accept image input, image tokens are generally counted by the backend language model and included in limit and quota calculations. However, when streaming is used orestimate-prompt-tokensis set totrue, the policy currently over-counts each image as a maximum count of 1200 tokens.
estimate-prompt-tokens
true
API Management uses a single counter for eachcounter-keyvalue that you specify in the policy. The counter is updated at all scopes at which the policy is configured with that key value. If you want to configure separate counters at different scopes (for example, a specific API or product), specify different key values at the different scopes. For example, append a string that identifies the scope to the value of an expression.
counter-key
This policy tracks token usage independently at each gateway where it is applied, includingworkspace gatewaysand regional gateways in amulti-region deployment. It doesn't aggregate token counts across the entire instance.
Examples
Token rate limit
In the following example, the token rate limit of 5000 per minute is keyed by the caller IP address. The policy doesn't estimate the number of tokens required for a prompt. After each policy execution, the remaining tokens allowed for that caller IP address in the time period are stored in the variableremainingTokens.

Token quota
In the following example, the token quota of 10000 is keyed by the subscription ID and resets monthly. After each policy execution, the number of remaining tokens allowed for that subscription ID in the time period is stored in the variableremainingQuotaTokens.
