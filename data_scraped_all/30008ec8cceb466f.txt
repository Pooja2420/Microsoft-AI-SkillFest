Through application routing or configuration routing options, you can configure what traffic is sent through the virtual network integration. For more information, see theoverview section.
Prerequisites
Your app is already integrated using the regional virtual network integration feature.
Configure application routing
Application routing defines what traffic is routed from your app and into the virtual network. We recommend that you use thevnetRouteAllEnabledsite setting to enable routing of all traffic. Using the configuration setting allows you to audit the behavior witha built-in policy. The existingWEBSITE_VNET_ROUTE_ALLapp setting can still be used, and you can enable all traffic routing with either setting.
vnetRouteAllEnabled
WEBSITE_VNET_ROUTE_ALL
Configure in the Azure portal
Follow these steps to disable outbound internet traffic routing in your app through the portal.

Go toNetworking>Virtual network integrationin your app portal.
Go toNetworking>Virtual network integrationin your app portal.
Uncheck theOutbound internet trafficsetting.
Uncheck theOutbound internet trafficsetting.

Configure with the Azure CLI
You can also configureOutbound internet trafficby using the Azure CLI.
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetRouteAllEnabled=[true|false]
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetRouteAllEnabled=[true|false]
Configure configuration routing
When you're using virtual network integration, you can configure how parts of the configuration traffic are managed. By default, configuration traffic goes directly over the public route, but for the mentioned individual components, you can actively configure it to be routed through the virtual network integration.
Container image pull
Routing container image pull over virtual network integration can be configured using the Azure CLI.
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetImagePullEnabled=[true|false]
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetImagePullEnabled=[true|false]
We recommend that you use the site property to enable routing image pull traffic through the virtual network integration. Using the configuration setting allows you to audit the behavior with Azure Policy. The existingWEBSITE_PULL_IMAGE_OVER_VNETapp setting with the valuetruecan still be used, and you can enable routing through the virtual network with either setting.
WEBSITE_PULL_IMAGE_OVER_VNET
true
Content share
Routing content share over virtual network integration can be configured using the Azure CLI. In addition to enabling the feature, you must also ensure that any firewall or Network Security Group configured on traffic from the subnet allow traffic to port 443 and 445.
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetContentShareEnabled=[true|false]
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetContentShareEnabled=[true|false]
We recommend that you use the site property to enable content share traffic through the virtual network integration. Using the configuration setting allows you to audit the behavior with Azure Policy. The existingWEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNETapp setting with the value1can still be used, and you can enable routing through the virtual network with either setting.

Backup/restore
Routing backup traffic over virtual network integration can be configured using the Azure CLI. Database backup isn't supported over the virtual network integration.
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetBackupRestoreEnabled=[true|false]
az resource update --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --set properties.vnetBackupRestoreEnabled=[true|false]
