Sometimes you need to check what access a user has to an Azure resource. You check their access by listing their assignments. A quick way to check the access for a single user is to use theCheck accessfeature on theAccess control (IAM)page.
Step 1: Open the Azure resource
To check the access for a user, you first need to open the Azure resource you want to check access for. Azure resources are organized into levels that are typically called thescope. In Azure, you can specify a scope at four levels from broad to narrow: management group, subscription, resource group, and resource.

Follow these steps to open the Azure resource that you want to check access for.
Open theAzure portal.
