Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store forkeys,secrets, andcertificates. For more information on Key Vault, seeAbout Azure Key Vault; for more information on what can be stored in a key vault, seeAbout keys, secrets, and certificates.
If you don't have anAzure subscription, create anAzure free accountbefore you begin.
Prerequisites
Use the Bash environment inAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeGet started with Azure Cloud Shell.

If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,installthe Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, seeHow to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container.If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using theaz logincommand. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, seeAuthenticate to Azure using Azure CLI.When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, seeUse and manage extensions with the Azure CLI.Runaz versionto find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, runaz upgrade.

This quickstart requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
Create a resource group
A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Use theaz group createcommand to create a resource group namedmyResourceGroupin theeastuslocation.
az group create --name "myResourceGroup" --location "EastUS"
az group create --name "myResourceGroup" --location "EastUS"
Create a key vault
Use the Azure CLIaz keyvault createcommand to create a Key Vault in the resource group from the previous step. You will need to provide some information:
Key vault name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)ImportantEach key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.
Key vault name: A string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)
Important
Each key vault must have a unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your key vault in the following examples.
Resource group name:myResourceGroup.
Resource group name:myResourceGroup.
The location:EastUS.
The location:EastUS.
az keyvault create --name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
az keyvault create --name "<your-unique-keyvault-name>" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
The output of this command shows properties of the newly created key vault. Take note of these two properties:
Vault Name: The name you provided to the--nameparameter.
--name
Vault URI: In this example, the Vault URI is https://<your-unique-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/. Applications that use your vault through its REST API must use this URI.
Clean up resources
Other quickstarts and tutorials in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you may wish to leave these resources in place.
When no longer needed, you can use the Azure CLIaz group deletecommand to remove the resource group and all related resources:
az group delete --name "myResourceGroup"
az group delete --name "myResourceGroup"
Next steps
In this quickstart you created a Key Vault and deleted it. To learn more about Key Vault and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to the articles below.
