Defender for Serversin Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a just-in-time machine access feature.
You can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud's just-in-time access to protect your Azure VMs from unauthorized network access. Many times firewalls contain allow rules that leave your VMs vulnerable to attack. JIT lets you allow access to your VMs only when the access is needed, on the ports needed, and for the period of time needed.
In this article, you learn how to set up and use just-in-time access, including how to:
Enable just-in-time on VMs from the Azure portal or programmatically
Request access to a VM that has just-in-time access enabled from the Azure portal or programmatically
Audit just-in-time access activityto make sure your VMs are secured appropriately
Prerequisites
Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2must be enabled on the subscription.

Work with JIT VM access using Microsoft Defender for Cloud
You can use Defender for Cloud or you can programmatically enable JIT VM access with your own custom options, or you can enable JIT with default, hard-coded parameters from Azure virtual machines.
Just-in-time VM accessshows your VMs grouped into:
Configured- VMs configured to support just-in-time VM access, and shows:the number of approved JIT requests in the last seven daysthe last access date and timethe connection details configuredthe last user
the number of approved JIT requests in the last seven days
the last access date and time
the connection details configured
the last user
Not configured- VMs without JIT enabled, but that can support JIT. We recommend that you enable JIT for these VMs.
Unsupported- VMs that don't support JIT because:Missing network security group (NSG) or Azure Firewall - JIT requires an NSG to be configured or a Firewall configuration (or both)Classic VM - JIT supports VMs that are deployed through Azure Resource Manager.Other - The JIT solution is disabled in the security policy of the subscription or the resource group.

Other ways to work with JIT VM access
Azure virtual machines
You can enable JIT on a VM from the Azure virtual machines pages of the Azure portal.
Tip
If a VM already has JIT enabled, the VM configuration page shows that JIT is enabled. You can use the link to open the JIT VM access page in Defender for Cloud to view and change the settings.
From theAzure portal, search for and selectVirtual machines.

Note
After a request is approved for a VM protected by Azure Firewall, Defender for Cloud provides the user with the proper connection details (the port mapping from the DNAT table) to use to connect to the VM.
PowerShell
To enable just-in-time VM access from PowerShell, use the official Microsoft Defender for Cloud PowerShell cmdletSet-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy.
Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy
Example- Enable just-in-time VM access on a specific VM with the following rules:
Close ports 22 and 3389
Set a maximum time window of 3 hours for each so they can be opened per approved request
Allow the user who is requesting access to control the source IP addresses
Allow the user who is requesting access to establish a successful session upon an approved just-in-time access request
The following PowerShell commands create this JIT configuration:
Assign a variable that holds the just-in-time VM access rules for a VM:$JitPolicy = (@{
    id="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VMNAME";
    ports=(@{
        number=22;
        protocol="*";
        allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
        maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"},
        @{
        number=3389;
        protocol="*";
        allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
        maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"})})
Assign a variable that holds the just-in-time VM access rules for a VM:
$JitPolicy = (@{
    id="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VMNAME";
    ports=(@{
        number=22;
        protocol="*";
        allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
        maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"},
        @{
        number=3389;
        protocol="*";
        allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
        maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"})})
$JitPolicy = (@{
    id="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VMNAME";
    ports=(@{
        number=22;
        protocol="*";
        allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
        maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"},
        @{
        number=3389;
        protocol="*";
        allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");
        maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"})})
Insert the VM just-in-time VM access rules into an array:$JitPolicyArr=@($JitPolicy)
Insert the VM just-in-time VM access rules into an array:
$JitPolicyArr=@($JitPolicy)
$JitPolicyArr=@($JitPolicy)
Configure the just-in-time VM access rules on the selected VM:Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Kind "Basic" -Location "LOCATION" -Name "default" -ResourceGroupName "RESOURCEGROUP" -VirtualMachine $JitPolicyArrUse the -Name parameter to specify a VM. For example, to establish the JIT configuration for two different VMs, VM1 and VM2, use:Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Name VM1andSet-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Name VM2.
Configure the just-in-time VM access rules on the selected VM:
Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Kind "Basic" -Location "LOCATION" -Name "default" -ResourceGroupName "RESOURCEGROUP" -VirtualMachine $JitPolicyArr
Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Kind "Basic" -Location "LOCATION" -Name "default" -ResourceGroupName "RESOURCEGROUP" -VirtualMachine $JitPolicyArr
Use the -Name parameter to specify a VM. For example, to establish the JIT configuration for two different VMs, VM1 and VM2, use:Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Name VM1andSet-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Name VM2.
Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Name VM1
Set-AzJitNetworkAccessPolicy -Name VM2
In the following example, you can see a just-in-time VM access request to a specific VM for port 22, for a specific IP address, and for a specific amount of time:
Run the following commands in PowerShell:
Configure the VM request access properties:$JitPolicyVm1 = (@{
    id="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VMNAME";
    ports=(@{
      number=22;
      endTimeUtc="2020-07-15T17:00:00.3658798Z";
      allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("IPV4ADDRESS")})})
Configure the VM request access properties:
$JitPolicyVm1 = (@{
    id="/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VMNAME";
    ports=(@{
      number=22;
      endTimeUtc="2020-07-15T17:00:00.3658798Z";

      endTimeUtc="2020-07-15T17:00:00.3658798Z";
      allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("IPV4ADDRESS")})})
Insert the VM access request parameters in an array:$JitPolicyArr=@($JitPolicyVm1)
