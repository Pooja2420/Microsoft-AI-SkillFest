Remarks
When adoptingagent releases that exclude the Node 6 task runneryou may have an occasional need to run tasks that have not been updated to use a newer Node runner. For this scenario we provide a way to still use tasks dependent on Node End-of-Life runners. For more information, see Node runner guidanceblog post.
The following task example shows how to install the Node 6 runner just-in-time, so an older task can successfully run.
