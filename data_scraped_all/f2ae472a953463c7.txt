H-series VMs are optimized for applications driven by high CPU frequencies or large memory per core requirements. H-series VMs feature 8 or 16 Intel Xeon E5 2667 v3 processor cores, up to 14 GB of RAM per CPU core, and no hyperthreading. H-series features 56 Gb/sec Mellanox FDR InfiniBand in a non-blocking fat tree configuration for consistent RDMA performance. H-series VMs are not SR-IOV enabled currently and support Intel MPI 5.x and MS-MPI.

Note
Among theRDMA capable VMs, the H-series are not SR-IOV enabled. Therefore, the supportedVM Images,InfiniBand driverrequirements and supportedMPI librariesare different from the SR-IOV enabled VMs.
A quirk of the alternate NIC virtualization solution in place for the H-series is that the OS may occasionally report inaccurate link speeds for the synthetic NIC that is used for RDMA connections. This issue does not, however, impact actual performance experienced by jobs using the VM's RDMA capability, so outputs like the following are not a cause for concern.

Size table definitions
Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.

Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.

Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toReadOnlyorReadWrite.  For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set toNone.

Expected network bandwidthis the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, seeVirtual machine network bandwidth.Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, seeOptimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines. To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, seeBandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP).
