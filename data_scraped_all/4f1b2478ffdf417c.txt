Overview
Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone app that makes it easy to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
In this article, we demonstrate several ways of connecting to and managing your Azure storage accounts.

Prerequisites
Windows
macOS
Ubuntu
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
The following versions of Windows support the latest versions of Storage Explorer:
Windows 11
Windows 10
Other requirements include:
Your Windows installation must support 64-bit applications (starting with Storage Explorer 1.30.0).
You must have a .NET 8 runtime installed (starting with Storage Explorer 1.34.0) which matches the architecture of your Storage Explorer install. The Storage Explorer installer installs a .NET 8 runtime if you don't already have one installed, but it might not be the latest version available. It is your responsibility to keep your .NET install up to date. You can download the latest .NET 8 runtime fromhere.
The following versions of macOS support Storage Explorer:
macOS 10.15 Catalina and later versions
Both x64 (Intel) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) versions of Storage Explorer are available for download starting with Storage Explorer 1.31.0.
Storage Explorer is available in theSnap Store. The Storage Explorer snap installs all of its dependencies and updates when new versions are published to the Snap Store.
Ubuntu comes preinstalled withsnapd, which allows you to run snaps. You can learn more on thesnapdinstallation page.

Storage Explorer requires the use of a password manager. You can connect Storage Explorer to your system's password manager by running the following command:
snap connect storage-explorer:password-manager-service :password-manager-service
snap connect storage-explorer:password-manager-service :password-manager-service
Installing the Storage Explorer snap is recommended, but Storage Explorer is also available as a.tar.gzdownload. If you use the.tar.gz, you must install all of Storage Explorer's dependencies manually.

Note
Storage Explorer hasn't been tested for SLES. You can try using Storage Explorer on your system, but we can't guarantee that Storage Explorer works as expected.

Connect to a storage account or service
Storage Explorer provides several ways to connect to Azure resources:
Sign in to Azure to access your subscriptions and their resources
Attach to an individual Azure Storage resource
Sign in to Azure
Note
To fully access resources after you sign in, Storage Explorer requires both management (Azure Resource Manager) and data layer permissions. This means that you need Microsoft Entra permissions to access your storage account, the containers in the account, and the data in the containers. If you have permissions only at the data layer, consider choosing theSign in using Microsoft Entra IDoption when attaching to a resource. For more information about the specific permissions Storage Explorer requires, see theAzure Storage Explorer troubleshooting guide.
In Storage Explorer, selectView>Account Managementor select theManage Accountsbutton.

Attach to an individual resource
Storage Explorer lets you connect to individual resources, such as an Azure Data Lake Storage container, using various authentication methods. Some authentication methods are only supported for certain resource types.
Storage Explorer can also connect to alocal storage emulatorusing the emulator's configured ports.
To connect to an individual resource, select theConnectbutton in the left-hand toolbar. Then follow the instructions for the resource type you want to connect to.

When a connection to a storage account is successfully added, a new tree node appears underLocal & Attached>Storage Accounts.
For other resource types, a new node is added underLocal & Attached>Storage Accounts>(Attached Containers). The node appears under a group node matching its type. For example, a new connection to an Azure Data Lake Storage container appears underBlob Containers.
If Storage Explorer couldn't add your connection, or if you can't access your data after successfully adding the connection, see theAzure Storage Explorer troubleshooting guide.
The following sections describe the different authentication methods you can use to connect to individual resources.

Storage Explorer can use your Azure account to connect to the following resource types:
Blob containers
Azure Data Lake Storage containers
Azure Data Lake Storage directories
Queues
Microsoft Entra ID is the preferred option if you have data layer access to your resource but no management layer access.
Sign in to at least one Azure account using thesign-in steps.
In theSelect Resourcepanel of theConnect to Azure Storagedialog, selectBlob container,ADLS Gen2 container, orQueue.
SelectSign in using Microsoft Entra IDand selectNext.
Select an Azure account and tenant. The account and tenant must have access to the Storage resource you want to attach to. SelectNext.
Enter a display name for your connection and the URL of the resource. SelectNext.
Review your connection information in theSummarypanel. If the connection information is correct, selectConnect.
Storage Explorer can connect to a storage account using the storage account's name and key.
You can find your account keys in theAzure portal. Open your storage account page and selectSettings>Access keys.
In theSelect Resourcepanel of theConnect to Azure Storagedialog, selectStorage account.
SelectAccount name and keyand selectNext.
Enter a display name for your connection, the name of the account, and one of the account keys. Select the appropriate Azure environment. SelectNext.
Review your connection information in theSummarypanel. If the connection information is correct, selectConnect.
Storage Explorer can connect to a storage account using a connection string with a Shared Access Signature (SAS). A SAS connection string looks like this:
SharedAccessSignature=sv=2020-04-08&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2021-03-02T00%3A22%3A19Z&se=2020-03-03T00%3A22%3A19Z&sp=rl&sig=fFFpX%2F5tzqmmFFaL0wRffHlhfFFLn6zJuylT6yhOo%2FY%3F;

In theSelect Resourcepanel of theConnect to Azure Storagedialog, selectStorage account.
SelectShared access signature (SAS)and selectNext.
Enter a display name for your connection and the SAS connection string for the storage account. SelectNext.
Review your connection information in theSummarypanel. If the connection information is correct, selectConnect.
Storage Explorer can connect to the following resource types using a SAS URI:
Blob container
Azure Data Lake Storage container or directory
File share
Queue
Table
A SAS URI looks like this:
https://contoso.blob.core.windows.net/container01?sv=2020-04-08&st=2021-03-02T00%3A30%3A33Z&se=2020-03-03T00%3A30%3A33Z&sr=c&sp=rl&sig=z9VFdWffrV6FXU51T8b8HVfipZPOpYOFLXuQw6wfkFY%3F

In theSelect Resourcepanel of theConnect to Azure Storagedialog, select the resource you want to connect to.
SelectShared access signature (SAS)and selectNext.
Enter a display name for your connection and the SAS URI for the resource. SelectNext.
Review your connection information in theSummarypanel. If the connection information is correct, selectConnect.
Storage Explorer can connect to an Azure Storage emulator. Currently, there are two supported emulators:
Azure Storage Emulator(Windows only)
Azurite(Windows, macOS, or Linux)
If your emulator is listening on the default ports, you can use theLocal & Attached>Storage Accounts>Emulator - Default Portsnode to access your emulator.
If you want to use a different name for your connection, or if your emulator isn't running on the default ports:
Start your emulator.ImportantStorage Explorer doesn't automatically start your emulator. You must start it manually.
Start your emulator.

Storage Explorer doesn't automatically start your emulator. You must start it manually.
In theSelect Resourcepanel of theConnect to Azure Storagedialog, selectLocal storage emulator.
In theSelect Resourcepanel of theConnect to Azure Storagedialog, selectLocal storage emulator.
Enter a display name for your connection and the port number for each emulated service you want to use. If you don't want to use to a service, leave the corresponding port blank. SelectNext.

Service level shared access signature
You can get a shared access signature at the service level. For more information, seeGet the SAS for a blob container.
Search for storage accounts
To find a storage resource, you can search in theEXPLORERpane.
As you enter text in the search box, Storage Explorer displays all resources that match the search value you entered up to that point. This example shows a search forendpoints:

Note
To speed up your search, useAccount Managementto deselect any subscriptions that don't contain the item you're searching for. You can also right-click a node and selectSearch From Hereto start searching from a specific node.
