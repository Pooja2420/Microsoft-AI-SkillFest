Learn how to create and manage an Azure AI services resource. An Azure AI services resource allows you to access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials.
You can access Azure AI services through two different resource kinds:
Azure AI services multi-service resource:Access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials.Consolidates billing from the services you use.
Access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials.
Consolidates billing from the services you use.
Single-service resource such as Face and Vision:Access a single Azure AI service with a unique set of credentials for each service created.Most Azure AI services offer a free tier to try it out.
Access a single Azure AI service with a unique set of credentials for each service created.
Most Azure AI services offer a free tier to try it out.
Azure AI services are Azureresourcesthat you create under your Azure subscription. After you create a resource, you can use the keys and endpoint generated to authenticate your applications.
Supported services with a multi-service resource
The multi-service resource enables access to the following Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. Some services are available via the multi-service resource and single-service resource.
Tip
We recommend whenever possible to use theAzure AI servicesresource (where the API kind isAIServices) to access multiple Azure AI services with a single set of credentials. For services not available via the multi-service resource (such as Face and Custom Vision), you can create a single-service resource.

On theCreatepage, provide the following information:Project detailsDescriptionSubscriptionSelect one of your available Azure subscriptions.Resource groupThe Azure resource group that will contain your Azure AI services resource. You can create a new group or add it to a pre-existing group.RegionThe location of your Azure AI service instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource.NameA descriptive name for your Azure AI services resource. For example,MyAIServicesResource.Pricing tierThe cost of your Azure AI services account depends on the options you choose and your usage. For more information, see the APIpricing details.

Tip
If your subscription doesn't allow you to create an Azure AI services resource, you might need to enable the privilege of thatAzure resource providerusing theAzure portal,PowerShell commandor anAzure CLI command. If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role ofOwnerorAdminto complete the registration for you or ask for the/register/actionprivileges to be granted to your account.
Clean up resources
If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.
In the Azure portal, expand the menu on the left side to open the menu of services, and chooseResource Groupsto display the list of your resource groups.
Locate the resource group containing the resource to be deleted.
If you want to delete the entire resource group, select the resource group name. On the next page, SelectDelete resource group, and confirm.
If you want to delete only the Azure AI services resource, select the resource group to see all the resources within it. On the next page, select the resource that you want to delete, select the ellipsis menu for that row, and selectDelete.
Use this quickstart to create an Azure AI services resource usingAzure Command-Line Interface (CLI)commands.

Create a new resource group
Before you create an Azure AI services resource, you must have an Azure resource group to contain the resource. When you create a new resource, you can either create a new resource group, or use an existing one. This article shows how to create a new resource group.
To create a resource, you'll need one of the Azure locations available for your subscription. You can retrieve a list of available locations with theaz account list-locationscommand. Most Azure AI services can be accessed from several locations. Choose the one closest to you, or see which locations are available for the service.
Important
Remember your Azure location, as you will need it when calling the Azure AI services resources.
The availability of some Azure AI services can vary by region. For more information, seeAzure products by region.
az account list-locations --query "[].{Region:name}" --out table
az account list-locations --query "[].{Region:name}" --out table
After you have your Azure location, create a new resource group in the Azure CLI using theaz group createcommand. In the example below, replace the Azure locationwestus2with one of the Azure locations available for your subscription.
westus2
az group create --name ai-services-resource-group --location westus2
az group create --name ai-services-resource-group --location westus2
Create an Azure AI services multi-service resource
To create and subscribe to a new Azure AI services resource, use theaz cognitiveservices account createcommand. This command adds a new billable resource to the resource group you created earlier. When you create your new resource, you'll need to know the kind of service you want to use, along with its pricing tier (or SKU) and an Azure location.
Important
Azure provides more than one resource kinds for Azure AI services. Be sure to create one with thekindofAIServices.

You can create a Standard S0 Azure AI services multi-service resource namedmulti-service-resourcewith the command below.
multi-service-resource
az cognitiveservices account create --name multi-service-resource --resource-group ai-services-resource-group  --kind AIServices --sku S0 --location westus2 --yes
az cognitiveservices account create --name multi-service-resource --resource-group ai-services-resource-group  --kind AIServices --sku S0 --location westus2 --yes
Tip
If your subscription doesn't allow you to create an Azure AI services resource, you might need to enable the privilege of thatAzure resource providerusing theAzure portal,PowerShell commandor anAzure CLI command. If you are not the subscription owner, ask someone with the role ofOwnerorAdminto complete the registration for you or ask for the/register/actionprivileges to be granted to your account.
Get current quota usage for your resource
Use theaz cognitiveservices account list-usagecommand to get the usage for your resource.
az cognitiveservices account list-usage --name multi-service-resource --resource-group ai-services-resource-group --subscription subscription-name
az cognitiveservices account list-usage --name multi-service-resource --resource-group ai-services-resource-group --subscription subscription-name
Clean up resources
If you want to clean up and remove an Azure AI services resource, you can delete it or the resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources contained in the group.
To remove the resource group and its associated resources, use theaz group delete command.
az group delete command
az group delete --name ai-services-resource-group
az group delete --name ai-services-resource-group
