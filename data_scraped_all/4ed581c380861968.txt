In this article
In this article, you learn how to update a peered virtual network by modifying, adding, or deleting an address space using the Azure portal. These updates don't incur downtime interruptions. This feature is useful when you need to grow or resize the virtual networks in Azure after scaling your workloads.
Prerequisites
There are two items:
An existing peered virtual network with two virtual networks

If you add an address space, ensure that it doesn't overlap other address spaces

Modify the address range prefix of an existing address range
In this section, you modify the address range prefix for an existing address range within your peered virtual network.
In the search box at the top of the Azure portal, entervirtual networks. SelectVirtual networksfrom the search results.

We recommend that you run sync after every resize address space operation instead of performing multiple resizing operations and then running the sync operation.The following actions require you to sync:Modifying the address range prefix of an existing address range, for example changing 10.1.0.0/16 to 10.1.0.0/18Adding address ranges to a virtual networkDeleting address ranges from a virtual network

Add an address range
In this section, you add an IP address range to the IP address space of a peered virtual network.

Delete an address range
In this task, you delete an IP address range from a subnet in a peered virtual network.
Important
Before you can delete an address space, it must be empty. If a resource or service exists in the address range, you can't remove the address range. To remove an address range, you must remove any resource or services using the address range within the subnet.
