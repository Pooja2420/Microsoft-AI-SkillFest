In a Microsoft Purview Data Map, you can create scan rule sets to enable you to customizedata source scansin your organization.
A scan rule set is a container for grouping a set of scan rules together so that you can easily associate them with a scan. For example, you might create a default scan rule set for each of your data source types, and then use these scan rule sets by default for all scans within your company. You might also want users with the right permissions to create other scan rule sets with different configurations based on business need.
Steps to create a scan rule set
To create a scan rule set:
From the Microsoft Purview portal select theData Mapsolution.

Give your scan rule set aName. The maximum length is 63 characters, with no spaces allowed. Optionally, enter aDescription. The maximum length is 256 characters.

Ignore patterns
Microsoft Purview supports defining regular expressions (regex) to exclude assets during scanning. During scanning, Microsoft Purview will compare the asset's URL against these regular expressions. All assets matching any of the regexes mentioned will be ignored while scanning.
TheIgnore patternsblade pre-populates one regex for spark transaction files. You can remove the pre-existing pattern if it is not required. You can define up to 10 ignore patterns.

In the above example:
Regexes 2 and 3 ignore all files ending with .txt and .csv during scanning.
Regex 4 ignores /folderB/ and all its contents during scanning.
Here are some more tips you can use to ignore patterns:
While processing the regex, Microsoft Purview will add $ to the regex by default.
While processing the regex, Microsoft Purview will add $ to the regex by default.
A good way to understand what url the scanning agent will compare with your regular expression is to browse through Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog, find the asset you want to ignore in the future, and see its fully qualified name (FQN) in theOverviewtab.

System scan rule sets
System scan rule sets are Microsoft-defined scan rule sets that are automatically created for each Microsoft Purview catalog. Each system scan rule set is associated with a specific data source type. When you create a scan, you can associate it with a system scan rule set. Every time Microsoft makes an update to these system rule sets, you can update them in your catalog, and apply the update to all the associated scans.
To view the list of system scan rule sets, selectScan rule setsin theManagement Centerand choose theSystemtab.
To view the list of system scan rule sets, selectScan rule setsin theManagement Centerand choose theSystemtab.

Each system scan rule set has aName,Source type, and aVersion. If you select the version number of a scan rule set in theVersioncolumn, you see the rules associated with the current version and the previous versions (if any).

If an update is available for a system scan rule set, you can selectUpdatein theVersioncolumn. In the system scan rule page, choose from a version from theSelect a new version to updatedrop-down list. The page provides a list of system classification rules associated with the new version and current version.
