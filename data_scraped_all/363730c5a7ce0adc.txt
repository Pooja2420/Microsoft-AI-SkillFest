(Get-AipServiceConfiguration).FunctionalState
Enabled
If the functional state isDisabled, runEnable-AipService.
If the functional state isDisabled, runEnable-AipService.
Disabled
Enable-AipService
Step 2: Add the Microsoft Information Protection Sync Service service principal
TheMicrosoft Information Protection Sync Serviceservice principal is not available in Azure China tenants by default, and is required for Azure Information Protection. Create this service principal manually via the Azure Az PowerShell module.
If you don't have the Azure Az module installed, install it or use a resource where the Azure Az module comes preinstalled, such asAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeInstall the Azure Az PowerShell module.
If you don't have the Azure Az module installed, install it or use a resource where the Azure Az module comes preinstalled, such asAzure Cloud Shell. For more information, seeInstall the Azure Az PowerShell module.
Connect to the service using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet and theazurechinacloudenvironment name:Connect-azaccount -environmentname azurechinacloud
Connect to the service using theConnect-AzAccountcmdlet and theazurechinacloudenvironment name:
azurechinacloud
Connect-azaccount -environmentname azurechinacloud

New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId 870c4f2e-85b6-4d43-bdda-6ed9a579b725
After adding the service principal, add the relevant permissions required to the service.
After adding the service principal, add the relevant permissions required to the service.
Step 3: Configure DNS encryption
For encryption to work correctly, Office client applications must connect to the China instance of the service and bootstrap from there. To redirect client applications to the right service instance, the tenant admin must configure a DNS SRV record with information about the Azure RMS URL. Without the DNS SRV record, the client application will attempt to connect to the public cloud instance by default and will fail.
Also, the assumption is that users will log in with a username based off the tenant-owned domain (for example,joe@contoso.cn), and not theonmschinausername (for example,joe@contoso.onmschina.cn). The domain name from the username is used for DNS redirection to the correct service instance.
joe@contoso.cn
onmschina
joe@contoso.onmschina.cn
Get the RMS ID:Launch PowerShell as an administrator.If the AIPService module isn't installed, runInstall-Module AipService.Connect to the service usingConnect-AipService -environmentname azurechinacloud.Run(Get-AipServiceConfiguration).RightsManagementServiceIdto get the RMS ID.
Get the RMS ID:
Launch PowerShell as an administrator.
If the AIPService module isn't installed, runInstall-Module AipService.
Install-Module AipService
Connect to the service usingConnect-AipService -environmentname azurechinacloud.
Connect-AipService -environmentname azurechinacloud
Run(Get-AipServiceConfiguration).RightsManagementServiceIdto get the RMS ID.
(Get-AipServiceConfiguration).RightsManagementServiceId
Log in to your DNS provider, navigate to the DNS settings for the domain, and then add a new SRV record.Service =_rmsredirProtocol =_httpName =_tcpTarget =[GUID].rms.aadrm.cn(where GUID is the RMS ID)Priority, Weight, Seconds, TTL = default values

Log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center with the corresponding global admin credentials and add the domain (for example,contoso.cn) for user creation. In the verification process, additional DNS changes might be required. Once verification is done, users can be created.

Step 4: Install and configure the labeling client
Download and install the the Microsoft Purview Information Protection client from theMicrosoft Download Center.
For more information, see:
Extend sensitivity labeling on Windows
Microsoft Purview Information Protection client - Release management and supportability
Step 5: Configure Windows settings
Windows needs the following registry key for authentication to point to the correct sovereign cloud for Azure China:
Registry node =HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\MSIP
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\MSIP
Name =CloudEnvType
CloudEnvType
Value =6(default = 0)
6
Type =REG_DWORD
REG_DWORD
Important
Make sure you don't delete the registry key after an uninstall. If the key is empty, incorrect, or non-existent, the functionality will behave as the default value (default value = 0 for the commercial cloud). If the key is empty or incorrect, a print error is also added to the log.
Step 6: Install the information protection scanner and manage content scan jobs
Install the Microsoft Purview Information Protection scanner to scan your network and content shares for sensitive data, and apply classification and protection labels as configured in your organization's policy.
When configuring and managing your content scan jobs, use the following procedure instead of theMicrosoft Purview compliance portalthat's used by the commercial offerings.
For more information, seeLearn about the information protection scannerandManage your content scan jobs using PowerShell only.
To install and configure your scanner:
Sign in to the Windows Server computer that will run the scanner. Use an account that has local administrator rights and that has permissions to write to the SQL Server master database.
