FSLogix profile containers store a complete user profile in a single container and are designed to roam profiles in non-persistent remote computing environments like Azure Virtual Desktop. When you sign in, the container dynamically attaches to the computing environment using a locally supported virtual hard disk (VHD) and Hyper-V virtual hard disk (VHDX). These advanced filter-driver technologies allow the user profile to be immediately available and appear in the system exactly like a local user profile. To learn more about FSLogix profile containers, seeUser profile management with FSLogix profile containers.
You can create FSLogix profile containers usingAzure NetApp Files, an easy-to-use Azure native platform service that helps customers quickly and reliably provision enterprise-grade SMB volumes for their Azure Virtual Desktop environments. To learn more about Azure NetApp Files, seeWhat is Azure NetApp Files?.
Note
This article doesn't cover best practices for securing access to the Azure NetApp Files share.

Considerations
To ensure optimal performance and scalability, limit the number of concurrent users accessing FSLogix profile containers on a single Azure NetApp Files regular volume to 3,000. Exceeding this limit can significantly increase latency. If your scenario requires more than 3,000 concurrent users, consider distributing users across volumes with each volume in a different availability zone. If this solution doesn't meet your needs, please completethis form.
FSLogix profile containers on Azure NetApp Files can only be accessed by users authenticating from Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Azure NetApp files does not support Entra joined, Entra hybrid joined devices or Entra and Entra hybrid identities.
To protect your FSLogix profile containers, consider usingAzure NetApp Files snapshotsandAzure NetApp Files backup.
Prerequisites
Before you can configure an FSLogix profile container with Azure NetApp Files, you must have:
An Azure account with contributor or administrator permissions.
Set up your Azure NetApp Files account
To get started, you need to create and set up an Azure NetApp Files account.
To create a NetApp account, seeCreate a NetApp account.
To create a NetApp account, seeCreate a NetApp account.
You need to create a new capacity pool. SeeCreate a capacity pool for Azure NetApp Files.

You then need to join an Active Directory connection. SeeCreate and manage Active Directory connections for Azure NetApp Files.

Create a new SMB volume. Follow the steps inCreate an SMB volume for Azure NetApp Files.NoteIt's recommended that you enable Continuous Availability on the SMB volume for use with FSLogix profile containers, so selectEnable Continuous Availability. For more information, seeEnable Continuous Availability on existing SMB volumes.

Configure permissions
When configuring the directory and file-level permissions, review the recommended list of permissions for FSLogix profiles atConfigure the storage permissions for profile containers.
Without proper directory-level permissions in place, a user can delete the user profile or access the personal information of a different user. It's important to make sure users have proper permissions to prevent accidental deletion from happening.
Configure FSLogix on your local Windows device
To configure FSLogix on your local Windows device:
Follow the steps inInstall FSLogix Applications. If configuring FSLogix in a host pool, download the file while you're still remoted in the session host VM.

To configure your profile container, seeConfigure profile containers.NoteWhen adding theVHDLocationsregistry key, set the data type toMulti-Stringand set its data value to the URI for the Azure NetApp Files share.Be careful when creating theDeleteLocalProfileWhenVHDShouldApplyvalue. When the FSLogix Profiles system determines a user should have an FSLogix profile, but a local profile already exists, Profile Container will permanently delete the local profile. The user will then be signed in with the new FSLogix profile.
