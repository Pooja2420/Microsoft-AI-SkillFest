High Efficiency Video Coding (H.265) hardware acceleration is currently in preview. See theSupplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previewsfor legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Azure Virtual Desktop supports graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration in rendering and encoding for improved app performance and scalability using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). GPU acceleration is crucial for graphics-intensive applications, such as those used by graphic designers, video editors, 3D modelers, data analysts, or visualization specialists.
There are three components to GPU acceleration in Azure Virtual Desktop that work together to improve the user experience:
GPU-accelerated application rendering: Use the GPU to render graphics in a remote session.
GPU-accelerated application rendering: Use the GPU to render graphics in a remote session.
GPU-accelerated frame encoding: The Remote Desktop Protocol encodes all graphics rendered for transmission to the local device. When part of the screen is frequently updated, it's encoded with the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video codec, also known as H.264.
GPU-accelerated frame encoding: The Remote Desktop Protocol encodes all graphics rendered for transmission to the local device. When part of the screen is frequently updated, it's encoded with the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video codec, also known as H.264.
Full-screen video encoding: A full-screen video profile provides a higher frame rate and better user experience, but uses more network bandwidth and both session host and client resources. It benefits applications such as 3D modeling, CAD/CAM, or video playback and editing. You can choose to encode it with:AVC/H.264.High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), also known as H.265. This allows for 25-50% data compression compared to AVC/H.264, at the same video quality or improved quality at the same bitrate.

Note
If you enable both HEVC/H.265 and AVC/H.264 hardware acceleration, but HEVC/H.265 isn't available on the local device, AVC/H.264 is used instead.

You can enable full-screen video encoding with AVC/H.264 even without GPU acceleration, but HEVC/H.265 requires a compatible GPU-enabled remote virtual machine.

This article shows you which Azure VM sizes you can use as a session host with GPU acceleration, and how to enable GPU acceleration for rendering and encoding.
Supported GPU-optimized Azure VM sizes
The following table lists which Azure VM sizes are optimized for GPU acceleration and supported as session hosts in Azure Virtual Desktop:
The right choice of VM size depends on many factors, including your particular application workloads, desired quality of user experience, and cost. In general, larger and more capable GPUs offer a better user experience at a given user density. Smaller and fractional GPU sizes allow more fine-grained control over cost and quality.
VM sizes with an NVIDIA GPU come with a GRID license that supports 25 concurrent users.
Important
Azure NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND, and NDv2 series VMs aren't generally appropriate as session hosts. These VM sizes are tailored for specialized, high-performance compute or machine learning tools, such as those built with NVIDIA CUDA. They don't support GPU acceleration for most applications or the Windows user interface.
Prerequisites
Before you can enable GPU acceleration, you need:
An existing host pool with session hosts using asupported GPU-optimized Azure VM sizefor the graphics features you want to enable. Supported graphics drivers are listed inInstall supported graphics drivers in your session hosts.

Install supported graphics drivers in your session hosts
To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs in Azure Virtual Desktop, you must install the appropriate graphics drivers. Follow the instructions atSupported operating systems and driversto learn how to install drivers.
Important
Only Azure-distributed drivers are supported.
When installing drivers, here are some important guidelines:
For VMs sizes with an NVIDIA GPU, only NVIDIAGRIDdrivers support GPU acceleration for most applications and the Windows user interface. NVIDIACUDAdrivers don't support GPU acceleration for these VM sizes. To download and learn how to install the driver, seeInstall NVIDIA GPU drivers on N-series VMs running Windowsand be sure to install the GRID driver. If you install the driver by using theNVIDIA GPU Driver Extension, the GRID driver is automatically installed for these VM sizes.For HEVC/H.265 hardware acceleration, you must use NVIDIA GPU driver GRID 16.2 (537.13) or later.
