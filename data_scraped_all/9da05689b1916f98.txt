This article helps you understand options available to programmatically create Azure subscriptions.
Using various REST APIs you can create a subscription for the following Azure agreement types:
Enterprise Agreement (EA)
Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)
Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA)
You can't create support plans programmatically. You can buy a new support plan or upgrade one in the Azure portal. Navigate toHelp + supportand then at the top of the page, selectChoose the right support plan.
Requirements and details to create subscriptions differ for different agreements and API versions. See the following articles that apply to your situation:
Latest APIs:
Create EA subscriptions
Create MCA subscriptions
Create MPA subscriptions
These articles also show how to create subscriptions with an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template). An ARM template helps automate the subscription creation process.
If you're still usingpreview APIs, you can continue to create subscriptions with them.
