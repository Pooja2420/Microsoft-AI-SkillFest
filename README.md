Introduction to MigrateSense AI – A Custom LLM for Cloud Migration
MigrateSense AI is a custom-built Large Language Model (LLM)–powered assistant designed to streamline and automate the end-to-end migration of applications, APIs, and databases to Microsoft Azure. At its core, MigrateSense AI is more than a chatbot—it is a purpose-trained language model, fine-tuned on Azure-specific documentation and enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent orchestration. The project exemplifies the development of a domain-specialized LLM that offers deep contextual understanding, real-time decision-making, and intelligent code reasoning in the context of cloud migration.

Unlike general-purpose models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, MigrateSense AI is trained specifically to handle cloud migration use cases. The model was fine-tuned using over 240MB of Microsoft Learn content, covering service architectures, pricing strategies, and infrastructure design patterns for Azure. Paired with a FAISS-based vector database and a real-time Microsoft Docs scraper, the system retrieves highly relevant information, even for nuanced technical queries. This enables the LLM to provide grounded, accurate, and context-aware responses.

To ensure practical deployment, MigrateSense AI is wrapped in a multi-agent framework. Each agent specializes in a key part of the migration lifecycle: the Migration Analyzer identifies the user’s current stack; the Service Mapper recommends Azure alternatives; the Cost Estimator uses rough scale metrics to predict Azure pricing; and the Optimization Agent proposes best practices to reduce cloud costs. These agents work in tandem with the LLM to interpret queries, identify missing details, and reason through possible migration paths—turning raw queries into intelligent cloud strategies.

The front end is built using Streamlit, offering an interactive chat-based experience with multi-turn context memory. This allows MigrateSense AI to guide users through a complete migration conversation—from understanding the current application architecture to generating a migration plan. Responses are generated by combining RAG-retrieved documents with the fine-tuned model’s reasoning capabilities, allowing the assistant to function like a real Azure architect.

As a custom LLM project, MigrateSense AI showcases the power of domain-tuned language models. It demonstrates how focused training data, architectural constraints, and retrieval systems can work together to produce a lightweight, fast, and highly relevant alternative to massive general-purpose LLMs. This makes it an ideal solution for use cases requiring both depth of knowledge and operational efficiency.

Looking forward, the project is evolving toward full automation of migration workflows. The future roadmap includes code conversion from legacy stacks (e.g., SQL Server → PostgreSQL, .NET → Python), infrastructure-as-code generation (Terraform, Bicep), CI/CD pipeline recommendations, live Azure pricing integration, compliance tagging, and PDF export of migration playbooks. With these enhancements, MigrateSense AI will serve not just as a migration assistant but as a fully autonomous co-pilot for cloud transformation projects.
