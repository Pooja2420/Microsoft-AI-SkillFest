MigrateSense AI – Intelligent Azure Migration Assistant

🧠 What Is This Project?
MigrateSense AI is a smart tool (web application) that helps companies move their existing systems (like servers, databases, applications) from their on-premise setup (like in a company data center) to the Azure cloud platform.
This process is called cloud migration, and it can be complicated. MigrateSense AI makes it easier using AI to:
* Analyze information about each system (like RAM, OS, database, usage, etc.)
* Suggest how to migrate each one (using the “6 Rs” strategy)
* Recommend matching Azure cloud services
* Generate a simple report showing all results
You’re building a light version of a professional tool that cloud engineers would actually use during real-life migrations.

📊 What Problem Does It Solve?
Companies often don’t know:
* Which systems to migrate first
* What strategy to use for each system
* Which Azure service fits best
* What it will cost
Your project helps solve this using automation + AI to save time, reduce risk, and help plan better.

🛠️ What Will This App Do?
1. Let user upload a file (CSV or JSON) containing system/workload details (example: server name, OS, database used, CPU, memory)
2. Automatically analyze each workload and classify it into a migration strategy:
    * Rehost (move to VM)
    * Refactor / Replatform
    * Rearchitect
    * Repurchase
    * Retire
    * Retain
3. Suggest matching Azure services (e.g., Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure VM)
4. Use AI (like GPT) to provide natural-language explanations/recommendations
5. Generate a migration report (HTML or PDF) summarizing the results

📦 Example Input:
A CSV file like this:
Workload Name	OS	DB	CPU	RAM
Billing-Server	Windows	SQL Server	4	16GB
WebPortal	Linux	MySQL	2	8GB
FinanceApp	Legacy	Oracle	8	32GB
📋 Example Output:
Workload	Strategy	Azure Service	AI Suggestion
Billing-Server	Rehost	Azure VM + SQL MI	Lift & shift for now
WebPortal	Replatform	Azure App Service + MySQL	Containerization possible
FinanceApp	Repurchase	Dynamics 365	Move to SaaS ERP
🧰 What You’ll Need (Tools & Tech Stack)
💻 Frontend (User Interface):
* Streamlit (easiest way to create a web app using Python) OR
* Angular/React (optional, more advanced)
🖥️ Backend:
* Python + FastAPI or Flask
    * Reads uploaded file
    * Applies logic/AI
    * Generates report
🤖 AI:
* OpenAI GPT (gpt-3.5-turbo)
    * For intelligent suggestions like: "This server is a good candidate for replatforming to Azure App Service"
📁 Input Format:
* CSV or JSON file containing workloads (app/server/system data)
📄 Output:
* Table on screen
* Downloadable HTML/PDF report
* Simple charts (bar chart of migration strategies)

🚀 Step-by-Step Development Plan
✅ Week 1 (Days 1–10)
1. Learn basics of Streamlit or Flask (if needed)
2. Build file uploader for CSV/JSON
3. Parse and display the data
4. Write logic for 6Rs classification (rules-based at first)
5. Add AI (OpenAI GPT) to explain the reasoning
✅ Week 2 (Days 11–20)
1. Add recommendations (Azure service suggestions)
2. Generate output report (HTML or downloadable PDF)
3. Add simple bar charts (like “3 workloads → Rehost, 2 → Retire”)
4. Final testing + Polish UI
5. Record demo + prepare for submission

🎁 What You'll Deliver at the End:
* A web app: upload → analyze → recommend → report
* Source code (well commented)
* Sample input/output files
* Project report: explaining your logic, flow, and how AI is used
* Short video demo (optional but great!)

❓ Don't Worry If You're New To:
* Azure Services – You don’t need to use Azure, only recommend services based on workload type
* AI/LLMs – You’ll use GPT with simple prompt engineering
* DevOps/Deployment – You can run the app locally or use Streamlit Cloud for hosting
